# add unigrams+bigrams
# + new dictionary lueke
# + wordnet effect (64+).
#
# save it as sparse matrix and then pickle.
# + SVM with linear kernel.
# use lueke for sintement analysis.
# 1. convert everything to unigrams(TF-IDF encoding)
# 2. for every group of features "class" have a model (LR and SVM)
# 3. have 1 model that combines all features (LR and SVM)
