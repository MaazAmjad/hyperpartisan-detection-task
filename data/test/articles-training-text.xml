<article id="0000001" published-at="2017-09-10" title="After DeVos Announced Plans To Reexamine Title IX, Texas Attorney Tweets He Would 'Be Ok If [She] Was Sexually Assaulted'"><p>When explaining her decision to reevaluate Title IX guidelines as they pertain to sexual assault on college campuses, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/betsy-devos-overhaul-obama-era-guidance-campus-sex-assault-n799471" type="external">said</a>: ?Every survivor of sexual misconduct must be taken seriously. Every student accused of sexual misconduct must know that guilt is not predetermined.?</p>
<p>The Obama administration?s changes to Title IX have been <a href="" type="internal">criticized</a> for, among other things, substantially lowering the burden of proof as it pertains to sexual assault, as well as denying elements of due process to the accused.</p>
<p>However, many progressives are lashing out at DeVos because they hate her, and also rape culture and stuff.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most grotesque attack came when Rob Ranco, a Texas attorney, tweeted Friday that ?I'm not wishing for it ? but I'd be ok if #BetsyDevos was sexually assaulted. #Sexual Assault #TitleIX.?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/sep/9/rob-ranco-texas-lawyer-says-he-would-be-ok-if-bets/" type="external">The Washington Times</a> reports that in several other tweets (condensed for this publication), Ranco wrote: ?Perhaps Betsy doesn?t understand how horrible rape is. She?s made the world more dangerous for my daughters. I need her to understand,? and ?Make the world more dangerous for my daughters ? intentionally ? and your well being is not my concern. Full stop.?</p>
<p>Ranco's additional tweets don't make his first one any less vile.</p>
<p>In the wake of the overwhelming negative response, Ranco locked his Twitter profile, then <a href="https://www.redstate.com/brandon_morse/2017/09/09/cowardly-austin-lawyer-wished-sexual-assault-betsy-devos-locked-twitter-account/" type="external">deleted</a> it.</p>
<p>Many on social media are calling for the attorney to be fired from The Carlson Law Firm, where he is a partner, or even disbarred:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet" type="external">@PrisonPlanet</a> I'm wishing for it... but I'd be ok if <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RobRanco?src=hash" type="external">#RobRanco</a> was disbarred.</p>
<p>As of this publication, the law firm?s Twitter account has also been locked, though Ranco is still listed on the official website?s ? <a href="https://www.carlsonattorneys.com/team-member/robert-ranco/" type="external">Team</a>? section.</p>

<article id="0000002" published-at="2017-05-05" title="University To Award Trayvon Martin With Posthumous Degree In Aviation"><p>A Florida university will honor Trayvon Martin with a posthumous Bachelor of Science Degree in Aviation at a May 13 commencement ceremony. The degree will be accepted by his parents, Tracy Martin and Sabrina Fulton.</p>
<p>Seventeen-year-old Martin was killed in February of 2012 by former neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, in self-defense. After a long, racially-charged public debate and court trial, Zimmerman was completely exonerated in July of 2013.</p>
<p>Florida Memorial University officially <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FLMemorialUniv/" type="external">announced</a>the posthumous degree via Facebook on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The University will confer upon TRAYVON MARTIN a posthumous degree in Aeronautical Science with a concentration in Flight Education, in honor of the steps he took during his young life toward becoming a pilot," says the Facebook post. "This particular Bachelor?s degree is designated for those studying to be pilots. Martin?s parents, both social justice activists and co-founders of The Trayvon Martin Foundation ... will accept the degree on behalf of their son."</p>
<p>?Of special significance is awarding posthumously the Bachelor of Science Degree in Aviation to Trayvon Martin. Sybrina, our alum, epitomizes strength and dignity as she uplifts other victims of violence while effecting change for a more equal and just society," said Florida Memorial University President Dr. Roslyn Clark Artis.</p>
<p>Additionally, the school will host a post-commencement fundraiser which will partly support The Trayvon Martin Foundation.</p></article>
<article id="0000008" published-at="2017-11-15" title="Texas State University suspends Greek life after student death"><p>Nov. 15 (UPI) ? Texas State University has suspended all Greek life activity on campus after a pledge died after attending an event hosted by a university fraternity.</p>
<p>Police officers found Matthew Ellis, a 20-year-old Phi Kappa Psi pledge, dead on Monday after they responded to an off-campus call. Ellis attended a Greek life event on Sunday hosted by fraternity members, but it is unclear if the event was hosted by one fraternity or multiple fraternities.</p>
<p>Although an autopsy has been ordered, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/hazing-in-america/texas-state-university-suspends-greek-life-activity-after-frat-pledge-n820946" type="external">a preliminary investigation suggested alcohol poisoning</a> as a factor in the student?s death.</p>
<p>Phi Kappa Psi Executive Director Mark Guidi said that the organization is ?heartbroken.?</p>
<p>?Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and the entire TSU student body during this difficult time,? Giudi said.</p>
<p>Texas State University President Denise M. Trauth <a href="http://www.txstate.edu/news/news_releases/news_archive/2017/November-2017/Greeks111417.html" type="external">released a statement</a> announcing the suspension of Greek life activity on campus.</p>
<p>?I am deeply saddened by the tragic death of one of our students who attended an off-campus social event on Sunday evening hosted by members of a university fraternity,? Trauth said.</p>
<p>?As a result of this tragedy, I have suspended activities of all Greek fraternity and sorority chapters at Texas State. These chapters are prohibited from holding new-member events, chapter meetings, social functions, and philanthropic activities until a thorough review of the Greek Affairs system is completed.?</p>
<p>Trauth also said Vice President for Student Affairs Dr. Joanne Smith would ?immediately initiate this review? and would ?propose recommendations? for the Greek chapters to show their ?commitment to the core values of Texas State.?</p>
<p>?It is imperative that our entire university community develop a culture that places the highest priority on the safety of its students, faculty, and staff.?</p></article>
<article id="0000009" published-at="2015-06-10" title="Red Sox waste Rodriguez outing in 1-0 loss to Orioles"><p>BALTIMORE (AP) ? On a night in which Boston didn?t score a run and plummeted into last place in the AL East, there was reason for optimism in Red Sox Nation.</p>
<p>Rookie Eduardo Rodriguez turned in another sharp performance, one that made a 1-0 loss to the Baltimore Orioles on Tuesday night far easier to swallow.</p>
<p>Rodriguez allowed three hits and three walks over six shutout innings. The former Orioles prospect was vying to become the first left-hander since Kazuhisa Ishii of the Dodgers in 2002 to win his first three major league appearances.</p>
<p>?Through three starts, we?re looking at a pretty special young man,? Red Sox manager John Farrell said.</p>
<p>Obtained by Boston last July in the trade that sent reliever Andrew Miller to Baltimore, Rodriguez struck out seven and lowered his ERA to 0.44. The 22-year-old has yielded only eight hits and a run over 20 1/3 innings.</p>
<p>?What he does so well is he?s able to come back out and establish strike one, even to the first hitter of the inning,? Farrell said. ?He?s done a great job of remaining focused pitch-to-pitch.?</p>
<p>After spending four years in the Orioles? minor league system, Rodriguez is now a star with one of Baltimore?s division rivals.</p>
<p>?I?m sure there?s some guys, if they could pick a scenario, that he would pitch well and we?d win,? Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ?I don?t wish bad on anybody. I know one thing: The Red Sox will trade with us again. If you always make a pretty even trade, they like working with you.?</p>
<p>Steve Pearce scored in the seventh inning on a wild pitch by Matt Barnes, and the Orioles won for the fourth time in five games. Chad Roe (1-0) pitched 1 1/3 innings to earn his first AL victory, and Zach Britton got five outs for his 16th save.</p>
<p>Barnes (2-1) entered in the seventh and immediately gave up the game?s first run. Pearce doubled, took third on a single by J.J. Hardy and came home when Barnes bounced a breaking ball past catcher Blake Swihart.</p>
<p>With two on and one out in the eighth, Britton replaced Roe and struck out David Ortiz and Mike Napoli to blunt Boston?s final threat.</p>
<p>Red Sox left fielder Hanley Ramirez was removed in the third inning with a bruised left knee. After fouling a ball off his leg, Ramirez remained on the ground for several minutes before resuming his at-bat. He drew a walk and left for a pinch runner.</p>
<p>Orioles starter Miguel Gonzalez departed in the fifth inning with a right groin strain after giving up four hits and a pair of walks.</p>
<p>He was replaced by T.J. McFarland, who got two straight outs to strand a runner on third base.</p>
<p>In the bottom half, Baltimore got two runners on with no outs before Rodriguez retired Manny Machado on a fielder?s choice and struck out Delmon Young and Adam Jones. After Jones swung through a third strike, Rodriguez enthusiastically pounded his right fist into his glove four times as he walked off the mound.</p>
<p>?Men on first and second with two outs and then strike him out like that,? the lefty said. ?It?s big for me.?</p>
<p>Rodriguez finished with a 1-2-3 sixth inning, getting the final out on a close play at first base in which Nolan Reimold was ruled out after a replay review overturned the initial call.</p>
<p>THIS AND THAT</p>
<p>Red Sox: Rodriguez is the first Red Sox pitcher since 1914 to begin his career with at least seven strikeouts in each of his first three starts. ... Boston has lost seven of its last eight road games. ... It was the fifth time Boston has been shut out since May 8.</p>
<p>Orioles: Showalter has 1,286th career wins, one behind Charlie Grimm for 32nd place on the career list. ... The last time Baltimore beat Boston 1-0 and neither team recorded an RBI was April 9, 1976.</p>

<article id="0000010" title="Eve and the New Jerusalem"><p>Imaginings of a utopian, or utopian socialist, future can be traced from chapters in Scripture to present-day works. The 19th century was particularly fruitful in this respect; it not only produced works of literary imagination but abounded in significant, organized movements in Europe, some of them exported to this country, aiming to mobilize communities on egalitarian principles. But as it concerns the liberation of women, none was more energetic than that of the Owenites in England (who were among those roundly condemned as ?unscientific? by Friedrich Engels). They were founded by Robert Owen, a Welsh manufacturer who first experimented with a kind of anticapitalist ?social engineering? in his own mills, then turned to organizing a general movement for the betterment of men and women? and to this Barbara Taylor directs her primary interest in a richly detailed book, Eve and the New Jerusalem, from which we excerpt a brief section below.</p>
<p>Feminism and socialism were not always partners but they did come together, the author argues, in the Owenite movement. She writes: ?One hundred and fifty years later, however, it is precisely this aspect of Owenism?its theoretical and practical commitment to women?s liberation?which is least remembered. . . . To Robert Owen and his followers, particularly his feminist followers, socialism represented a struggle to achieve ?perfect equality and perfect freedom at every level of social existence.'? In this book, Barbara Taylor has rectified a gap in historical scholarship, including that of the left. We have had to delete numerous footnotes that provide evidence in support of her contentions.?Eds.</p>

<article id="0000012" published-at="2016-09-26" title="Jewish Organization's Huge Day Of Unity On Tuesday"><p>Against the backdrop of an increasingly polarized political landscape, one organization is issuing a clarion call for collective unity and understanding. On Tuesday, Acheinu, a Jewish missionary group working to draw Jews closer to the traditional core of Judaism, is holding a <a href="http://dayofjewishunity.com/" type="external">Day of Jewish Unity</a> to consolidate the disparate voices of the diaspora in a seven-hour period (7 am- 2pm) of sober reflection.</p>
<p></p>
<p>?Orchestrated by the Acheinu organization, the Day of Jewish Unity was born: a revolutionary initiative designed to unify all Jewish people from around the world in a day of prayer on behalf of the current -and cautioning ? state of affairs, both nationally and internationally,? explains the event?s webpage.</p>
<p>Under the hashtag #DayofJewishUnity, Acheinu is working to mobilize one million Jews of varied ideological orientations from around the world to take a step back and reexamine the often petty and disorienting political divisions that divide us. The event is open to people of all faiths, but Acheinu is specifically marketing its message to Jews, many of whom have felt marginalized or overshadowed by the forceful social currents of grievance-based identity politics.</p>
<p>Watch Acheinu?s promotional video below:</p>
<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/182868992" type="external">Will the character assassination ever stop...</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/dayofjewishunity" type="external">Day of Jewish Unity</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com" type="external">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>In previous years, the annual Day of Jewish Unity has galvanized hundreds of thousands of people from Jerusalem to New York City, thanks to Acheinu?s powerful videos and promotional material. In fact, the organization drew a record-setting 500,000 participants in the 2015 event. This year, they plan on doubling that.</p>
<p>As Americans, and quite frankly, people across the world, set to watch what will likely be one of the most cynical and rancorous debates in modern history on Monday night, it?s worth remembering that tribalism and partisanship don?t have to define us.</p>
<p>?There is no civility in politics anymore. Our politicians cannot get anything passed because of so much animosity,? notes the event?s webpage. adding:</p>
<p>We need to have bipartisan decency and respect for our counterparts. There once was a time when members of Congress would call their colleagues from the other side of the aisle their "friends." This year, the Presidential candidates didn't even congratulate each other after they won their respective races.</p>
<p>Purposely scheduled less than 24 hours after the Clinton-Trump showdown, the Day of Jewish Unity is designed to counter the scourge of bitter political division infecting public discourse.</p>
<p>If you?re feeling jaded after Monday?s debate, then there may be an outlet or perhaps even a way to reinstate your faith in humanity. To partake in Tuesday?s Day of Jewish Unity, Acheinu is asking event participants to do two simple things:</p>
<p>Recite two chapters of Psalms</p>
<p>Refrain from speaking gossip and harmful speech</p>

<article id="0000015" published-at="2016-11-29" title="BREAKING: Trump Reaches Agreement To Keep 1,000 Carrier Jobs In Indiana, Keeping Major Campaign Promise"><p>President-elect Donald Trump has reached an agreement with United Technologies (UTC) to keep 1,000 Carrier jobs in the state of Indiana, according to CNBC. Both Trump's transition and Carrier have confirmed that a deal has indeed been struck.</p>
<p>BREAKING: Trump team and United Technologies reach agreement on keeping close to 1,000 factory jobs in Carrier plant in Indiana - sources</p>
<p>We are pleased to have reached a deal with President-elect Trump &amp;amp; VP-elect Pence to keep close to 1,000 jobs in Indy. More details soon.</p>
<p>The company had planned on moving thousands of jobs to Mexico, to the chagrin of workers and labor groups. On Thanksgiving Day, Trump said via Twitter that he was ?working hard? to ?get Carrier A.C. company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana).? After days of negotiation with Carrier, he seems to have succeeded in keeping his campaign promise.</p>
<p>I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon!</p>
<p>Manufacturing jobs have been increasingly exported to foreign countries, including China and Mexico over the last few decades. Hundreds of thousands of blue collar workers have been laid off as a result. American manufacturers say, however, that in order to stay competitive in the global economy they need to keep costs low. The most efficient way to do that is to hire cheap foreign labor. Carrier Corp was looking to follow this formula to keep profit margins in the green.</p>
<p>?The jobs at Carrier Corp. are on the way to Mexico because the company concluded that it could not stay competitive and reward its shareholders unless it took advantage of lower production costs south of the border,? <a href="http://www.courant.com/business/hc-trump-carrier-20161128-story.html" type="external">reports</a> CNBC. ?Things are as simple as that??</p>
<p>But Trump (or Mike Pence, who is still the governor of Indiana) managed to work his magic and convince Carrier?s parent company, UTC, to keep 1,000 jobs in Indiana where manufacturing jobs have been hemorrhaging for decades.</p>
<p>Promising a combination of tax relief and regulation easing, Trump made an offer UTC couldn?t refuse. Left-wing economic populists like Bernie Sanders pushed Trump to make Carrier stay in the United States, suggesting that it was something the Trumpian right and labor left could agree on. Rather than incentivizing the conglomerate, Sanders and his allies were looking to use UTC?s multi-billionaire business relationship with the Pentagon as leverage. While Trump had promised to deploy similarly coercive tactics, such as high tariffs and penalties on companies that ship jobs abroad, he ultimately took a free market approach to the problem.</p>
<p>During the presidential campaign, Trump called out Carrier by name and used the air conditioning company as an example of the worker unfriendly economic environment the United States has become.</p>
<p>?From the earliest days of his campaign, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/donald-trump?inline=nyt-per" type="external">Donald J. Trump</a> made keeping manufacturing jobs in the United States his signature economic issue, and the decision by Carrier, the big air-conditioner company, to move 2,000 of them from Indiana to Mexico was a tailor-made talking point for him on the stump,? <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/business/trump-to-announce-carrier-plant-will-keep-jobs-in-us.html?smid=tw-share" type="external">explains</a> The New York Times.</p>
<p>Championing a populist economic message, Trump vowed to keep more jobs here in the United States. While technology will likely continue replacing manufacturing jobs at a much faster rate than foreign labor ever could, the billionaire businessman?s Carrier deal is a symbolic victory for the ?America first? Trump movement.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, it?s a good way to start a presidency. However, there?s only so much the federal government can do to alleviate the economic hardship of the Rust Belt, America?s manufacturing heartland. The steamboat of globalization and technological innovation cannot be tamed, let alone reversed. In short, there won?t be a manufacturing renaissance. That?s a pipe dream.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it looks like Trump came through this time around.</p>
<p>Trump and future vice-president/current Indiana governor. Mike Pence plan on holding a event at the Carrier plant in Indiana on Thursday.</p></article>

<article id="0000020" title="ANALYSIS: Does gay debate mirror church dispute on slavery?"><p>WASHINGTON&amp;#160;(RNS) ? One group of Christians confidently proclaims that a plain reading of the Bible is a slam-dunk in their favor. The other side appeals to Scripture?s grand narrative toward freedom and inclusive love.</p>
<p>The argument boils over and ripples through the wider culture.</p>
<p>The search for middle ground proves futile. Denominations break apart.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? It could be 2010 ? or the mid-19th century.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As churches and denominations in the United States slog through divisive and long-running arguments over homosexuality, many Protestant progressives have sought to claim the historical and moral high ground by aligning their cause with abolitionism.</p>
<p>?I think almost everybody who makes the liberal argument about homosexuality makes the connection with abolition and slavery,? said Jeffrey Krehbiel, a Washington, D.C., pastor in the Presbyterian Church (USA) who supports gay rights.</p>
<p>Abolitionists, he said, ?were the first to make the argument that the plain reading of the text maybe isn?t the most fruitful way to read the Bible.?</p>
<p>But while there are striking parallels between the slavery and homosexuality debates, historians caution that important differences emerge upon close examination.</p>
<p>In both eras, cultural trends forced Christians to question practices that long had been taken for granted, said Mark Noll, a professor of American religious history at the University of Notre Dame and author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0807830127?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=wwwbaptiststa-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0807830127" type="external">The Civil War as a Theological Crisis</a>.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Bible, and how to interpret it, has played a central role both then and now, Noll said.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, even some Northern abolitionists concluded the Bible condoned slavery.</p>
<p>Many, therefore, sought other sources of morality and methods of biblical interpretation; conservatives countered that such appeals undermined the power of the sacred text.</p>
<p>As conflict heated up, Noll writes in his book, slavery?s defenders increasingly saw ?doubts about biblical defense of slavery as doubts about the authority of the Bible itself.?</p>
<p>As with slavery, few Christians are neutral on homosexuality.</p>
<p>?Like the situation in the 1830s and ?40s, once a certain kind of heat is generated, it becomes really hard to talk through these various kinds of debating strategies and implications,? Noll said.</p>
<p>Methodists, Presbyterians, Baptists ? and to some extent, Episcopalians ? all split over slavery, mainly along the Mason-Dixon Line. Some reunited decades later. Baptists re-main apart to this day.</p>
<p>Likewise, in the last few years, a number of mainline Protestant congregations have parted with their denominations over homosexuality, although in far fewer numbers than during mid-19th century splits.</p>
<p>But the exodus may not be over. For example, conservative Presbyterians and United Methodists have threatened to leave en masse if their denominations decides to allow gay clergy and same-sex marriages.</p>
<p>?The parallels to the contemporary debate are fairly striking,? said Mark Valeri, a professor of church history at <a href="http://www.upsem.edu/" type="external">Union Presbyterian Seminary</a> in Richmond, Va.</p>
<p>?You have a long-simmering moral dispute that heats up an ecclesiastical and political question, which results in a division.</p>
<p>?And the question is, when the division creates branches, how courts adjudicate those disputes.?</p>
<p>But there are key differences between the disputes over slavery and homosexuality, some historians say.</p>
<p>For instance, many conservatives say that it is not simply the gay issue that is driving them out the door, but a long liberal trend in mainline denominations that stretches back 30 years or more.</p>
<p>Second, Scripture shows only a grudging tolerance of slavery, a far cry from its ringing endorsement of heterosexual unions, argues <a href="http://www.robgagnon.net/" type="external">Robert Gagnon</a>, an associate professor of New Testament at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary.</p>
<p>?What kind of legitimate analogy can be made between the two? In my opinion, absolutely none. It?s just night and day,? he said.</p>
<p>Moreover, what seem like similar clashes over biblical interpretation can mask the role of self-interest in the debates.</p>
<p>Southern plantation owners ? and the pastors they built churches for ? had a huge financial stake in the slavery debate, said Charles Irons, an assistant professor of church history at North Carolina?s Elon University.</p>
<p>Today, it is not easy to see where the financial?or political?advantage lies in supporting or opposing gay rights, he said.</p>
<p>There?s one final ? and significant ? difference. Noll notes the theological crisis over slavery ultimately was decided politically by generals and armies.</p>
<p>Almost everyone agrees the homosexuality debate more likely will be settled by judges and lawmakers.</p></article>
<article id="0000021" published-at="2012-01-06" title="Slideshow: Salvaging Burned Books in Egypt"><p>In December, clashes in Egypt between pro-democracy protesters and security forces shook downtown Cairo for nearly two weeks. The clashes reportedly began after a pro-democracy protester was beaten by the police.</p>
<p>In the ensuing chaos, more than a dozen people died. But they weren't the only casualties.</p>
<p>Egypt's Scientific Institute, formed in 1798 by Napoleon Bonaparte, was burned and thousands of rare books were destroyed.</p>
<p>In the basement of the Egyptian National Library, a remarkable rescue effort is underway. Teams of researchers, book restorers and volunteers are attempting to save 193,000 rare manuscripts, books and scientific journals.</p>
<p>The books are in a sad state. Burned by fire and then drenched when desperate firefighters tried to extinguish the flames.</p>
<p>Magdi Montassir is vacuuming-packing the wet books. He gently places each book into a plastic bag, then puts the book into a machine that looks a little like a photocopier.</p>
<p>He closes the lid, turns a dial and the bag fills up with air. Then, every bit of air is pushed out with a sharp whoosh.</p>
<p>"The machine sealing the bag,"? Montassir says. "Empty oxygen, nitrogen, okay? Now, close the machine. Now the machine work. Look. And now it gives oxygen and becomes empty. No oxygen, no grow of bacteria or no fungi."?</p>
<p>The vacuum-packed books are stacked haphazardly in a basement hallway. The sight of thousands of rare volumes cascading in piles in a dimly-lit hallway is shocking. But there's just no other place for them.</p>
<p>Up on the roof of the Egyptian National Archives, even more books are drying out in the sun. They're lying on sheets of newspaper, held down by stones.</p>
<p>The fastest and easiest way to dry them is simply take them up to the roof of the building and let the Egyptian sun beat down on them.</p>
<p>Back downstairs, a young man in a white lab coat is slumped at a table aiming a neon blue hair dryer at a damp scientific journal.</p>
<p>Behind him is the crown jewel of Egypt's collection: an original copy of the Description D'Egypt, a description of Egyptian customs, art, culture and history that dates back to Napoleon's 1798 campaign.</p>
<p>The pages are burnt at the edges. Otherwise, the book is in decent shape.</p>
<p>The books are from the Institut D'Egypt, or Egypt's Scientific Institute. The building was a national treasure that most Egyptians didn't even know existed. With no government funding and no digitization of the volumes, historians describe it as a sleepy library that attracted researchers with lots of time and patience on their hands.</p>
<p>Whoever started the fire during the height of clashes between Egyptian protesters and security forces in December, probably didn't even know what he was destroying.</p>
<p>"We are a cultured people,"? says Zain El Din Mohammed Abdel Hati, chairman of the Egyptian National Library.</p>
<p>He's furious with the protesters who burned the Institute.</p>
<p>"I think who did this is the enemy of the Egyptian culture. In this moment, we have a lot of enemies,"? he says.</p>
<p>Abdel Hati has spent a good portion of the library's budget on the recovery effort. He is running out of money. And the rescuers are tired. Their nerves are frayed. Many of them are heartbroken about the loss.</p>
<p>Researcher Mohammed Hassan kneels in a basement room where fans have been turned on full-blast to help dry the books. The fans are pointed up at the ceiling to avoid disturbing the ashes and loose pages -all that is left of many books.</p>
<p>He is gently sifting burnt pages with a gloved hand.</p>
<p>Hassan won't throw away anything though ? not even the charred scraps.</p>
<p>Hassan: "Little, little, little paper. I keep it here,"? Hassan says.</p>
<p>Ruxandra Guidi: "It's impossible to tell which books those scraps of paper come from."?</p>
<p>Hassan: "Yes."?</p>
<p>GR: "So, why save them?"?</p>
<p>Hassan: "I need somebody who is specialist in these cases to tell me to throw it away. OK, I will throw. But until now, I must keep it safe."?</p>
<p>Until the experts can decide which books can be saved and which can't, volunteers will continue working for hours at a stretch ? with hair dryers and shrink wrap machines ? trying to salvage history, one page at a time.</p></article>
<article id="0000025" published-at="2016-02-11" title="How schools in Brazil are teaching kids to eat their vegetables"><p>On a hilly slope in S?o Paulo City, a group of sixth graders is busy at work. They?re armed with seeds, soil and a range of gardening tools. Upside-down soda bottles, filled with water, outline a series of rectangular garden plots. A boy named Felipy Pigato tells me they are preparing the soil for planting.</p>
<p>?Yesterday we mixed regular soil with coconut fiber,? he says. ?The coconut fiber holds the seeds in the soil.? &amp;#160;</p>
<p>Today, he says they will add in the compost. As the students dig, they pull back chunks of dirt, creating shallow pits, where earthworms wriggle in the freshly dug soil.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Mateus Feitosa de Almeida, 12, slowly pulls back the soil around a worm. ?We have to pull like that so we don?t hurt the worms,? he explains. ?If we take them out, it?s bad for the soil.?</p>
<p>This digging is going on in a quiet middle-class neighborhood, in a garden that belongs to Le?o Machado School, a large public school.</p>
<p>The students are working under the guidance of two teachers, Daniel Giglio Colombo and Marta Martins.</p>
<p>This is the second year of the project, says Colombo, who helped start the garden. ?We?re going to grow the same things we did last year ? arugula, lettuce, radishes.?</p>
<p>The vegetables they grow are used in school meals. But the real aim of the school garden is not to supply ingredients, he says, but to teach students where food comes from, so they can develop a connection to their food.</p>
<p>?When we ask students where lettuce comes from, they say the market,? Colombo says. ?They have lost contact with nature, the soil, sowing, and growing of crops.?</p>
<p>And that is reflected in their diets, he says, which are increasingly unhealthy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students say the school garden project is teaching them a lot about how to grow food, though it's still hard for some of them to appreciate vegetables.</p>
<p>Rhitu Chatterjee</p>
<p>Just like in the US, highly processed foods like fast food, soda, and high-fructose corn syrup have become all too popular here in Brazil. And obesity rates are rising, even among children. It is a nation-wide problem that has alarmed the government and public health experts in the country.&amp;#160;Brazil?s government has banned sodas, cakes&amp;#160;and cookies in school meals. It has restricted the amount of salt and sugar in them as well. It also requires at least one daily serving of fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>Initially, students used to reject fresh food, says Martins. She and her colleagues hoped that the school garden would change that.</p>
<p>?We wanted to create better habits with this project,? Martins says. ?We wanted them to improve their eating and become healthier.?</p>
<p>That idea is behind flourishing school gardens across Brazil. The program started 12 years ago as a pilot program in five schools, as part of a project by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Program. Today, there are a few thousand school gardens in 700 cities and towns. Many are run independently by schools. Others are supported by city governments.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>It?s hard to know yet whether school gardens have improved children?s health, says Albaneide Peixinho, who ran Brazil?s school meal program for 13 years. But she says schools are reporting that the gardens have made students more aware of their food.</p>
<p>?With school gardens, they see that food comes from the Earth,? Peixinho says, and they are eating healthier. Some studies even show that the students are influencing how their families eat. ?Parents say that the kids are eating a lot of fruits and vegetables, and they insist on eating those foods at home.?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sarah Campos (left) and Juliana Santos, former students of&amp;#160;the Le?o Machado School. Campos says she tried her first radish after working in the school garden. Now she loves them.</p>
<p>Rhitu Chatterjee</p>
<p>Sarah Campos, 14, took the school garden class last year at Le?o Machado in S?o Paulo. ?I had never eaten radishes before,? she says. But she tried some when she and her classmates cooked radishes they had grown in the school garden.</p>
<p>?I loved it so much that I even had a second plate,? Campos says. Now, she says she eats radishes often. ?I ask my mom to make them for lunch sometimes. She puts them in the salad with carrots, and with potatoes. It?s very good.?</p>
<p>She and her classmates say they are more open to eating vegetables now. They try to avoid fast food and they?re more conscious of their diets.Out in the garden, I ask Mateus, the student who told me about protecting earthworms, what he has learned in his gardening class.</p>
<p>?Many things,? he says. ?Like digging, what organic fertilizer is, what animals do to make the soil better.?</p>
<p>?What did you learn about vegetables?? I ask.</p>
<p>?That they are good for our health and well-being.? &amp;#160;</p>
<p>?Do you eat vegetables??</p>
<p>?I?m not so keen on them, but I guess I do now with this project,? he says, laughing sheepishly. &amp;#160;</p>
<p>The hope is that by the end of the school year, he will really enjoy them.</p>

<article id="0000027" published-at="2017-08-18" title="Massive venomous snake found under New Orleans home"><p>Aug. 18 (UPI) ? Wildlife removal experts discovered a large venomous rattlesnake underneath a home in Louisiana.</p>
<p>Gulf Coast Wildlife Removal <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/GulfCoastWildlifeRemoval/posts/?ref=page_internal" type="external">shared photos</a> Wednesday of the nearly 6-foot long canebrake rattlesnake that was found living under a homeowner?s deck in New Orleans.</p>
<p>?By far the biggest venomous snake we?ve encountered near the city,? the wildlife removal company said. ?Please keep a close eye out in these last few hot months of summer.?</p>
<p>Ryan Cook of Gulf Coast Wildlife removal <a href="http://www.fox8live.com/story/36159317/monster-snake-captured-beneath-new-orleans-east-home" type="external">told WVUE</a> he marveled at the size of the snake, noting that ?anything over 5 feet with a rattlesnake is considered a monster.?</p>
<p>?This one was 5 foot 8 inches and has 13 rattles on it, so it?s been around a good long time,? he said.</p>
<p>Cook added that he?s received reports of rattlesnakes in the area near the site of an old Six Flags amusement park.</p>
<p>?I?ve been hearing of a lot more rattlesnake activity in the New Orleans East area. I believe especially around the Six Flags area because it?s so overgrown. No one?s really doing anything to knock the numbers down, so you?re starting to see more and more of these guys showing up in residential neighborhoods,? he said.</p>
<p>The wildlife removal expert encouraged residents to keep their yards and homes clear of debris and other clutter that rattlesnakes can use to form a shelter.</p></article>
<article id="0000028" title="Meet The Anti-Refugee ?Hate? Group That Just Landed In The US From Finland"><p>A European-based anti-refugee group is finding a new home in the United States, according to a report from the <a href="http://www.adl.org/assets/pdf/combating-hate/Soldiers-of-Odin-USA-Report-web.pdf" type="external">Anti-Defamation League</a>, and catching fire with neo-Nazis and anti-government extremists.</p>
<p>The group?Soldiers of Odin?launched in Finland in 2015 and is named for a Norse god. Members of the group can often be seen in Finland patrolling the streets, wearing black jackets inscribed with a Viking and the Finnish flag and attempting to be vigilante ?eyes and ears for the police,? according to the ADL report.</p>
<p>The group represents a backlash to the rising number of refugees being resettled throughout Europe. In Finland, the number of refugees quickly ballooned from just little more than 3,000 in 2014 to 32,000 in 2015. The group has already spread across Europe from France to the U.K.</p>
<p>Now, the Soldiers of Odin are making moves in the U.S.</p>
<p>According to the ADL?s report, rumblings from the Soldiers of Odin USA began in February of this year. Unlike Europe, which is facing a massive refugee crisis, the number of refugees coming into the U.S. is still relatively small. And so far, Soldiers of Odin USA has mostly a web presence. Still, ADL estimates that there are at least 4,000 individuals linked to the U.S. group.</p>
<p>In March, the Soldiers of Odin chapter in Denver, Colorado held its first patrol. And the ADL reported that in Montana?where there is not even a refugee resettlement office?the backlash against refugees was so strong that ?more than 200 people tried to crowd into a [Flathead County] March 10 county commissioners meeting to express anti-refugee and anti-Muslim sentiments.? In March, a Soldiers of Odin group emerged to encourage individuals in the Flathead Valley to protest any Muslim refugee resettlement in the area.</p>
<p>?Europe waited until AFTER she was flooded with refugees to protest in large numbers. We will not make the same mistake in Montana,? <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SoldiersOfOdinFlathead/?fref=nf" type="external">the group?s Facebook page read.</a>?We all know that many of the Muslim refugees are causing massive amounts of crime, in particular sexual assault and rape of women and children. Soldiers of Odin peacefully patrols the streets to protect citizens.?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since April, the group has 42 state chapters in the U.S. and it has spent much of its time on recruiting and normalizing rules of the official organization. ADL?s Mark Pitcavage said that the group seems to be trying to build an organizational structure it can expand into. Members have also spent time trying to gather the official Soldiers of Odin gear.</p>
<p>?In their short existence so far, the Soldiers of Odin USA have spent most of their energy on recruiting, organization and trying to obtain Soldiers of Odin shirts and jackets?something in which it is clear members place great stock.?</p>
<p>The group maintains it?s not racist. In fact the Soldiers of Odin USA has taken special care to protect their image. In its patrol in Colorado, the group actually met to deliver food to the homeless. And its official by-laws include repeatedly the words ?non-racist.? The group has even selected a special marketing and research director to make sure that the group?s propaganda materials reflect a certain image, Pitcavage said.</p>
<p>However, its Finnish founder Mika Ranta is a known neo-Nazi, according to the ADL. And ADL points out that many of the members within the U.S. branch of the organization also have ties to white nationalism.</p>
<p>?An examination of the members and supporters leaves no room for doubt: though not all such adherents of the group are white supremacists or bigots, so many of them clearly are that the Soldiers of Odin can easily be considered a hate group,? the ADL wrote in its report.</p>
<p>ADL noted that William Johnson, a leader of the American Freedom Party who organized robocalls earlier this year in Iowa, Minnesota and New Hampshire on behalf of Donald Trump who <a href="" type="internal">he claimed could halt ?white genocide</a>? was aligned with the group as were ADL ? identified Alabama Klan leader Bradley Jenkins and Maryland skinhead Jason Tankersley.</p>
<p>It?s also clear that anti-Muslim sentiment is strong within the group. The ADL?s report included a dozen of the most brazen statements against Muslims posted from the group.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Pitcavage told TPM that one of the more confounding aspects of the new Soldiers of Odin group in the U.S. is that the organization seems to bring together both white nationalist and anti-government factions. The various extremist groups have typically kept their distance from one another, but the anti-Muslim sentiment appears to have united the previously incongruent groups in recent years.</p>
<p>Whether or not the various factions can successfully survive together, however, remains to be seen.</p>

<article id="0000035" published-at="2015-10-05" title="VIDEO: U.S. Reaches Trans-Pacific Partnership Deal With 11 Other Countries"><p>Almost 10 years in the making, the largest regional trade accord in history was agreed to Monday by the United States and 11 other Pacific Rim nations. The controversial <a href="" type="internal">Trans-Pacific Partnership</a> (TPP) represents ?a potentially precedent-setting model for global commerce and worker standards that would tie together 40 percent of the world?s economy, from Canada and Chile to Japan and Australia,? according to The New York Times.</p>
<p>In this NYT video, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman declares, ?We, the trade ministers ? are pleased to announce that we have successfully concluded the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiation.?</p>
<p>Froman says that what he calls the ?historic? TPP agreement will ?support jobs, drive sustainable growth, foster inclusive development and promote innovation across the Asia-Pacific region,? while also raising living standards.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The New York Times reports:</p>
<p>The Trans-Pacific Partnership still faces months of debate in Congress and will inject a new flash point into both parties? presidential contests.</p>
<p>But the accord ? a product of nearly eight years of negotiations, including five days of round-the-clock sessions here ? is a potentially legacy-making achievement for President Obama, and the capstone for his foreign policy ?pivot? toward closer relations with fast-growing eastern Asia, after years of American preoccupation with the Middle East and North Africa.</p>
<p>The Pacific accord would phase out thousands of import tariffs as well as other barriers to international trade. It also would establish uniform rules on corporations? intellectual property, open the Internet even in communist Vietnam and crack down on wildlife trafficking and environmental abuses.</p>
<p>Its full 30-chapter text will not be available for perhaps a month, but labor unions, environmentalists and liberal activists are poised to argue that the agreement favors big business over workers and environmental protection. Donald Trump has repeatedly castigated the Pacific trade accord as ?a bad deal,? injecting conservative populism into the debate and emboldening some congressional Republicans who fear for local interests like sugar and rice, and many conservatives who oppose Mr. Obama at every turn.</p>
<p>Long before an accord was reached, it was being condemned by both Mr. Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is challenging Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democrats? nomination. Other candidates also have been critical. Mrs. Clinton, who as secretary of state promoted the trade talks, has expressed enough wariness as she has campaigned among unions and other audiences on the left that her support is now in doubt.</p>

<article id="0000038" published-at="2017-03-04" title="Trump?s Desperate Attempt to Distract Americans From His Scandals Backfires ?Bigly?"><p>Donald Trump?s Saturday morning Twitter meltdown was flat-out unhinged, but his incompetence may have ultimately done nothing more than screw himself over.</p>
<p><a href="" type="internal">To his supporters</a>, Trump did nothing more than pander to the right-wing paranoia and irrational hatred of Barack Obama that helped him become a superstar among millions of conservatives. For most Americans, even many on the left, the true severity of this rant went unnoticed.</p>
<p>You see, when someone in Trump?s position does something like this, as opposed to a private citizen or even presidential candidate, there are a whole mess of legal issues that become involved.</p>
<p>For starters, a&amp;#160;president doesn?t have the power to single-handedly order a wiretap. Meaning that, if Trump or anyone associated with him were&amp;#160;monitored, a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA court)&amp;#160;would have had to grant&amp;#160;a warrant to do so. And the only way the FISA court would have done that is if they found probable cause.</p>
<p>In case you didn?t know, the FISA court was authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to oversee requests for surveillance of spies inside the United States by U.S. intelligence agencies. The Chief Judge&amp;#160;appointed to oversee the court is Rosemary Collyer, a United States District Court judge who was appointed by George W. Bush. She was then given her position on the FISA court by Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts ? who was also&amp;#160;picked by Bush and heavily supported by the Republican party.</p>
<p>So, right off the bat Trump?s claim, if true, would indicate that the evidence surrounding <a href="" type="internal">these Russian allegations</a> was sound enough that the FISA court found probable cause to approve the surveillance.</p>
<p>In other words, if we?re to take Trump at his word, it?s not&amp;#160;Obama&amp;#160;who ?bugged Trump Tower,? it was U.S. intelligence officials presenting evidence to the FISA court which then approved the monitoring of communication within that building over suspicion that Trump, or members of his campaign, engaged in possible <a href="" type="internal">treasonous contact with Russian officials</a>.</p>
<p>Most people have concluded that Trump?s tantrum was triggered by a Breitbart article ? which was based off comments made by right-wing conspiracy theorist Mark Levin ? claiming there?s a ?police state? being secretly run by Obama to create some sort of ?coup.?</p>
<p>Again, any wiretapping of Trump Tower would have been granted by the FISA court amid&amp;#160;overwhelming&amp;#160;evidence of Russian links to Trump or his associates. If Trump wants to continue to claim this is true, then he?s either accusing Barack Obama of a blatant crime that&amp;#160;should be investigated immediately, or he?s admitting that the FISA court found enough evidence of Russian ties to approve these supposed wiretaps.</p>
<p>So it?s either one or the other. Either Trump is:</p>
<p>Well, then there?s always the possibility&amp;#160;that, because <a href="" type="internal">he?s an unhinged moron</a>, he simply read this article in Breitbart, threw&amp;#160;another ridiculous hissy fit on Twitter, and he has absolutely no damn idea what he?s talking about. Hell, he compared this to Watergate, proving that he doesn?t even understand what the Nixon-era scandal was about.</p>
<p>But the kicker to this is, Trump?s incompetence has opened the door for a public reveal of the details surrounding why, if true, the FISA court approved any requests to monitor anything related to him or his associates. After all, even if you&amp;#160;think Trump?s mentally unstable, he was clearly serious when he made these comments. Considering the office he currently occupies, his words should then immediately require an independent investigation ? which means subpoenas ? that would ultimately bring practically anything and everything related to this into public light.</p>
<p>Because he has no idea what he?s doing, Trump has screwed himself over in several ways. If you take him at his word, and this is like ?Watergate,? then he?s going to have to order extensive independent investigations, along with Congress being involved, into what he claims was a blatant and extremely illegal order by a Barack Obama to have Trump Tower put under surveillance.</p>
<p>However, if he doesn?t do that, then he?s essentially admitting this whole rant was nothing more than pure ignorance, based on his trusting of a fringe, right-wing conspiracy site, and <a href="" type="internal">he?s too incompetent</a> to hold the position he currently occupies.</p>
<p>That or he?s aware of the FISA court granting these warrants, he thinks they were illegal and not justified, so he should order all the information contained within them to be made public to ?clear his name.? And if any FISA warrants related to investigations into him or his associates do exist, but he doesn?t want to make any of that information public, then he?s more or less admitting that they were credible and he doesn?t want people to know about the information that was used that led to their approval.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, Donald Trump?s stupidity has basically led to one of four main possibilities:</p>
<p>That&amp;#160;means the only positive outcome for Trump and Republicans is the extremely unlikely possibility that his accusations against Barack Obama are right. Otherwise, nothing good is going to&amp;#160;come of this for Trump or the Republican party.</p>

<article id="0000039" published-at="2017-05-24" title="2017's 3 Best Index Funds"><p></p>
<p>2017 has been a tumultuous year, with plenty going on in the political and financial realms. Yet the stock market has done quite well, and index funds that track popular stock benchmarks have given their investors solid returns. In particular, among the most popular exchange-traded funds, iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (NYSEMKT: EEM), PowerShares QQQ (NASDAQ: QQQ), and iShares Core MSCI EAFE (NYSEMKT: IEFA) have delivered some of the best returns.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>Data source: Fund providers, ETFdb.com.</p>
<p>Among U.S.-oriented index funds, the PowerShares QQQ leads the field with strong returns in the upper teens. The ETF tracks the <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/01/11/2016s-10-best-nasdaq-100-stocks.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness" type="external">Nasdaq 100 Index Opens a New Window.</a>, which is composed of the 100 top nonfinancial companies that trade on the Nasdaq exchange. Although intermingling of stocks across the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchanges over the past several years has made both indexes more diverse, the Nasdaq still has a preponderance of technology companies within its upper echelon. That makes the index particularly susceptible to tech-stock trends, and when technology is in the ascendancy -- as it has been so far in 2017 -- the Nasdaq does well.</p>
<p>The PowerShares QQQ does a good job of tracking the Nasdaq, with a relatively low 0.2% expense ratio taking only a minimal portion of the overall return of the index. With ample liquidity from plenty of trading volume every day, the PowerShares QQQ is an efficient way for you to tap into the profit potential of the Nasdaq and amplify your domestic stock exposure.</p>

<p>What's noteworthy, though, is that international markets have, in general, outpaced returns in the U.S. That's true both in other developed markets, where the MSCI EAFE index governs, and in emerging markets.</p>
<p>The two iShares funds represented here not only blanket the world between them, but also have different approaches toward their investing strategies and business models. The iShares Emerging Markets ETF tracks emerging-market stocks, and it's designed for use by institutional investors, with high trading volumes and ample liquidity. However, as you can see from the 0.69% expense ratio, the index fund is relatively costly compared to other ETFs.</p>
<p>It's true that investing in emerging markets involves more expense than buying and selling stocks in the U.S. and in other better-developed markets, but even so, the iShares offering isn't the most cost-effective solution. That's why it's noteworthy that the ETF has outpaced some of its lower-cost peers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF is an example of a lower-cost philosophy from iShares. <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/08/29/investors-think-these-are-best-international-etfs.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness" type="external">The core series of ETFs Opens a New Window.</a> are designed for longer-term investors, with less liquidity, but lower expenses. Investors have the opportunity to pay just 0.08% in annual expenses using the Core MSCI EAFE fund, and that compares quite favorably to the 0.33% expense ratio that its non-core iShares counterpart charges.</p>
<p>Overseas markets have done well so far in 2017. Improving economic conditions suggest that a long period of sluggishness might finally be coming to an end, and many investors have seen international stocks as being better bargains than the U.S. stock market, especially after eight years of bull-market conditions.

<article id="0000040" published-at="2015-05-18" title="Death Sentence for Morsi: Egypt?s Junta Takes Another Step Toward Being North Korea"><p>&amp;amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;amp;gt;This post originally ran on &amp;amp;amp;lt;a href="http://www.juancole.com/2015/05/sentence-another-toward.html" title="Juan Cole?s Web page"&amp;amp;amp;gt;Juan Cole?s website&amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;gt;.&amp;amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;gt;That the only freely elected president Egypt has ever known has been sentenced to death is only to be expected from the current military junta, which made a coup in July, 2013, and declared the former ruling party, the Muslim Brotherhood, to be a terrorist organization indistinguishable from al-Qaeda. Probably even under enormous pressure, some 20 percent of Egyptians at least somewhat identify with the Muslim Brotherhood (just as about 20 percent of Americans say they are evangelical Christians). To attempt to ban the entire religious Right as mere terrorists is a monstrous proceeding, and will inevitably produce the very terrorism it says it is trying to prevent.&amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;gt;As with so many recent Egyptian court rulings, the surprising thing is the judiciary?s willingness to go along with crackpot conspiracy theories.&amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;gt;Some Muslim Brotherhood leaders, including Muhammad Morsi, were imprisoned by the regime of Hosni Mubarak late in his presidency. On January 28, 2011, three days after big demonstrations broke out against Mubarak, Morsi and the others managed to escape from prison in the chaos of a collapsing regime. Afer Mubarak?s overthrow in mid-February, 2011, they set up a headquarters in the Muqattam Hills above the city. Ultimately they won both parliament and the presidency. But the judiciary struck down their victory in the national legislature on the grounds that they had cheated by running party candidates in independent constituencies (this is true). Then the presidency was taken away from them when millions came into the streets against Morsi on June 30, 2013, and the military took advantage of the unrest to stage a coup.&amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;lt;div class="sidebar__ad-label"&amp;amp;amp;gt;Advertisement&amp;amp;amp;lt;/div&amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="58577"&amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;lt;/broadstreet-zone&amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;gt;The charges on which Morsi could be executed &amp;amp;amp;lt;a href="http://elaph.com/Web/News/2015/5/1008423.html"&amp;amp;amp;gt; include that he and the other Muslim Brotherhood leaders smuggled out the plans of their high security jail&amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;gt; to members of Hamas, the Gaza party-militia, and to the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps and to the Lebanese Shiite party-miitia, Hizbullah. These nefarious terrorist forces then broke Morsi et al. out of jail on Jan. 28. It is being alleged that sharing the prison plans with terrorists is a form of espionage. That Morsi and the others escaped their incarceration is not in question. That they were broken out by Hamas, Hizbullah and the Revolutionary Guards in concert is a looney tunes theory for which there is no evidence, and it is a very dark matter to take a man?s life over charges that would elicit a derisive guffaw from most sane people.&amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;gt;The other charge is that beginning in 2005, the top Muslim Brotherhood leadership began conspiring with Hamas to throw the country into turmoil, a plan that eventuated in the January 25, 2011, revolution. That Mubarak was overthrown by the Muslim Brotherhood or more precisely by the Palestinian Hamas organization is an absurd proposition. The majority of the demonstrators in the capital and big northern cities were left-of-center youth, not the older religious Right. In fact, the Brotherhood leadership was clearly uncomfortable with the demonstrations, and many Brotherhood youth stayed home as a result, though I found one estimate that about a fourth of the demonstrators in Tahrir Square were Brotherhood. If you know anything about Egypt, you?ll recognize that that is a tiny proportion for the country?s largest opposition movement. Hamas didn?t overthrow Mubarak, and it is an insult to the hundreds of youth martyrs who gave their lives in 2011 to suggest that it did.&amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;gt;Ordinarily the Egyptian Field Marshall/ President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is careful to praise the Jan. 25 revolution. But now his sycophantic judge is essentially declaring it, as well, a terrorist conspiracy and making it one of the grounds to execute the elected former president.&amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;gt;Here is &amp;amp;amp;lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/press-releases/2015/05/egypt-court-recommends-death-sentences-for-morsi-more-than-100-others/%20"&amp;amp;amp;gt; Amnesty international?s&amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;gt; response:&amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;lt;blockquote&amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;gt; ?An Egyptian court?s recommendation today to sentence ousted president Mohamed Morsi and more than 100 other defendants to death after grossly unfair trials shows the deplorable state of the country?s criminal justice system, said Amnesty International.&amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;gt;?Condemning Mohamed Morsi to death after more grossly unfair trials shows a complete disregard for human rights. His trials were undermined even before he set foot in the courtroom. The fact that he was held for months incommunicado without judicial oversight and that he didn?t have a lawyer to represent him during the investigations makes these trials nothing but a charade based on null and void procedures,? said Said Boumedouha, Deputy Director of Amnesty International?s Middle East and North Africa Programme.?&amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;gt;I should underline that I think Morsi could well have been properly impeached for some of his actions while president and I am hardly a supporter of his wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. The 20 years Morsi was earlier given for sending plainclothes Brotherhood thugs to break up youth demonstrations late in 2012, in the course of which 6 youth were killed, seem to me to have at least the pretense of rationality and basic facts in their favor, though that wasn?t a fair trial, either.&amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;gt;But these charges and this sentence are not rational. They are like the rumors that North Korean dictator Kim Jung Un has fed his uncle to the dogs. Sisi and his fellow officers are beginning to act like Kim. They are unhinged. They even claim to have discovered a cure of AIDS in their military labs. (They haven?t).&amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;gt;Egypt under the jackboot of the brigadiers is fast becoming an international pariah. Even Sisi?s recent visit to Spain produced howls of outrage that he was allowed into Madrid.&amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;gt;Egypt?s stock market lost $26 billion &amp;amp;amp;lt;a href="http://www.albawaba.com/business/egypt%E2%80%99s-market-loses-26b-one-week-egx30-drops-5-percent-695184%20"&amp;amp;amp;gt; in the past week.&amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;gt; Tourism is still way down. Arbitrarily executing people is not a procedure calculated to give the public, whether domestic or international, any confidence.&amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;gt;</p></article>
<article id="0000041" published-at="2017-04-20" title="With tensions high, protests erupt across Venezuela"><p>New clashes erupted Thursday between Venezuelan riot police and President Nicolas Maduro's opponents, inflaming the tension after a day of deadly unrest in the beleaguered oil-rich nation.</p>
<p>Police backed by armored trucks fired tear gas to break up a large march as it reached a vital freeway in Caracas, then edged back slightly as masked protesters pelted them with stones.</p>
<p>Demonstrators vowed not to flinch in their campaign to oust Maduro, despite three weeks of protest violence that has left eight people dead, including three on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Sure we're tired, but we've got to stand strong. I'm ready to take to the streets every day if I have to," said 22-year-old student protester Aquiles Aldazoro.</p>
<p>Senior opposition leader Henrique Capriles vowed there would be "no surrender."</p>
<p>"It is our duty to defend the constitution," he said.</p>
<p>Protesters blame Maduro ? the heir of the leftist "Bolivarian revolution" launched by the late Hugo Chavez in 1999 ? for an economic crisis marked by severe shortages of food, medicine and basic goods.</p>
<p>Pressure on Maduro has been mounting since 2014, as falling prices for&amp;#160;Venezuela's crucial oil exports have sent the once-booming economy into a tailspin.</p>
<p>The crisis has escalated since March 30, when&amp;#160;Venezuela's Supreme Court moved to seize the powers of the legislature, the only lever of state authority not controlled by Maduro and his allies.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of protesters took part in Wednesday's marches, which erupted into clashes with security forces and armed groups of government supporters.</p>
<p>A 17-year-old boy and a 23-year-old woman died after they were shot in the head, and Maduro's camp said a soldier outside Caracas was also killed.</p>
<p>The opposition accuses Maduro of letting state forces and gangs of armed thugs violently repress demonstrators.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said one person had been arrested for the soldier's death, which he called a pre-meditated "act of fascism."</p>
<p>Numerous businesses and universities remained closed ? some in tacit support of the protests, others for fear of a repeat of the previous day's violence.</p>
<p>Looting erupted amid the chaos Wednesday. In the Paradise neighborhood in western Caracas, looters carted off food and beer from a series of ransacked businesses, residents said.</p>
<p>In poor neighborhoods traditionally loyal to Maduro, some protesters have cited hunger as their reason for joining calls for his ouster.</p>
<p>The escalation of&amp;#160;Venezuela's political crisis since late March has galvanized the often divided opposition in its efforts to force Maduro from power.</p>
<p>The president, in turn, has urged his supporters, the military and civilian militias to defend the "revolution."</p>
<p>International concern meanwhile continues to mount.</p>
<p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday urged all sides in&amp;#160;Venezuela&amp;#160;to take steps to ease tensions.</p>
<p>"We call for concrete gestures from all parties to reduce polarization and create the necessary conditions to address the country?s challenges," he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The European Union added to the condemnation, calling the deaths of protesters "highly regrettable" and urging all sides to "de-escalate."</p>
<p>The opposition has called for the military ? a pillar of Maduro's power ? to abandon him.</p>
<p>But the defense minister, General Vladimir Padrino Lopez, has pledged the army's "unconditional loyalty" to Maduro.</p>
<p>The president accuses the opposition of inciting a "coup" backed by the United States.</p>
<p>According to a survey by pollster Venebarometro, seven in 10 Venezuelans disapprove of Maduro, whose term does not end until 2019.</p>
<p>The president said Wednesday that he is ready to face his opponents at the ballot box.</p>
<p>"I want to have elections soon ... to seek a peaceful path so the revolution can put the conspirators, murderers and interventionist right-wingers in their place," he told a rally of supporters in central Caracas.</p>
<p>Regional elections due in December were indefinitely postponed and there is still no date for local polls due this year. The next presidential election is due in December 2018.</p></article>
<article id="0000043" published-at="2017-08-24" title="Survey: Nearly 80 Percent of Americans Live Paycheck to Paycheck"><p>Nearly 80 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, according to a survey released Thursday by <a href="http://press.careerbuilder.com/2017-08-24-Living-Paycheck-to-Paycheck-is-a-Way-of-Life-for-Majority-of-U-S-Workers-According-to-New-CareerBuilder-Survey" type="external">CareerBuilder.</a></p>
<p>The results:</p>
<p>?Living paycheck to paycheck is the new way of life for U.S. workers,? CareerBuilder spokesman Mike Erwin told <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/americans-living-paycheck-to-paycheck/" type="external">CBS News</a>. ?It?s not just one salary range. It?s pretty much across the board, and it?s trending in the wrong direction. Jobs have come back, but we haven?t seen salaries rebound.?</p>
<p>Further, 59 percent of Americans making $100,000&amp;#160;or more say they are in debt, and 70 percent of those making between $50,000&amp;#160;and $99,000&amp;#160;are in debt, according to the survey.</p>
<p>?As an employer, your employees? financial problems become your financial problems,? said Rosemary Haefner, chief human resources officer for CareerBuilder. ?If workers are constantly thinking about their financial struggles, their quality of work can decrease, and it can take a hit on their morale and productivity.?</p>
<p>The survey was conducted online within the U.S. by Harris Poll on behalf of CareerBuilder among 2,369 hiring and human resource managers ages 18 and over and 3,462 employees ages 18 and over between May 24 and June 16, 2017. There?s a 95 percent probability that the results have sampling errors of up to +/- 2 percentage points.</p></article>
<article id="0000046" published-at="2013-07-11" title="The truth about secession"><p>According to <a href="http://denver.cbslocal.com/2013/07/09/effort-to-create-new-state-called-north-colorado-grows/" type="external">CBS in Denver</a>, ?There?s a growing effort to create a 51st state out of parts of northeast Colorado.?</p>
<p>Organizers of the secessionist effort in a dozen rural counties in what some hope will become the state of ?North Colorado? say their interest in breaking away stems from the fact that their ?interests are not being represented at the state Capitol.?</p>
<p>We?re not talking here about a classic secession from the union, the kind Texas is always rumored to be on the verge of, but of the simple formation of a new state out of an existing one. West Virginia was created this way many moons ago, as were Maine, Kentucky, and Vermont.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Three other counties in Colorado and two in Kansas have also expressed interest in joining the secessionist movement. Leaders hope to have the measure voted on as early as November. Even if most voters decide that ?North Colorado? is a good idea, however, the bill will still have to gain approval from the Colorado General Assembly and the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>It may just be a temporary answer to the problem, anyway. Liberals have a way of invading the loveliest places in America and making them uninhabitable: e.g. Boulder, CO, Santa Fe, NM, and everywhere in California. What?s to stop liberals from moving in and undoing all the good secession might do? New Hampshire, where ?Live Free or Die? was once taken seriously, is looking more and more like Massachusetts every day. With massive immigration, even Texas is not immune from the trend.&amp;#160;Northern Colorado is a fast-growing area with lots of oil and gas that needs to be regulated.</p>
<p>Anti-secessionists love smugly to call Texas secession a pipe-dream on the basis that it <a href="http://ideas.time.com/2012/11/19/can-texas-really-secede-from-the-union-not-legally/" type="external">?isn?t legal.?</a> If you?re seceding, though, the goal is to break from the rules imposed upon you by the institution, so why would you stop and ask for its permission first? ?Is it alright, parent, if I refuse to heed the rule you told me to obey?? And why are <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeff-schweitzer/secession-movement_b_2191701.html" type="external">liberals against secession</a> in the first place? Do they enjoy tormenting conservatives so much that they?d rather live in disharmony with them than let us go our separate ways? As <a href="" type="internal">Pat Buchanan</a> put it, ??Can we all just get along?? Well, if we can?t, we can at least dwell apart.?</p>
<p>Another thing. Do these North Coloradoans not consider the aesthetics of the American flag? Maybe Texas should secede for real and then we won?t have to worry about an odd number of stars.</p>

<article id="0000053" published-at="2010-12-08" title="Calling From a Migrant Lockup in Arizona"><p>?We?re not criminals,? says the young man on the phone. ?I?m not here to use the system.?</p>
<p>If he could address the US Congress when it votes on the long-lost DREAM Act, 21-year-old Hector Lopez would ask for freedom from a ?106-day nightmare? that started in late August when American immigration authorities ripped him out of his tax-paying, college-going, hard-working life and deported him to Mexico.</p>
<p>He would happily save American taxpayers the money they are now spending on his room and board in a lockup built for migrants near Florence, Arizona.</p>
<p>?What I?ve said the whole time is that people like us?the college dreamers?didn?t have any choice. We were brought to this country as children and now we?re your future doctors, lawyers, and neighbors. We?re the future of this country and they?re trying to kick us out. Here you have people who are willing to fight for this country and all we?re asking is permission to call this country our home for the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>?Congress could enable so many productive people by passing the DREAM Act,? says Lopez. ?And they would be foolish not to.? With all the things that Lopez has to worry about on Tuesday night, the main thing that keeps his mind busy is how to manage the expectations of what Congress will do with the DREAM Act on Wednesday. ?The DREAM Act is finally being voted on,? he says. ?I?m trying not to think about it, but it?s making me a nervous wreck.?</p>
<p>Hope is a serious thing to contend with when you?re locked up in Arizona thinking about holiday food. If Congress passes the DREAM Act, Lopez has been advised by attorneys that he would be made a free man. The DREAM Act would make it legal for young folks like him to return to college, get back to work, and make a future in the hometowns of America.</p>
<p>?We could ask for my immediate release,? he says, letting his hope build up momentarily. ?So I?m hoping for the best. But on the other hand, I?m trying to stay pessimistic, too.? After all, it?s the US Congress we?re talking about here. They have had good days in history. Maybe even enough good days to make up for the bad.</p>
<p>Whichever way the DREAM Act goes this week, Lopez has backup plans. It?s been three weeks since he crossed the border from Mexico with papers in hand requesting a hearing for ?credible fear.? The hearing is usually done in two parts, says immigrant advocate Ralph Isenberg. Lopez is still waiting for part one.</p>
<p>?If people have to wait a long time for the hearing process to begin, that?s a problem in itself,? argues Isenberg from the office of his real estate business in Dallas. ?ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) has the discretion to release Hector to his home immediately.? Alongside the effort to free Lopez, Isenberg is also working for the return of another college dreamer, Saad Nabeel, who was deported from Texas in 2009 during the first semester of his freshman year.</p>
<p>If Congress and ICE continue to harass Hector, Saad, and the millions of college dreamers that they typify, then Isenberg will sponsor a civil rights delegation to visit Hector on Friday.</p>
<p>Rev. Peter Johnson was born into a civil rights family in Plaquemine, Louisiana. He was at the Freedom Rock Baptist Church the night state troopers rode their horses right up to the pulpit. That was the night James Farmer had to be smuggled out of town alive in a coffin.</p>
<p>?I want to tell Hector that he is not alone,? says Rev. Johnson over speaker phone. ?There are people all over the world who believe in dignity for all human beings and who have a problem with America when it sets out to destroy families.</p>
<p>?There is a long history of America destroying families,? says Johnson. ?Under slavery, they would send the father to Georgia, the mother to Alabama, and the children to Virginia. Today America is literally destroying families. I know of cases where a mother puts her kids in school for the day. The mother is picked up by immigration and sent to Haskell (Texas) prison. And when the children get out of school their mother is gone. They are literally destroying families.?</p>
<p>Johnson plans to take books by Gandhi and King as gifts for Lopez. He has a Gandhi book on nonviolence and a favorite by King, Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community?&amp;#160; Destroying families is chaos, not community. Where will we go from here?</p>
<p>?Look here,? says Isenberg jumping into the conversation. ?I?m reading the inscription in Rev. Johnson?s copy of Where Do We Go from Here? It says: ?Peter, Read this book. There will be a test. In fact, now that I think about it, life will be a test for you, (signed) Martin.??</p>
<p>?That?s right,? says Rev. Johnson, ?and when Dr. King gave you a book to read you made sure you read it because you knew he was going to question you about it.&amp;#160; Where Do We Go from Here was a book written in preparation for the Poor People?s Campaign (of 1968).&amp;#160; The Poor People?s campaign was going to unite Black and White and Hispanic people so they could confront the trap of poverty and unemployment.?&amp;#160; It was a handbook for a movement to come.</p>
<p>?King specifically talked about people South of the border. He said it was America?s moral obligation to help them find a better life.? The timing of Friday?s visit to Florence, Arizona will have three dimensions of significance for Rev. Johnson. It?s nearly a month away from the annual celebration of King?s birthday. The holiday season is coming, which is ?a season of forgiveness and atonement.? And finally, Dec. 10 will be the 62nd Anniversary for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
<p>?Fundamentally, the case of Hector Lopez is a question of human rights,? says Rev. Johnson. ?America is punishing a man who was brought here only weeks after he was born. In our treatment of Hector Lopez, we need to remember the human rights values of dignity and respect for all.?</p>

<article id="0000054" published-at="2016-01-29" title="Where is Apple?s ?Next Big Thing??"><p></p>
<p>Bad news for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL): The company needs to launch the ?next big thing? in order to reverse investors? soured sentiment according to Barclays Capital analyst Ben Reitzes, and that next big thing could be Apple?s HDTV.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>Why is that bad news? Because according to a recent report from The Wall Street Journal, the company?s TV set won?t be launching any time soon ? if it even launches at all.</p>
<p><a href="http://bgr.com/2012/12/12/apple-tv-next-big-thing/" type="external">See more tech stories on the FOX Business Technology homepage. Opens a New Window.</a></p>
<p>In a research note sent to clients on Tuesday evening, Reitzes ponders what might snap investors out of their ?recent funk.? Shares of Apple stock plummeted by as much as 25% in November from a high of $705.07, which was hit just before the iPhone 5 launched this past September. While some say ?people overbelieved in Apple? and the end is nigh, Reitzes thinks Apple just needs to launch the ?next big thing? to remind investors why it is the most successful consumer electronics company in the world.</p>
<p>Reitzes goes on to say that an Apple HDTV might be just what the doctor ordered and that a set-top box and service combination could do the trick as well. He sees Apple unveiling its big plans for the living room some time in 2013, and he says he believes Apple is ?exploring a new service that integrates iOS, iCloud, iTunes and more content that would bring customers a new experience around a TV-like device.?</p>
<p>The analyst continued, ?We believe that the Apple version of TV may evolve into a product that is ?always on? with the ability to display a variety of messages (texts, Facebook postings, Tweets, email, etc.), weather, pictures, news and other key information as well as even act as a video conferencing device [...] any Apple solution seems like it will need to work along side traditional cable and media arrangements. However, we see opportunity in Apple being able to perhaps work out deals with providers to gain access to channel guides and other key information in order to provide a more elegant integration experience.?</p>

<article id="0000056" published-at="2016-02-27" title="Supporters of Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Need to Acknowledge This Crucial Fact"><p>Currently there is a bit of a ?civil war? going on among progressives between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders supporters. During a primary season, that?s to be expected. Undoubtedly, it?s at this point during an election year when voters are most emotionally tied to a particular candidate. Primary elections often resemble sporting events more than political contests.</p>
<p>But what?s alarmed me most about this particular primary season&amp;#160;is the number of people threatening to ?sit out? or ?write-in? a candidate if their particular candidate doesn?t happen to win the nomination. A belief that I think is one of the <a href="" type="internal">most asinine stances I?ve ever heard</a>. If you think either Donald Trump, Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio would be better (or just as bad) as voting for either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, you are out of your damn mind.</p>
<p>I don?t care what your thoughts are of either Clinton or Sanders, on their worst day, either candidate is a million times better than anyone from the Republican party. And with the rights for millions of Americans at risk, as well as the Supreme Court and our progress on climate change, <a href="" type="internal">there?s too much at stake this election</a> to have any group of people not support the eventual Democratic nominee.</p>
<p>And while I have encountered a few Clinton supporters who?ve vowed not to support Sanders if he becomes the nominee (I?ve even been blocked by a few of them for calling them idiots), the ?my candidate or no one? crowd <a href="" type="internal">is mostly found among Sanders supporters</a>. Though I will gladly admit that the majority of those supporting Sanders do&amp;#160;understand the bigger picture and have said they plan to support whichever candidate ultimately wins the nomination.</p>
<p>To those people, I can?t thank them enough. In fact, I can?t thank anyone enough for realizing what?s on the line this election and why it?s so crucial that we all get out and ?vote blue, no matter who.? I don?t even want to think about how much damage Republicans will be able to do to this nation if we hand them the White House this November. <a href="" type="internal">It will make George W. Bush?s eight years</a> seem like a wonderful dream compared to the nightmare that a President Trump/Rubio/Cruz would inflict upon the country.</p>
<p>But there?s an irony to anyone who says that they?re going to take their ball and go home if their candidate doesn?t win, and it?s this:&amp;#160;Neither candidate can win without help from the supporters of their primary rival.</p>
<p>If Hillary Clinton wins the nomination, then half of all Sanders supporters decide not to support her, she likely&amp;#160;loses and we?re stuck with a President Trump/Rubio/Cruz.</p>
<p>But guess what?</p>
<p>If Bernie Sanders wins the nomination, then half of all Clinton supporters decide not to support him, he?s likely&amp;#160;going to lose and we?re going to be stuck with a President Trump/Rubio/Cruz.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is, whether each side wants to admit it or not, they both need each other this&amp;#160;November. Because come election day, if one group decides to let selfish ego and pride get in the way by not supporting the Democratic nominee, guess what?</p>
<p>We all lose.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>So, no matter what Clinton or Sanders supporters might think of one another, the reality is, they?re in this together ? whether they like it or not.</p>

<article id="0000058" published-at="2014-06-11" title="California Bill Demands ?Verbal or Written Consent? for Sex on College Campuses"><p>Don?t get me wrong, rape?on college campuses or anywhere else?is a very serious crime that should be punished severely. But when <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-California/2014/06/04/College-Students-May-Need-Verbal-or-Written-Consent-to-Have-Sex-on-Campus" type="external">lawmakers start demanding that college students obtain ?written or verbal consent?</a> before having sex, it?s a sign we?ve become a tad hysterical on this issue.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="" type="internal"></a> <a href="" type="internal"></a> <a href="http://www.laweekly.com/informer/2014/06/04/verbal-or-written-permission-could-be-required-for-college-sex" type="external">From LA Weekly:</a></p>
<p>Sounds quite unspontaneous. But a law co-authored by L.A. state Sen. Kevin de Leon would have state-run college campuses establish an ?affirmative consent? standard for its students.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>According to the language of the bill, SB 967, students who want to have sex must essentially establish that there has been ?an affirmative, unambiguous, and conscious decision by each participant to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity.??No more making sexy faces and sounds for you. You?ve got to verbalize. Or get it on paper.</p>
<p>Why not just require a notarized letter from an attorney, or better yet, a license? If we?re going to go this far, maybe college kids who want to have sex should go to a DMV-like office to get permission.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All joking aside, the fact that this is even an issue suggests that a lot of college kids are having sex they?re not comfortable with having. People don?t sign a waiver when they?re engaging in any activity with someone they know and trust. (My advice to college kids: if you feel like you need to have a written contract drawn up with your ?partner,? you shouldn?t be having sex with them.)&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/01/college-sexual-assault_n_5247267.html" type="external">Some of the colleges under investigation right now for mishandling sexual assault cases</a> are the most liberal, anything-goes, sexually open institutions in America. They host extravagant ?Sex Week? events and pass out condoms to freshmen. They talk a lot about ?consent,? but very little about respect, caring, or good judgment. Plying a ?yes? out of someone is all that matters.</p>
<p>In an environment like this, the boundaries of consent begin to break down. Students?who face enormous peer pressure to participate in this free-for-all?have trouble saying ?no? when they want to. Other students simply don?t respect a ?no.? Add a huge amount of alcohol into the mix, and chaos ensues.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is the problem that college administrators and lawmakers are trying to fix. But until they have the guts to criticize the culture on college campuses, they?ll get nowhere.</p>

<article id="0000059" published-at="2018-07-14" title="Unemployed Workers Need Benefits, but Republicans Still Say ?No.?"><p>On Sunday, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul explained his opposition to $26 billion in extended unemployment benefits for more than 1.3 million workers. ?I do support unemployment benefits for the 26 weeks that they?re paid for. If you extend it beyond that, you do a disservice to these workers,? he said in an <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/08/rand-paul-unemployment-benefits_n_4408046.html" type="external">interview</a> on Fox News Sunday. ?When you allow people to be on unemployment insurance for 99 weeks, you?re causing them to become part of this perpetual unemployed group in our economy,? he continued.</p>
<p>But this is wrong. The long-term unemployed are <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/12/rand-paul-couldnt-be-more-wrong-about-unemployment-insurance/282144/" type="external">victims of timing</a>; they lost their jobs at the start of the Great Recession, and were already long out-of-work by the following year, when the labor market began to improve in earnest. Additional stimulus would have helped?by filling the demand shortfall and strengthening the labor market?but Republican opposition left it off of the table. In other words, our inadequate response to the recession yielded a sluggish economy that can?t accommodate the millions of workers who lost their jobs in the initial crash and its aftermath.</p>
<p>Worse, employers <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/08/26/2524361/fault-long-term-unemployed-jobs/" type="external">all but punish people</a> for their absence from the workforce. In the eyes of a potential employer, being out of work for longer than nine months is equal to losing years of experience. Long-term joblessness?for the most part?is a recipe for permanent exclusion from the workforce, regardless of circumstances.</p>
<p>As for unemployment benefits? Rand Paul has it backwards. If generous benefits yield higher joblessness, it?s because people are more <a href="http://d.pr/f/55tK" type="external">willing to stay in the labor market</a> when they can afford food and shelter. Far from discouraging work, extending unemployment insurance would encourage people to look for jobs longer than they would have otherwise.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while Paul is wrong on the effects of unemployment benefits, he might get his way on the policy. Yes, Democrats and Republicans?led by Senator Patty Murray and Rep. Paul Ryan, respectively?are negotiating a budget agreement, and yes, Democrats want to extend unemployment insurance for the next year. But conservative Republicans <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/12/10/the_fools_are_at_it_again_conservatives_inane_new_budget_strategy/" type="external">refuse to budge</a> from the current spending levels, and right-wing groups like Heritage Action and FreedomWorks have already announced their opposition to a deal that raises spending. ?It?s disingenuous for Republicans to surrender the only real spending reforms accomplished under the Obama Administration, and call that a deal," FreedomWorks President Matt Kibbe said in a <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/freedomworks-key-votes-against-emerging-ryan-murray-budget-deal" type="external">statement</a>. And <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/12/09/morning-plum-sequester-will-be-lifted-but-unemployed-likely-to-be-left-behind/" type="external">according</a> to Greg Sargent at the Washington Post, senior Democrats are willing to support a deal that doesn?t include an extension of benefits:</p>
<p>?Of course we?d want to have the extension in the budget deal,? the aide says. ?But we?re dealing with Paul Ryan here. We?ve negotiated with Ryan to increase spending for the next two years in exchange for savings over the next 10 years. Replacing as much of sequestration as possible will be far better for families and the economy than the alternative, another CR at sequester levels ? and we can?t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.?</p>
<p>It?s possible that Democrats could get an extension through Congress without tying it to a broader deal, but I wouldn?t hold my breath. Not only would the Senate have to break a likely Republican filibuster, but John Boehner would have to buck his conservative members and risk his standing. Either Congress extends unemployment insurance as part of the Murray-Ryan deal, or it doesn?t at all. And if it doesn?t, the economic costs are high: <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44929" type="external">According</a> to the Congressional Budget Office, we give up 200,000 jobs and a boost to GDP by rejecting an extension.</p>
<p>It?s fair to want a smaller federal budget, even if the difference is marginal. In this case, however, it?s not worth the price in economic growth. But if Republicans couldn?t see this in 2011 or 2012?when they demanded even larger spending cuts?I doubt they?ll see it now.</p></article>

En Nueva Jersey y California, altos funcionarios dem?cratas quieren permitir que la gente haga donaciones de bien p?blico al estado en lugar de pagar ciertos impuestos. En Connecticut y Nueva York, funcionarios est?n explorando un cambio de impuestos sobre la renta a impuestos sobre la n?mina. Unos pocos gobernadores han propuesto incluso por recortes de impuestos.</p>
<p>Las ideas abundan en momentos en que los legisladores estatales comienzan sus sesiones del 2018 y eval?an los defectos de la reforma republicana de impuestos que el presidente Donald Trump firm? el mes pasado. Legisladores y gobernadores en algunos estados est?n tratando de ver c?mo protegen a sus constituyentes.</p>
<p>La pol?tica federal implementa un laberinto de cambios. Recorta las tasas de impuestos y aumenta a casi el doble la deducci?n est?ndar. Pero tambi?n pone l?mites en ciertas deducciones populares y fija las exenciones personales en cero.</p>
<p>Para muchos estadounidenses, el resultado deber? ser obligaciones tributarias m?s bajas, al menos inicialmente. Se espera que quienes enfrenten cuentas mayores estar?n concentrados en algunos estados con impuestos altos.</p>
<p>Con los legisladores comenzando sus sesiones y los gobernadores redactando presupuestos estatales, la respuesta es una prioridad pol?tica. Las propuestas son atrevidas, aunque no detalladas.</p>
<p>Esta semana, el gobernador de Nueva York, Andrew Cuomo, us? su informe al estado para prometer una demanda contra el plan fiscal republicano que calific? de ?asalto? por el gobierno federal. Una demanda a?adir?a los impuestos a la creciente lista de pol?ticas de Trump que estados dem?cratas han demandado en las cortes.</p>
<p>Otros estados no se han comprometido a demandar, pero algunos l?deres han indicado que explorar?n la idea.</p>
<p>?Ciertamente no soy un abogado constitucional, pero la noci?n de que esto (la reforma) no es constitucional es algo que queremos explorar?, dijo Phil Murphy, el gobernador electo dem?crata de Nueva Jersey.</p>
<p>Funcionarios en California y Connecticut dijeron tambi?n esta semana que estaban ponderando opciones legales.</p>
<p>En estados de impuestos altos, los funcionarios se est?n concentrando en proteger a los contribuyentes del impacto de un nuevo l?mite de 10.000 d?lares a las deducciones por pagar impuestos estatales y locales. En California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Nueva Jersey y Nueva York, m?s de una tercera parte de los contribuyentes se acogen a la deducci?n en los impuestos federales. La deducci?n promedio en cada estado es de m?s de 15.000 d?lares.</p>

Eso les permitir?a pedir la deducci?n caritativa en los impuestos federales.</p>
<p>En Nueva Jersey, el gobernador electo Murphy anunci? un plan similar el viernes, pero dijo que los gobiernos locales pudieran implementarlo tambi?n y aplicarlo a los impuestos sobre la propiedad.</p>

<article id="0000062" published-at="2017-12-08" title="British Independent Film Awards Shine a Spotlight on Newcomers"><p>Among the front-runners in the race for the British Independent Film Awards are three films by first-time directors: <a href="http://variety.com/t/william-oldroyd/" type="external">William Oldroyd</a>?s ?Lady Macbeth,? <a href="http://variety.com/t/rungano-nyoni/" type="external">Rungano Nyoni</a>?s ?I Am Not a Witch,? and <a href="http://variety.com/t/francis-lee/" type="external">Francis Lee</a>?s ?God?s Own Country.? This reflects the depth of new directing talent in Britain, and its diversity, with each helmer arriving at this point by different routes.</p>
<p>Oldroyd had served as a stage director for more than a decade, tackling contemporary adaptations of European classics, and had also directed two short films. ?Lady Macbeth? was also the debut feature for screenwriter Alice Birch, a rising British playwright, and producer Fodhla Cronin O?Reilly.</p>
<p>Producing a period film on a budget of ?500,000 ($667,000) was a challenge, Oldroyd says, and the decision to limit themselves to one location, Lambton Castle in Northern England, helped them stay within that.</p>
<p>Oldroyd sought two conditions in particular. ?Coming from theater I was very aware that there were certain things I wanted to carry across to give stability and certainty: one was rehearsal time [he had 10 days of rehearsals with the key cast at the location] and the other was to shoot in chronological order.?</p>
<p>He sought out the assistance of a storyboard artist in order to focus on shot selection. ?What I had to learn was where to put the camera, because I?m so used to watching a scene play out from one point of view on stage,? he says.</p>
<p>Oldroyd surrounded himself with experienced behind-the-camera talent, such as first assistant director George Every, who has 20 years? film experience, including time on Merchant Ivory movies. ?That was fantastic [to have] somebody who absolutely could tell me how a film would work, how it can be structured, and how we could shoot it in the time we had,? Oldroyd says.</p>
<p>Nyoni had shot a series of shorts, including the BAFTA-nominated ?Mwansa the Great,? before developing her Zambia-set script for ?I Am Not a Witch? through Cannes? Cinefondation residency. As part of her preparation for her feature, which was produced by Juliette Grandmont and feature debutante Emily Morgan, she read a lot of accounts of other directors? first-time experiences, including Paul Thomas Anderson on ?Hard Eight.?</p>
<p>?It sounded really harrowing,? she says. She also spoke to other directors about their debuts and found that ?everyone had a hard time.?</p>
<p>She sought to avoid common errors, such as running out of shooting time. When pre-production proved difficult, she sat down with cinematographer David Gallego and cut about 20 pages from the script to ?make our lives a little bit easier.? Their relationship was key. ?Thank god he was on the same page as me because if you get a cinematographer who?s more experienced than you and better known, if they decide to be the boss of your production you are screwed as a director,? she says.</p>
<p>Like Nyoni, Lee is self-taught as a writer-director, although he has many years? experience as an actor. He wrote the script for ?God?s Own Country? on spec, without having a producer attached. ?The whole experience was a huge learning curve. Making your first film is a big battle,? he says. ?The biggest influence on me was the idea of trusting your instinct, and being very clear about the kind of film you wanted to make.?</p>
<p>When choosing his film?s heads of department he was guided by the kinds of films they?d worked on before, such as with cinematographer Joshua James Richards, whose credits included ?Songs My Brothers Taught Me.? ?I absolutely fell in love with the way he depicted landscape and characters, and that felt very akin to how I saw [my film],? Lee says.</p>
<p>His primary concern was the actors, and those who would be closest to them on set. ?I wanted to shoot this film very intimately with the actors, and there were going to be some difficult things for them to do,? he says. ?It was super-important that [the DP and boom operator] could be supportive, sympathetic and build a bond with the actors.?</p>
<p>His own experience as an actor informed his approach on the film, which is about the love between an English sheep farmer and a Romanian farm worker. ?Having stood in front of the camera and knowing how vulnerable you feel, and how difficult it can be to deliver an emotional truth, it was my mission to make the actors feel secure, and that my focus would always be on them,? he says.</p></article>
<article id="0000063" published-at="2012-10-15" title="Gays Are ?Doing To Christians? What ?Nazis Used To Do To Jews? Says LaBarbera"><p><a href="" type="internal">Peter LaBarbera</a> is claiming that gays, or, as he calls them, ?homosexual activists,? are are ?doing to Christians? what the ?Nazis used to do to the Jews.? LaBarbera, head of the <a href="http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/anti-gay/active_hate_groups" type="external">certified anti-gay hate group</a>, <a href="" type="internal">Americans For Truth About Homosexuality</a>(AFTAH), was speaking with <a href="" type="internal">Judith Reisman</a>, of Jerry Falwell?s&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">Liberty University</a>. <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/labarbera-homosexual-activists-doing-to-christians-what-nazis-used-used-to-do-to-jews" type="external">Right Wing Watch</a>, which has the audio of this conversation, calls Reisman ?Liberty University?s&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/20744/her_kinsey_obsession" type="external">resident junk scientist</a>.?</p>
<p>?Homosexual activists in many ways drive our culture, they decide what?s going to be in a movie, we see all the portrayals, homosexuals are the most positively portrayed in the movies and on TV, Christians are often negatively portrayed and stereotyped,? LaBarbera claims in his conversation with Reisman. ?In many ways, in fact Judith you are Jewish, I think you?re starting to see Hollywood what they?re doing to Christians and to people of faith who actually adhere to traditional values, they?re demonizing them like the Nazis used to do to the Jews. They would compare Jews to rats and we see these vicious, ugly caricatures of Christians coming out of Hollywood. How did we go from that in such a short amount of time to homosexuality being deviant conduct which wasn?t spoken about to now driving our culture??</p>
<p>Brian Tashman at <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/labarbera-homosexual-activists-doing-to-christians-what-nazis-used-used-to-do-to-jews" type="external">Right Wing Watch</a> notes ?while the two anti-gay activists in their last interview&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/labarbera-gays-muslims-power-oppressing-freedom" type="external">likened gays to Soviet spies and radical Islamists</a>, LaBarbera and Reisman went straight to the Nazi comparisons this time.? Tashman adds:</p>
<p>Reisman eagerly agreed and likened public education in the US to schools in Hitler?s Germany and said that just as Nazis put up Hitler posters instead of the Ten Commandments, ?here in the United States we removed the Ten Commandments but we didn?t put up Hitler we put up the AIDS posters, which is just as telling, isn?t it??</p>
<p>For the record, the Nazis systematically murdered ? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust" type="external">between 11 million and 17 million people</a>,? including Jewish people, gay people,&amp;#160;Polish&amp;#160;and&amp;#160;Soviet&amp;#160;civilians,&amp;#160;Romani,&amp;#160;communists, and&amp;#160;Soviet prisoners of war, among many others.</p>

<article id="0000064" title="The rocking chairs"><p>Heritage column for Nov. 25</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the great division of things that follows the closing of a family home, the rocking chairs were not the kind of pieces over which there would have been a tug of war. They were not particularly attractive. They would not have much monetary value. They do not match with the d?cor.</p>
<p>But the two old rockers offered something that no new pieces of furniture could match, no amount of money could buy and no home should be without. They represented memories and I claimed the rockers and the memories.</p>
<p>My earliest memories center on those two rocking chairs that occupied prominent spaces in my grandparents' home. They always were in the dining room. Actually the dining room was a dining and sitting room because it was the only room in the house which was heated in the winter. Instead of some comfortable easy chair, my grandfather had a large oak rocker with a wooden back and leather seat. Instead of some comfy and cozy upholstered chair, my grandmother had a small cherry rocker with a cane bottom. I hardly can pass the two chairs, now in my home, without imagining the persons with whom they were so long associated.</p>
<p>Papa's big rocking chair was where he sat to read the newspaper and the Saturday Evening Post. He was one of the first persons in town to own a radio and the young people on the block would gather around the chair to hear broadcasts. He was one of the last persons to own a television; but when he finally surrendered, he sat in the chair to watch the comedies and Westerns that filled the airwaves of the early '60s.</p>
<p>Papa's rocking chair was a favorite place for his grandchildren. We would sit there in his lap. When he was not around, we would rock each other so furiously that it would be a constant source of frustration for the other adults who worried that we would break the rockers or break the head of the one taking the wild ride. Indeed the rockers are so worn and flat that the chair barely deserves the description of a rocker.</p>
<p>Grandma's rocker was a good size for a child and we usually could occupy it because she was too busy to sit for very long. Sometimes she sat there with some sewing in her lap. She sat and read her Sunday school lesson. She paused to enjoy some favorite soap operas: ?Our Gal Sunday,? ?Young Doctor Malone,? ?As the World Turns.?</p>
<p>I remember the night that my grandfather died. It all happened in a brief time and I still remember wondering how death had slipped into our home without advance notice. The next evening when we returned after the viewing at the funeral home, I broke down when I saw the empty chair and recognized clearly that everything had changed. It shocks me to realize that 42 years have passed since that night.</p>
<p>My grandmother lived for another 10 years. She wrote me several times a week throughout my college days and in my first year of teaching. The letters always closed with ?I love you, Grandma.? She lived to hold her first great-grandchild, our son Chris.</p>
<p>On this very day, November 25th, in 1972, now 32 years ago, she died-full of years and held in respect by all that knew her.</p>
<p>No words of tribute could ever be adequate to describe the blessing that my grandparents were to my life. They loved me before I was born. They nurtured me through my childhood. They wiped away tears, shared laughs and brought glasses of water in the night. They hired taxicabs to take me to the fairgrounds. They walked with me to the park. My grandfather walked with me down the church aisle when I joined the church; and much to everyone's amazement, he joined too. That very morning we were baptized together.</p>
<p>They never gave a second thought when we three children came to live with them following our parents' divorce. It was not until I was grown that I realized the disruption of their lives and the financial sacrifice that our presence must have required.</p>
<p>Something else happened on this very day, November 25th, in 1972. Just hours after my grandmother died, our son, Matthew, was born. Now he is grown and a father himself. Now I am the grandparent who sits in the rocking chair with a grandchild on my lap. The years move along and the old rocking chairs remain. And so do the memories on this Thanksgiving Day.</p>

<article id="0000065" published-at="2017-08-29" title="Second Holiest City In Judaism Finally Gets Designation As Jewish Settlement"><p>Jews in the ancient Biblical city of Hebron, the second holiest city in Judaism and the city where King David was anointed king, got <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Israel-declares-Hebron-an-official-Jewish-settlement-503705" type="external">great news</a> on Friday: Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman made an upgrade that gave them separate powers from the Palestinian Municipality that governs Hebron. Roughly 1,000 Jews live in Hebron, the site of the Cave of Machpelah where the ancient ancestors of the Jewish people, Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebecca, Jacob, and Leah are buried. The Bible states in Genesis that Abraham (Abram) ?dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron? where ?he built an altar to the Lord.?</p>
<p>Hebron was the site of the 1929 massacre, in which Arabs slaughtered 67 Jews while the British looked the other way. As Bernard Wasserstein quoted in The British in Palestine: The Mandatory Government and the Arab-Jewish Conflict 1917-1929, one survivor reported, ?On hearing screams in a room I went up a sort of tunnel passage and saw an Arab in the act of cutting off a child?s head with a sword.? In May 1980, six yeshiva students <a href="http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=7&amp;amp;x_issue=75&amp;amp;x_article=3670" type="external">were killed</a> and 20 wounded by Palestinian terrorists as they returned from prayers at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron; in 1983, another yeshiva student was gunned down in the center of Hebron.</p>
<p>As recently as the end of June, a Palestinian gunman <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Palestinian-gunman-opens-fire-on-Israeli-troops-in-Hebron-is-shot-dead-498242" type="external">opened fire</a> on Israeli troops as they attempted to uncover an arms cache in Hebron. He was shot and killed. In August, Israeli troops <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/in-hebron-troops-arrest-parents-who-stashed-bullets-in-kids-rooms/" type="external">arrested</a> a Palestinian couple in Hebron who had hidden over 200 rounds of ammunition in their children?s bedrooms.</p>
<p>Tayseer Abu Sneineh was elected mayor of Hebron in 2017; he was one of four Palestinian terrorists who on May 2, 1980 <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinian-terrorist-in-killing-of-6-jews-elected-hebron-mayor/" type="external">attacked a group of Israelis and Jews</a> in a Hebron alley with grenades, killing U.S. citizens Tzvi Glatt and Eli HaZe?ev, Canadian Shmuel Marmelstein and Israelis Hanan Krauthammer, Gershon Klein and Ya?akov Zimmerman. Another 20 people were injured.</p>
<p>In 1997 the city was officially split between the Arabs and the Jews; 220,000 Palestinians now live there, with <a href="http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Hebron-The-conflict-in-a-nutshell-490446" type="external">barbed wire</a> that surrounds Jewish buildings and the 12 IDF checkpoints.</p>
<p>The new upgrade allows the Jews to independently seek services from the Civil Administration. Deputy Defense Minister Eli Dahan (Bayit Yehudi) said, ?For years, Hebron?s Jewish residents lived without a municipal authority to take care of all the services required for normative civilian life.? He added, ?After the election of a murderer for mayor of Hebron, the idea that they will receive these services from the municipality has become even more absurd. This is another important step in normalizing the lives of the Jews in Hebron in particular and in all of Judea and Samaria in general.?</p></article>

<article id="0000072" published-at="2018-01-21" title="Montecito Mudslides Leave Debris, Destruction and Traumatized Residents"><p>Tonight is a big night in Santa Barbara County California. &amp;#160;For the first time since January 9th, Highway 101 is open. &amp;#160;It?s taken workers nearly two weeks to clear the rivers of mud and debris from the freeway. &amp;#160;</p>
<p>The residents of Santa Barbara County have been through hell. &amp;#160;First, it was the Thomas fire back in December. &amp;#160;Then it was a wall of water and mud that came down the mountain, washing away parts of Montecito earlier this month. &amp;#160;20 people died. &amp;#160;It will take months for the area to return to anything resembling normal. &amp;#160;We spoke to two families who lived through it all. &amp;#160;This is their story.</p>
<p>????</p>
<p>On the night a wall of mud and ash descended on their quiet neighborhood, Bill Ekeler?s wife, Heather, shook him awake with a start.&amp;#160; ?Bill, there?s something strange?the skylight is orange,? she told him. So the father of three went down to the kitchen to get a better look. There, he saw a ?massive orange glow? coming from the low hills to the north and east.</p>
<p>Worried for the safety of his wife and kids, as well as the well-being of his in-laws and their two children who had been evacuated the day before and were asleep in the basement,&amp;#160;Ekeler jumped in his son?s car and drove in the direction of the glow.</p>
<p>The rain was pouring hard, and Ekeler heard a strange roar?what sounded like a jet engine. &amp;#160;He soon realized the fire was the least of his worries. ?Right in front of me there was a wall of 6 or 8 feet of water and the fastest growing river that you?ve ever seen,? Ekeler says. He didn?t waste any time getting back to his home.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>In the week that has passed since the worst mudslides in 20 years enveloped this otherwise picturesque community, shellshocked families like the Ekelers are doing their best to cope with the trauma of that night and its aftermath?both mindful and fearful of the fact that another heavy rain could cause yet more damage.</p>
<p>It was just last month when a fire created the conditions for all this mud. &amp;#160;It was called the Thomas fire and it burned nearly 300,000 acres across southern California. &amp;#160;The hills around Montecito was ground zero for the fire. &amp;#160;Vegetation was incinerated for miles.</p>
<p>But by New Year?s Eve, thinking the worst was finally behind them, Montecito residents were able to settle back in. &amp;#160; The fires were under control. &amp;#160;A voluntary evacuation alert was issued when the rain started falling, but most residents stayed put. Having survived the fires, they could not imagine what was about to come.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, state and local officials are scrambling to clear debris.&amp;#160;Cable and gas companies are working around the clock to restore service to thousands of customers. Emergency water distribution sites have been set up. A fleet of bulldozers and dump trucks have been deployed to clear an impassable stretch of Highway 101 though officials caution the crucial freeway will&amp;#160;remain closed ?indefinitely.?&amp;#160; By the last count, 120 homes have been lost and 20 people have died. Three are still missing.</p>
<p>Down Olive Mill Road, the Ekelers? friend Susan Moe woke up that night to the same roaring noise and livid sky. From her window, she watched as both her front yard and her backyard were inundated with mud and water. ?We were completely&amp;#160;trapped,? she says. ?It was just a wall of water and trees and cars and debris and things that were flowing down.?</p>
<p>Moe spent the next few hours anxiously texting and waiting with the Ekelers and other friends. The storm intensified around 3:30 a.m., as Montecito was battered by more than a half-inch of rain in five minutes, sending boulders and mud shooting down the canyons. The rain didn?t ease up until&amp;#160;daybreak when the Moes were rescued by firefighters.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Surveying the destruction, they soon realized that the wall separating their property from their neighbor?s had, in fact, saved their lives. ?These trees and cars were stopped by that wall and that prevented them from coming into our bedroom windows,? she says. ?It makes me shake just thinking about it.?</p>
<p>As the day went on, neighbors picked through the rubble and joined impromptu search parties looking for missing residents.&amp;#160;A mother and one of her daughters were found, but a second daughter and stepdaughter remained unaccounted for. Even these modest efforts were quickly hampered by adverse conditions, however, and the sheriff soon asked volunteers to let the professionals take over. ?The mud itself was so thick, it was almost the consistency of Cream of Wheat,? Ekeler says, ?Almost like quicksand.?</p>
<p>The bodies of the two girls were later recovered.</p>
<p>With no access to cable TV or the Internet for news, residents relied on word of mouth to learn about the fate of their neighbors. Ekeler soon learned that Connor McManigal, 23, had been swept into the storm along with his father John, 61. ?Connor ended up almost a mile down in the 101 with broken ribs,? says Ekeler. His father did not survive. ?It?s stuff like that,? Ekeler says. ?When you see that people traveled that far and survived, and some didn?t.? Ekeler later went to check on the McManigals? home to see if he could find their cat for Connor, who is recovering in a local hospital. What he found shocked him anew.&amp;#160;?When I got up to where his house was,? Ekeler says, ?the house wasn?t there.?</p>
<p>Harder still is explaining to his three kids that some of their school friends and classmates? parents were lost in a tragic instant. ?It?s been very, very traumatic for him,? says Ekeler of son Blake, 13, with whom he watched the National Championship college football game only hours before all hell broke loose. ?He doesn?t really understand it and, as a parent, you really don?t know what to say.?</p>

<p>Europe will see 45 stores closed while the US stores will see total square footage reduced by 15 percent.</p>
<p>The move is part of a restructuring in which the office supply giant likely hopes to sell off its European printing business while strengthening its online presence.</p>
<p>Office supply retailers like Staples have been badly bruised in the recession during which business customers declined.</p>
<p>They have also had to face growing competition from online retailers like Amazon, while dealing with an increasingly paper-less world, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2012/09/25/staples-plans-restructuring-and-store-closings-but-no-word-of-sale/" type="external">said the Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>

<p>Matthews: By the way, working at Fox has kind of turned out to be kind of the roach motel. I mean anybody who?s going over there to work seems like they?re getting the sticky stuff on the floor over there. They haven?t been able to come back.</p>
<p>Any real or perceived implosion by prospective Republican candidates as a result of their appearances on Fox would be of their own doing and has nothing to do with being associated with Fox.

<p>International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said on Thursday she believes the IMF can work successfully with the Trump administration to improve the global trading system, but added that open trade must be preserved as a growth engine.</p>

<p>Lagarde told a news conference at the opening of the IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington that the IMF saw the need to reduce subsidies and other trade distortions that limit competition, but also said "protectionist measures" needed to be avoided.</p>
<p>"From the various contacts that I've had with the administration so far, I have every reason to believe that we will make progress, that we will cooperate all together in order to support and indeed improve the system as we have it," Lagarde said.

<article id="0000084" published-at="2014-01-15" title="Poll: Christie Cruising Through Bridge Scandal (So Far)"><p>Nearly 70 percent of Americans say the bridge-closure scandal engulfing Chris Christie has not changed their opinion about the New Jersey governor, according to a new NBC News/Marist poll. In addition, 44 percent of respondents believe he?s telling the truth about his knowledge of the events surrounding the controversy.</p>
<p>And far more Americans view him as a strong leader rather than as a bully.</p>
<p>But the survey also shows that the potential 2016 Republican candidate has lost ground to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in an early hypothetical presidential match up and now trails her by 13 points.</p>
<p>Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, explains that, overall, this is good news for Christie.</p>
<p>?The numbers suggest it?s far from politically fatal for him,? he says of the scandal, adding: ?This is a developing story, so the extent of the damage down the road is an open proposition.?</p>
<p>But the down side for Christie, according to Miringoff: Americans ?are getting to know to him, and that?s maybe not the best way to introduce himself to a national audience.?</p>
<p>The poll ? conducted Jan. 12-14 ? comes after <a href="" type="internal">released emails</a> showing that a top Christie aide, as well as his Port Authority appointees, conspired to close local-access lanes to the busy George Washington Bridge as retribution against the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, N.J.</p>
<p>?Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,? Christie Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Anne Kelly emailed Christie Port Authority aide David Wildstein back in Aug. 2013, just weeks before the lane closures.</p>
<p>?Got it,? Wildstein replied.</p>
<p>In a subsequent news conference last Thursday, Christie announced that he had fired Kelly, but also said that he had no knowledge of or role in the lane closings.</p>
<p>Most haven?t changed their opinion of Christie</p>
<p>According to the survey, 18 percent of American adults say the scandal makes them like Christie less, compared with 5 percent who say it makes them like him more.</p>
<p>But a whopping 69 percent say it hasn?t changed their opinion of the New Jersey governor.</p>
<p>Still, a combined 71 percent of respondents say they know either ?a lot? or ?some? about the story.</p>
<p>In addition, a plurality ? 44 percent ? believe Christie is mostly telling the truth, 33 percent say he?s not and another 23 percent are unsure.</p>
<p><a href="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/Sections/A_Politics/_Today_Stories_Teases/ChristiePoll.pdf" type="external">Read the full poll</a></p>
<p>(There?s a political divide to these responses, however: 61 percent of Republicans say he?s telling the truth, while 41 percent of Democrat don?t think he is.)</p>
<p>And more respondents view him as a strong leader (47 percent) than as a bully (27 percent).</p>
<p>Christie trails Clinton in a national match up</p>
<p>Despite those numbers, Christie has lost ground to Hillary Clinton in an early hypothetical presidential match up. In this current poll, he trails Clinton by 13 points, 50 percent to 37 percent among nationwide voters.</p>
<p>But in the same poll a month ago, Clinton?s lead was a mere three points, 48 percent to 45 percent.</p>
<p>?Up against a likely Hillary candidacy, the argument that Christie is positioned to win back the White House [for Republicans] is far from automatic,? Miringoff says.</p>
<p>What?s also problematic for Christie is that his favorability rating is upside down ? with 28 percent viewing him positively and 30 percent viewing him negatively.</p>
<p>By comparison, Clinton?s fav/unfav rating is a net positive (50 percent positive, 38 percent negative), while President Barack Obama?s is a net negative (41 percent to 48 percent).</p>
<p>Measuring the GOP?s 2016 field</p>
<p>That said, Christie is leading the pack ? barely ? in an early trial heat of potential Republican candidates.</p>
<p>When Republicans voters were asked whom they support if the GOP primary or caucus were held today, 16 percent picked Christie, 12 percent sided with 2012 running mate Paul Ryan, 9 percent said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and 8 percent said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.</p>
<p>Those percentages are virtually unchanged from last month.</p>
<p>Rounding out the rest of the field: Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., (7 percent); Texas Gov. Rick Perry (6 percent); former presidential candidate Rick Santorum (5 percent); Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, (5 percent); Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (4 percent); and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (3 percent).</p>
<p>Still, 25 percent said they were undecided.</p>
<p>?It?s about as wide open as it can get,? Miringoff says.</p>
<p>The NBC/Marist poll was conducted Jan. 12-14 of 1,200 national adults (margin of error of plus-minus 2.8 percentage points), 1,039 registered voters (plus-minus 3.0 percentage points) and 385 Republican voters (plus-minus 5.0 percentage points).</p></article>

<p>When human injury results in coma, a victim is assessed on the Glasgow Coma Scale.&amp;#160; Eye function, and sound and motion capability, indicate if death is imminent or not.</p>
<p>Empires? ends are unpredictable, but three criteria seem determinant: military overreach, state insolvency, and economic inequity.</p>
<p>Our overreach is obvious, ridiculous, and inalterable: our criminal economy demands it.&amp;#160; America attacks, invades, and destroys so our murderous war machine can engorge itself on wealth extracted from our own blood and marrow.</p>
<p>Our State?absolutely insolvent, existing on loans?runs a giant shell game using keystroke fiat money on nations so gigantically bankrupt, so utterly captive, that they have to accept the wildly bogus dollar?s value or crash and burn.</p>
<p>Economic inequity is at a level unmatched in any empire since Ninevah and all financial levers work to increase it.</p>
<p>So then, for America, is it all over but the shouting?</p>
<p>Or can this absurdly precarious condition continue?&amp;#160; It probably can, until a Black Swan event roars out of the dark and sweeps the whole moribund structure away.</p>
<p>So, a clumsily provoked war, perhaps, against a real adversary, not one of the tiny, poor, primitive ?enemies? that routinely stalemate our glitzy war machine.&amp;#160; Or a category 5 typhoon of 200 trillion in derivatives that blows Wall Street?s house down?&amp;#160; A ?people?s revolution?..?&amp;#160; Nah.</p>
<p>The unique feature of our Empire may be the stunning contrast between its ponderous material might and the imbecility of its human owners.&amp;#160; Wherever one looks in the stratosphere of American authority, instead of wisdom and probity there is rabid vacuity or what-me-worry bufoonery.</p>
<p>Our President is the incarnation of infantile autism.&amp;#160; His Braindead Trust of dotty warlords are brass boobs with the intellectual acuity of ventriloquists? dummies.&amp;#160; His cabinet is a looney gaggle of retro clowns and Snerd goofuses, embarrassing even to that stumblebum Congress of sociopathic criminals and defectives that confirmed them.</p>
<p>And the Goldberg Machine of US Empire churns on.&amp;#160; And so it goes, as Vonnegut said.&amp;#160; In his view humans were put on earth to fart around, and this seems certain in our case.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175603/" type="external">story</a> first appeared on the <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/" type="external">TomDispatch</a> website.</p>
<p>We had a debate club back in high school. Two teams would meet in the auditorium, and Mr. Garrity would tell us the topic, something 1970s-ish like ?Resolved: Women Should Get Equal Pay for Equal Work? or ?World Communism Will Be Defeated in Vietnam.? Each side would then try, through persuasion and the marshalling of facts, to clinch the argument. There?d be judges and a winner.</p>
<p>Today?s presidential debates are a long way from Mr. Garrity?s club. It seems that the first rule of the debate club now is: no disagreeing on what matters most. In fact, the two candidates rarely interact with each other at all, typically ditching whatever the question might be for some rehashed set of campaign talking points, all with the complicity of the celebrity media moderators preening about democracy in action. Waiting for another quip about Big Bird is about all the content we can expect.</p>
<p>But the joke is on us. Sadly, the two candidates are stand-ins for Washington in general, a ?war? capital whose denizens work and argue, sometimes fiercely, from within a remarkably limited range of options. It was D.C. on autopilot last week for domestic issues; the next two presidential debates are to be in part or fully on foreign policy challenges (of which there are so many). When it comes to foreign?that is, military?policy, the gap between Barack and Mitt is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/us/politics/obama-and-romney-strain-to-assert-foreign-policy-differences.html" type="external">slim</a> to the point of nonexistent on many issues, however much they may badger each other on the subject. That old saw about those who fail to understand history repeating its mistakes applies a little too easily here: the last 11 years have added up to one disaster after another abroad, and without a smidgen of new thinking (guaranteed not to put in an appearance at any of the debates to come), we doom ourselves to more of the same.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com" type="external"></a></p>
<p>So in honor of old Mr. Garrity, here are five critical questions that should be explored (even if all of us know that they won?t be) in the foreign policy-inclusive presidential debates scheduled <a href="http://www.2012presidentialelectionnews.com/2012-debate-schedule/2012-presidential-debate-schedule/%20O" type="external">for</a> October 16th, and 22nd?with a sixth bonus question thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>1. Is there an end game for the global war on terror?</p>
<p>The current president, elected on the promise of change, altered very little when it came to George W. Bush?s Global War on Terror (other than dropping the name). That jewel-in-the-crown of Bush-era offshore imprisonment, Guantanamo, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/30/world/americas/canadian-held-at-guantanamo-bay-is-repatriated.html" type="external">still houses</a> over 160 prisoners held without trial or hope or a plan for what to do with them. While the US pulled its troops <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-us-withdrawal-from-iraq-marks-the-end-of-american-supremacy/2011/12/12/gIQAStpTyO_story.html" type="external">out of Iraq</a>?mostly because our Iraqi ?allies? flexed their muscles a bit and <a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/09/10/why_mitt_romney_cant_talk_about_iraq" type="external">threw</a> us out?the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/30/2000-us-troop-killed-afghanistan-insider-attack_n_1926536.html" type="external">war in Afghanistan</a> stumbles on. Drone strikes and other forms of conflict continue in the same places Bush tormented: <a href="http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/09/yemen-drone-war/" type="external">Yemen</a>, <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/06/27/somalia-s-prisons-the-war-on-terror-s-latest-front.html" type="external">Somalia</a>, and <a href="http://www.longwarjournal.org/pakistan-strikes.php" type="external">Pakistan</a> (and it?s clear that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/white-house-secret-meetings-examine-al-qaeda-threat-in-north-africa/2012/10/01/f485b9d2-0bdc-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_story.html?socialreader_check=0&amp;amp;amp;denied=1" type="external">northern Mali</a> is heading our way).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0805096817/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20" type="external"></a>A huge national security state has been codified in a host of new or expanded intelligence agencies under the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/dhs-fusion-centers-portrayed-as-pools-of-ineptitude-and-civil-liberties-intrusions/2012/10/02/10014440-0cb1-11e2-bd1a-b868e65d57eb_story.html" type="external">Homeland Security</a> umbrella, and Washington seems able to come up with nothing more than a whack-a-mole strategy for ridding itself of the scourge of terror, an endless succession of killings of ?al-Qaeda Number 3? guys. <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/05/22/john_brennans_new_power/" type="external">Counterterrorism tsar</a> John Brennan, Obama?s drone-meister, has put it <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/09/18/the_seven_deadly_sins_of_john_brennan?page=full" type="external">this way</a>: ?We?re not going to rest until al-Qaeda the organization is destroyed and is eliminated from areas in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Africa, and other areas.?</p>
<p>So, candidates, the question is: What?s the end game for all this? Even in the worst days of the Cold War, when it seemed impossible to imagine, there was still a goal: the ?end? of the Soviet Union. Are we really consigned to the Global War on Terror, under whatever name or no name at all, as an infinite state of existence? Is it now as American as apple pie?</p>
<p>2. Do today?s foreign policy challenges mean that it?s time to retire the Constitution?</p>
<p>A domestic policy crossover question here. Prior to September 11, 2001, it was generally assumed that our amazing Constitution could be adapted to whatever challenges or problems arose. After all, that founding document expanded to end the slavery it had once supported, weathered trials and misuses as dumb as Prohibition and as grave as <a href="http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/saccov/redscare.html" type="external">Red Scares</a>, Palmer Raids, and <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/us/53a.asp" type="external">McCarthyism</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" type="external">First Amendment</a> grew to cover comic books, nude art works, and a million electronic forms of expression never imagined in the eighteenth century. Starting on September 12, 2001, however, challenges, threats, and risks abroad have been used to justify abandoning core beliefs enshrined in the Bill of Rights. That bill, we are told, can?t accommodate terror threats to the Homeland. Absent the third rail of the <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment02/" type="external">Second Amendment</a> and gun ownership (politicians touch it and die), nearly every other key amendment has since been trodden upon.</p>
<p>The First Amendment was sacrificed to silence <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/archive/175526/peter_van_buren_the_whistleblower's_piece" type="external">whistleblowers</a> and <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/06/23/risen_3/" type="external">journalists</a>. The <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/09/14/warantless_wiretapping_bill_james_clapper_despite_schakowsky_efforts_house_votes_to_renew_fisa_provisions_.html" type="external">Fourth</a> and <a href="http://investorplace.com/investorpolitics/what-obama-slipped-by-us-on-new-years-eve/" type="external">Fifth</a> Amendments were ignored to spy on Americans at home and kill them with drones abroad. (September 30th was the one-year anniversary of the Obama administration?s first <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/09/30/us-born-terror-boss-anwar-al-awlaki-killed/" type="external">acknowledged murder</a> without due process of an American?and later his teenaged son?abroad. The US has <a href="http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/09/18/the_seven_deadly_sins_of_john_brennan?page=full" type="external">similarly killed</a> two other Americans abroad via drone, albeit ?by accident.?)</p>
<p>So, candidates, the question is: Have we walked away from the Constitution? If so, shouldn?t we publish some sort of notice or bulletin?</p>
<p>3. What do we want from the Middle East?</p>
<p>Is it all about oil? Israel? Old-fashioned hegemony and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/25/us-un-assembly-obama-excerpts-idUSBRE88O0F520120925" type="external">containment</a>? What is our goal in fighting an intensifying <a href="http://wemeantwell.com/blog/2011/04/18/proxy-war-us-v-iran-in-the-middle-east/" type="external">proxy war</a> with Iran, newly expanded into <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/01/world/middleeast/obama-ordered-wave-of-cyberattacks-against-iran.html" type="external">cyberspace</a>? Are we worried about a nuclear Iran, or just worried about a new nuclear club member in general? Will we continue the nineteenth century game of supporting thug dictators who support our policies in <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175594/marlowe_terror_and_tear_gas" type="external">Bahrain</a>, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Libya (until overwhelmed by events on the ground), and opposing the same actions by other thugs who disagree with us like Iraq?s Saddam Hussein and Syria?s Bashar al-Assad? That kind of <a href="http://wais.stanford.edu/USA/us_supportforladictators8303.html" type="external">policy thinking</a> did not work out too well in the long run in Central and South America, and history suggests that we should make up our mind on what America?s goals in the Middle East might actually be. No cheating now?having <a href="http://world.time.com/2012/10/01/after-november-five-mideast-headaches-looming-for-the-u-s/" type="external">no policy</a> is a policy of its own.</p>
<p>Candidates, can you define America?s predominant interest in the Middle East and sketch out a series of at least semi-sensical actions in support of it?</p>
<p>4. What is your plan to right-size our military and what about downsizing the global mission?</p>
<p>The decade?and counting?of grinding war in Iraq and Afghanistan has worn the American military down to its lowest point since <a href="http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=1020" type="external">Vietnam</a>. Though drugs and poor discipline are not tearing out its heart as they did in the 1970s, <a href="http://nation.time.com/2012/08/16/grim-record-soldier-suicides-reach-new-high/" type="external">suicide</a> among soldiers now takes that first chair position. The toll on families of endless deployments is hard to measure but easy to see. The expanding role of the military abroad (reconstruction, peacekeeping, disaster relief, garrisoning a long <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/archive/175338/" type="external">necklace of bases</a> from Rota, Spain, to Kadena, Okinawa) seems to require a vast standing army. At the same time, the dramatic increase in the development and use of a new praetorian guard, <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/archive/175426/nick_turse_a_secret_war_in_120_countries" type="external">Joint Special Operations Command</a>, coupled with a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/petraeus-would-helm-an-increasingly-militarized-cia/2011/04/27/AFwoDM1E_story.html" type="external">militarized CIA</a> and its <a href="http://hnn.us/articles/our-drone-planet-interview-tom-engelhardt-and-nick-turse-past-present-and-future-drones" type="external">drones</a>, have given the president previously unheard of <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/archive/175551/assassin-in-chief" type="external">personal killing power</a>. Indeed, Obama has underscored his unchecked solo role as the ?decider? on exactly who gets <a href="http://news.antiwar.com/2012/05/29/officials-confirm-obama-decides-who-lives-and-who-dies" type="external">obliterated</a> by drone assassins.</p>
<p>So, candidates, here?s a two-parter: Given that a huge Occupy Everywhere army is killing more of its own via suicide than any enemy, what will you do to right-size the military and downsize its global mission? Secondly, did this country?s founders really intend for the president to have unchecked personal war-making powers?</p>
<p>5. Since no one outside our borders buys American exceptionalism anymore, what?s next? What is America?s point these days?</p>
<p>The big one. We keep the old myth alive that America is a special, good place, the most ? <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/02/opinion/la-oe-engelhardt-american-exceptionalism-20111202" type="external">exceptional</a>? of places in fact, but in our foreign policy we?re more like some mean old man, reduced to feeling good about himself by yelling at the kids to get off the lawn (or simply taking potshots at them).</p>
<p>During the Cold War, the American <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2006/sep/10/post348" type="external">ideal</a> represented freedom to so many people, even if the reality was far more ambiguous. Now, who we are and what we are abroad seems so much grimmer, so much less appealing (as global opinion polls <a href="http://www.pewglobal.org/2012/09/19/wait-you-still-dont-like-us/" type="external">regularly indicate</a>). In light of the Iraq invasion and occupation, and the failure to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/25/us/politics/arab-spring-proves-a-harsh-test-for-obamas-diplomatic-skill.html" type="external">embrace</a> the Arab Spring, America the Exceptional, has, it seems, run its course.</p>
<p>America the Hegemonic, a tough if unattractive moniker, also seems a goner, given the <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175587/tomgram%3A_engelhardt,_losing_it_in_washington/" type="external">slo-mo defeat</a> in Afghanistan and the never-ending stalemate that is the Global War on Terror. Resource imperialist? America?s failure to either back away from the Greater Middle East and simply pay the price for oil, or successfully grab the oil, adds up to a ?policy? that only encourages ever more instability in the region. The saber rattling that goes with such a strategy (if it can be called that) feels angry, unproductive, and without any doubt unbelievably expensive.</p>
<p>So candidates, here are a few questions: Who exactly are we in the world and who do you want us to be? Are you ready to promote a policy of fighting to be planetary top dog?and we all know where that leads?or can we find a place in the global community? Without resorting to the usual ?shining city on a hill? metaphors, can you tell us your vision for America in the world? (Follow up: No really, cut the b.s and answer this one, gentlemen. It?s important!)</p>
<p>6. Bonus Question: To each of the questions above add this: How do you realistically plan to pay for it? For every school and road built in Iraq and Afghanistan on the taxpayer dollar, why didn?t you build two here in the United States? When you insist that we can?t pay for crucial needs at home, explain to us why these can be funded abroad. If your response is we had to spend that money to ?defend America,? tell us why building jobs in this country doesn?t do more to defend it than anything done abroad.</p>
<p>Now that might spark a real debate, one that?s long, long overdue.</p>
<p>Peter Van Buren, a 24-year veteran Foreign Service Officer at the State Department, spent a year in Iraq. Now in Washington and a <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175583/van_buren_imperial_reconstruction_and_its_discontents" type="external">TomDispatch regular</a>, he writes about Iraq, the Middle East, and US diplomacy at his blog, <a href="http://www.wemeantwell.com" type="external">We Meant Well</a>. Following the publication of his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0805096817/ref=nosim/?tag=tomdispatch-20" type="external">We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People</a> (the American Empire Project, Metropolitan Books), the Department of State began termination proceedings, stripping him of his security clearance and diplomatic credentials. Through the efforts of the <a href="http://www.whistleblower.org/" type="external">Government Accountability Project</a> and the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/" type="external">ACLU</a>, Van Buren instead retired from the State Department with his full benefits of service.

<article id="0000090" published-at="2013-08-13" title="John Lewis? Advice for Young Activists: March"><p>I jumped in the car with two of the young people, and I drove to Selma, late at night, got there at three or four in the morning, got our sleeping bags out, got up the next morning, got dressed, went to the church, and we lined up and we marched. The rest is history.</p>
<p>As the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom approaches, the spirit of protest seems to be rekindling in many parts of the country. The Dream Defenders remain camped out in the Florida capitol, demanding justice for Trayvon Martin and an end to racial profiling; North Carolina's <a href="" type="internal">Moral Monday protesters</a> have rallied and committed civil disobedience each week, defying the far-right agenda of their state legislators. In New York, the <a href="" type="internal">coalition against stop and frisk</a> won its victory in court, but it took organizing, rallying, and yes, marching, to make it happen.</p>
<p>It's a good time, then, for a new memoir by congressman and 1960s civil rights leader John Lewis. In March: Book One, out today from <a href="http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog/march/760" type="external">Top Shelf Productions</a>, Lewis' history and the highs and lows of the civil rights movement are brought to life?vividly, as the memoir is in comic format.</p>
<p>The first of three books follows a young Lewis from his family's farm in Alabama to college and to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), to lunch counter sit-ins, jail cells and a showdown with the mayor of Nashville. Co-written by Andrew Aydin, a staffer who's been with Lewis for years, and drawn by award-winning comics artist Nate Powell, the book makes history feel real and present in a way that few accounts of civil rights legends have managed to.</p>
<p>Lewis and Aydin sat down with me during a visit to New York to discuss the new comic, their goal of inspiring and instructing a new generation, and where they're finding hope these days.</p>
<p>Sarah Jaffe: This book is the first of three volumes, all with the title March. Why did you pick that title?</p>
<p>John Lewis: March is the spring, it's life, it's the beginning. So much happened in March. But it's also moving feet.</p>
<p>Andrew Aydin: There was a quote that stuck with us very early on, it was something Dr. King said: ?There's no sound more powerful than the marching feet of the determined people.?</p>
<p>But March is so many different things. It is the need to march. It is March 7, 1965. There's so much meaning behind it, it seemed almost self-evident.</p>
<p>Book 2 contains a very famous march. During the movement, the Congressman was so committed to action. There were so many moments where people wanted to talk, and he wanted to do. There's this scene in Book 2, when they're saying the violence is getting to be too much, we have to work out a solution, and they'd turn to John Lewis and say, ?What do you think we should do?? And he would say, ?We should just march.?</p>
<p>They would ask him again and he would say, ?We should just march.? Finally they say, ?John, everything you're saying is that we should march, but people are going to get hurt, people are going to get killed, it's your own foolish pride that's getting involved with that, you're just nothing but a sinner.?</p>
<p>And he's like, ?I may be a sinner, but we're gonna march.?</p>
<p>It so typifies his view on how to get things done. We can sit around and talk about it, we can make speeches, but really when it comes down to it, the hard part is doing the work. Taking action.</p>
<p>John Lewis: This may sound a little self-serving here, but my own organization, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, objected to the march in Selma. We had an all-night discussion, a debate whether we should march. It's clear to me that I should march. And I said, ?I've been to Selma many many times, I've stood in line at the courthouse, I've been arrested, I've been to jail there. The local people want to march, and I'm going to march.?</p>
<p>So I jumped in the car with two of the young people, and I drove to Selma, late at night, got there at three or four in the morning, got our sleeping bags out, got up the next morning, got dressed, went to the church, and we lined up and we marched. The rest is history.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just have to do what your spirit says do. Go for it.</p>
<p>Why did you decide to do this as a comic?&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Andrew Aydin: I was working for the Congressman on the 2008 campaign as his press secretary, and we started talking about what we were going to do after we had our nights and weekends back. I admitted I was going to a comic book convention?in politics that gets you laughs, snickers, a little jeering. But the Congressman said, ?You know, there was a comic book during the movement and it was incredibly influential.? That comic book was ? <a href="http://www.ep.tc/mlk/" type="external">Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story</a>.?</p>
<p>I went home that night, Googled it, and read the story about how it <a href="http://theubs.com/features/themontstory.php" type="external">inspired the Greensboro 4</a>. I came back the next day and asked him ?Why don't you write a comic book??&amp;#160;</p>
<p>The Congressman looked at me like I was crazy there for a second, but we talked about the comic from the '50s, and a couple weeks later I asked again, and the Congressman said, ?OK, but only if you write it with me.?</p>
<p>It just seemed to make sense, the idea of a comic book inspiring young people to get involved and also teaching them the tactics.</p>
<p>The book uses President Obama's inauguration as a framing device. Can you talk about the decision to do that?</p>
<p>John Lewis: People ask me from time to time whether the election of Barack Obama was the fulfillment of Martin Luther King's dream, and I say, ?No, it's just a down payment.?</p>
<p>Because we're not there. More and more, people are saying that we still have a distance to travel, and that we cannot be at peace or be at home with ourselves in America until we create a truly multiracial democratic society, where no one is left behind, and it doesn't matter whether you're black or white, Latino or Asian-American or Native America, whether you're straight or gay. . And there's a way to do it. If you want to change things, you got to find a way to make some noise. You cannot be quiet.</p>
<p>The lessons of March say, This is the way another generation did it, and you, too, can follow that path, studying the way of peace, love and nonviolence, and finding a way to get in the way. Finding a way to get in trouble?good trouble, necessary trouble.</p>
<p>The book relates some of the experiences you had as a young person that led you to civil rights activism. Most people probably wouldn't think of raising chickens as a thing that would shape a civil rights leader.</p>
<p>John Lewis: It may sound sort of silly, sort of strange, but I wouldn't be the person I am today if it was not for those chickens.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was my calling to take care of these innocent little creatures. I'm convinced those chickens that I preached to in the '40s and the '50s tended to listen to me much better than some of my colleagues listen to me today in the Congress. Really! Most of those chickens were a little more productive. At least they produce eggs.</p>
<p>They taught me discipline, they taught me patience, they taught me hard work and stick-to-it-ness.</p>
<p>You talk about Emmett Till's death as a pivotal moment for you, and it seems like Trayvon Martin's death has been a touchstone for a new generation of activists. Yet both of their deaths came at a time when violence against young black men was not rare. Why do you think each case hit a nerve?</p>
<p>John Lewis: I think there are certain periods in our history?just a spark. &amp;#160;</p>
<p>I was 15 years old, working out in the field when I heard what happened. I kept thinking that it could happen to me, but especially to some of my cousins who lived in Buffalo, New York, who would come South in the summer to spend time with us.</p>
<p>A few months later, when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat, one thing she said in later years was, ?It's not just my feet that were tired, but also, I thought about Emmett Till.? I remember that very, very well.</p>
<p>One of the things that the comic format does so well for this story is capture the violence and brutality that practitioners of nonviolence went through, both in preparation for and during actions. I particularly loved the sequence where one person quit training, saying it was too hard. Talk about the process of getting those moments on paper.</p>
<p>John Lewis: We provided the words, but [the artist] Nate Powell?I love his capacity to capture the drama, to bring it to life, to make it real. You can see it; you can feel it. Even though I lived through it, to see it there makes the words sing.</p>
<p>Andrew Aydin: This is very much centered around stories that I've heard the Congressman tell to all these people over the years. Nate lifted that off the paper and made it something at a whole other level. He's very good at finding a natural flow for your eye.</p>
<p>We tried make sure that it wasn't just accurate for the sake of telling the story, but accurate for the sake of instructing, so that people who have never been to a nonviolent workshop could read and understand what one was. Nate really captured that.</p>
<p>Another thing I think the book did well was capture the real work that went on behind the scenes. We're so rarely shown how many years of preparation and organizing went into making movements happen. I'd love to hear about the challenges of showing that part of the story.</p>
<p>John Lewis: The planning, the training, the nitty-gritty organizing?you may wait for days or weeks or even months before you see something. But you do it. You're consistent and you're persistent, day in and day out.</p>
<p>Andrew Aydin: You see how this work ethic has just been such an omnipresent force in the Congressman?s life since he was 17, 18 years old?or even before that, on the farm. I remember at several points asking ?What time did that take place?? and he'd be like ?Oh, 5:00, 6:00 a.m.? And you realize these are college kids. How many college kids today get up at 5:00 in the morning, much less to go to an organizing meeting before class?</p>
<p>John Lewis: On April the 19, 1960, the attorney for the Nashville movement who had defended the students, his home was bombed around 6:00 a.m. And by 6:30 or 6:45 we were in a meeting. Students came from all over the city and we made a decision?it was a consensus?that we would have a march from the heart of the student community down to city hall. We sent the mayor of the city a telegram to meet us at high noon. There were more than 4,000 students saying, ?Mr. Mayor, do you favor desegregation of the lunch counters?? And the next day, the banner headline in the local paper read that the Mayor said Yes to the integration of the lunch counters.</p>
<p>It was that sense that we had to act, we had to do something, we couldn't wait.</p>
<p>Andrew Aydin: You always say, ?You gotta get up! You can't sleep through the revolution!?</p>
<p></p>

<p>The anniversary of the March on Washington is approaching quickly, and it's never seemed more relevant in my lifetime. We're seeing renewed attacks on civil rights and voting rights, along with a renewed movement for racial and economic justice. How are you feeling about the present day?</p>
<p>John Lewis: In spite of all the problems and difficulties, all the apparent setbacks, delays, I feel very hopeful, very optimistic. I think we are in the process of building a very powerful movement.</p>
<p>North Carolina's governor just yesterday signed into law one of the most unbelievable pieces of legislation that would lead to a systematic, deliberate effort to suppress the votes of minorities, young people and the elderly. But in spite of that, I'm hopeful that we're going to continue to push, and it's going to start the fire for a real movement. Look at what's happening in North Carolina now, the Moral Mondays. It's a good sign. It'll spread around, not just the South, but around America.</p>
<p>What do you hope that some of those young people involved in North Carolina, camping out in the capitol in Florida, what do you hope that they take away from this comic?</p>
<p>John Lewis: It's my hope that many of the young people will have an opportunity to read March and be inspired, and see another generation got out there and did what they could, and that we too must pick up and push the ball further down the road.</p>
<p>Andrew Aydin: Some people have started getting advance copies, and one of them gave the book to his 9-year-old son.</p>
<p>John Lewis: It's a white man, right?</p>
<p>Andrew Aydin: Yes. His kid read the book, enjoyed it, had a little trouble with Emmett Till's death, but it resonated with him, and so now he's put on a suit and is marching around his house demanding equality.</p>
<p>What does that say about what we have to look forward to?</p>
<p>John Lewis: They shall lead the way. Like the children in Birmingham and Selma, Albany, Georgia and other parts. They led the way.</p>
<p>Andrew Aydin: That's part of the bigger message that I think we'll really be able to get into after this book. Because the tactics that worked in Birmingham didn't necessarily work in Albany, and they had to change. Tactics in one city didn't work for every foe or every objective. From that original idea of the Montgomery bus boycott being useful as an example of successful nonviolent direct action, the whole premise is showing more and more examples of different tactics used to express different forms of opposition. As activists today look for new tactics to address their own opposition, they have inspiration and they see concrete examples of how things were reimagined but still stuck to the basic tenets, the philosophy and discipline of nonviolence.</p>

<article id="0000094" title="Who Was Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Why Would Donald Trump Have Hated Her?"><p>Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the Parkland, Florida school, where fourteen kids and three adults were murdered by a maniac with an AR-15 assault weapon, has become a flash point in the debate for gun safety. That debate has been driven mainly by the student survivors themselves. Their passionate and articulate commitment to finally making change happen is one of the few signs of hope in the aftermath of yet another massacre.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/NewsCorpse/posts/2045669458781172" type="external"></a></p>
<p>However, little has been reported about the namesake of the school, Marjory Stoneman Douglas. As it turns out, she was an inspiring woman who was a fierce advocate for speaking out on matters of importance. During a life of activism and personal sacrifice she was quoted as saying ?You have to stand up for some things in this world.? She lived those words throughout her life and inspired others to do the same. In 1993 she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Bill Clinton. And while in the White House that day she was <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/before-the-massacre-at-the-school-named-in-her-honor-marjory-stoneman-douglas-was-there-when-the-brady-bill-was-signed?via=newsletter&amp;amp;source=Weekend" type="external">invited to witness</a> the signing of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brady_Handgun_Violence_Prevention_Act" type="external">Brady Bill</a>).</p>
<p>But that isn?t the only eerie coincidence about Douglas and the specific focus of her activism. According to a <a href="https://www.nps.gov/ever/learn/historyculture/msdouglas.htm" type="external">biography</a> on the National Park Service website:</p>
<p>Marjory Stoneman Douglas, born April 7, 1890 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, graduated from Wellesley with straight A?s with the elected honor of ?Class Orator.? That title proved to be prophetic.</p>
<p>In 1915, following a brief and calamitous marriage, she arrived in Miami, working for her father at the Miami Herald. She worked first as a society reporter, then as an editorial page columnist, and later established herself as a writer of note. Here she took on the fight for feminism, racial justice, and conservation long before these causes became popular.</p>
<p>So Douglas began her professional career as a journalist. Or as Donald Trump would say ?an <a href="" type="internal">enemy of the American people</a>.? She went on to champion women?s rights, something Trump has ridiculed and whose personal history of sexual harassment and assault demonstrates extreme disrespect and misogyny. Douglas was also a proponent of civil rights and racial justice. That contrasts with Trump?s overt bigotry and that of his base, which includes KKK and Nazi leaders and organizations. And finally, Douglas was best known for her environmental activism and her work to conserve the Florida Everglades. She wrote a landmark book on the subject titled, <a href="http://amzn.to/2ETIWrQ" type="external">The Everglades: River of Grass</a>.</p>
<p>Trump surely doesn?t anything about Douglas or her lifelong dedication to service and social change. But if he did he would certainly despise her and attack her with a flurry of furious and derogatory tweets. He insult her and make up stupid nicknames. And he would express his opposition to everything she stood for. All of this adds a rather somber poignancy to the tragedy in Parkland. But it may explain the stirring and righteous reaction from the students who probably do know Douglas and her work. They are likely inspired by quotes like this one: ?I believe that life should be lived so vividly and so intensely that thoughts of another life, or of a longer life, are not necessary.?? And it may explain the heartrending intensity of their oratory as exemplified in this speech by student Emma Gonzalez:</p>

<article id="0000103" published-at="2018-07-14" title="GOP?s Top Campaign Whisperers for 2012 Presidential Candidates"><p><a href="/content/dailybeast/cheats/2011/10/12/mitt-romney-outshines-debate-opponents.html" type="external">Mitt Romney</a>?s economic advisers are as squarely establishment as he is.</p>
<p>This is reassuring to old-school conservatives like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/opinion/brooks-in-defense-of-romney.html" type="external">New York Times columnist David Brooks</a>, who calls them the ?gold standard of adviser teams,? and it could appeal to middle-of-the-road voters in a general election. They aren?t purists or populists, but then, Republican primary voters already know Romney?s not that guy.</p>
<p>The people who whisper advice into a candidate?s ear don?t usually get much attention, but they were a hot topic at <a href="/content/dailybeast/articles/2011/10/11/gop-debate-bloomberg-washington-post-wbin-tv-daily-beast-contributors-respond.html" type="external">Tuesday?s GOP debate on the economy</a>. Asked whom they?d rely on for economic guidance, the candidates gave answers ranging from ?the American people? (Herman Cain) to ?my own father? (Jon Huntsman) to pioneering conservative economist Milton Friedman (who is unavailable; he died in 2006). That last came from Romney, perhaps trying to soften the impact of who his advisers really are?two Ivy League academics and two Capitol Hill veterans who are as mainstream as they come.</p>
<p><a href="/content/dailybeast/articles/2011/09/27/rick-perry-s-missing-platform-in-the-2012-presidential-policy-wars.html" type="external">Rick Perry</a>, who will unveil his economic plan starting with an energy speech on Friday, did not get a chance to answer that question during the New Hampshire debate. But his campaign told me Wednesday that Steve Forbes is among those advising the Texas governor. Forbes, chairman and editor in chief of Forbes Media, ran for president in 1996 and 2000 and pushed both times for a flat tax, <a href="http://www.issues2000.org/Celeb/Steve_Forbes_Social_Security.htm" type="external">private Social Security accounts</a>, and medical savings accounts.</p>
<p>The most obscure name that came up onstage was Rich Lowrie, a Cleveland-area wealth manager for Wells Fargo?not to be confused with National Review editor Rich Lowry. Lowrie is Cain?s senior economic adviser and the man who helped him work up the <a href="/content/dailybeast/articles/2011/10/12/michael-tomasky-herman-cain-s-9-9-9-plan-revolutionary-for-the-rich.html" type="external">9-9-9 plan that?s drawing new scrutiny</a> as Cain surges and even leads in some state and national polls. Lowrie has a degree in accounting, not economics, from Case Western Reserve University. He served three years on the advisory board of the conservative group Americans for Prosperity, backed by the billionaire Koch brothers, at a time when Cain headed its ?Prosperity Expansion Project.? Lowrie is now on the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/rich-lowrie/a/74b/805" type="external">advisory board of the American Conservative Union</a>.</p>
<p>The 9-9-9 plan would replace the current tax code with a 9 percent national sales tax, a 9 percent individual income tax, and a 9 percent corporate income tax. Lowrie has been <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/richlowrie" type="external">playing defense on Twitter</a> as Cain?s rivals go on the attack. It was back to the future?and supply-side economics?Wednesday when Lowrie retweeted praise from Karol Hansen, a Southern California wife, mother, Sunday school teacher, and author of a children?s book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B003C8AWQ4/thedaibea-20/" type="external">Easter Egg Hunt for Jesus</a>. ?I respect Art Laffer who was one of Reagan?s economic advisors and he says he likes the 9-9-9 plan very much!? she tweeted.</p>
<p>Cain, who is running a shoestring campaign, said he has other advisers but declined to name them.</p>
<p>The Romney brain trust includes Columbia Business School dean Glenn Hubbard and Harvard professor Gregory Mankiw, each of whom served as chief economic adviser to George W. Bush. Also on the team are two former swing-state members of Congress: former Sen. Jim Talent of Missouri, now a defense expert at the Heritage Foundation, and former Rep. Vin Weber of Minnesota, a lobbyist and GOP strategist. All were lying low on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Both economists have displayed flashes of ideological independence. Hubbard was influential in designing Bush?s signature 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. But he has said he grew uneasy about the tax cuts as deficit spending surged during Bush?s eight years on such big-ticket items as the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Hubbard <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/12/hubbard_i_wouldnt_support_a_pe.html" type="external">told The Washington Post?s Ezra Klein</a> last December that he does not support a permanent extension of the Bush-era rates.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2011/07/11/glenn-hubbard-why-raising-taxes-wont-work/" type="external">July interview with Fortune</a>, Hubbard said he was ?mystified by both sides? emphasis on the Bush tax cuts as if those are religious articles to either attack at one side or defend on the other. What we need is tax reform?? He suggested going after deductions and other ?tax expenditures? to wring more revenue from the tax system in the near term.</p>
<p>That?s what Romney did as governor of Massachusetts? <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/us/politics/romneys-strategies-as-governor-bucked-his-ceo-image.html?pagewanted=all" type="external">scour the tax code</a> for corporate loopholes?and it did not endear him to conservatives or the business community. Still, some national conservatives, such as Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK), have been open to the idea, given the soaring national debt and Republican resistance to raising tax rates.</p>
<p>Documentary lovers may recall Hubbard from his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlIoeTObmEk" type="external">cameo in the 2010 film Inside Job</a>. He lost his temper on camera when director Charles Ferguson asked him if there was a potential conflict of interest in his unreported consulting work for financial-services firms. ?This isn?t a deposition, sir. I was polite enough to give you time, foolishly, I now see. But you have three more minutes. Give it your best shot,? Hubbard snapped.</p>
<p>Start and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.</p>
<p>A speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).</p>
<p>The academic had another moment in the spotlight at Tuesday night?s Washington Post/Bloomberg debate, when Perry told Romney that Hubbard, ?your chief economic adviser? who you know well, he said that Romneycare was Obamacare. And Romneycare has driven the cost of small-business insurance premiums up by 14 percent over the national average??</p>
<p>Romney said his plan is not like Obama?s and added that ?Glenn Hubbard is a fine fellow.? But a 2010 paper co-authored by Hubbard backs up Perry?s points. ?Because the [Massachusetts] Plan?s main components are the same as those of the new health reform law, the effects of the Plan provide a window onto the country?s future,? the authors wrote. They said the Massachusetts experience suggests that federal policymakers ?should be concerned? about the impact of the law on the cost of private insurance.</p>
<p>Mankiw succeeded Hubbard in the Bush White House despite objections on the right. <a href="http://old.nationalreview.com/moore/moore022803b.asp" type="external">Stephen Moore at National Review</a> upbraided him for calling Ronald Reagan?s supply-side advisers ?charlatans and cranks? and said it didn?t matter if his views had since changed because he had already been ?indoctrinating young economists with wrongheaded thinking.? <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/11/anti-mankiw.html" type="external">Mankiw says</a> he?s also been attacked from the left, by liberals who say his ideas are right-wing propaganda. He says his teaching reflects ?the economic mainstream,? which he defines as slightly right of center.</p>
<p>As for Romney?s other two advisers, Talent is a supporter of robust defense spending whose views are reflected in Romney?s call to build more ships, ramp up missile defense, add 100,000 troops, and raise military spending from 3.8 percent to 4 percent of gross domestic product. Weber is the fifth most influential lobbyist in Washington, or at least he was in 2007, <a href="http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/mediapolitics/4264.html" type="external">according to Washingtonian magazine</a>. Being a lobbyist is not a selling point, but Weber has another credential, one that Romney sorely needs. Elected to the House in 1980, he was a soldier in Reagan?s supply-side revolution.</p>
<p>In the end, Romney will win or lose the nomination on his own. But his gold-plated economic team may give conservatives yet another reason to be wary of him.</p></article>
<article id="0000106" published-at="2009-02-18" title="Al Sharpton Is Wrong About the Monkey Cartoon"><p>Photo from flickr user floridapfe</p>
<p></p>
<p>In today?s New York Post there?s a Sean Delonas <a href="http://www.nypost.com/delonas/2009/02/02182009.jpg" type="external">cartoon</a> that shows two policemen standing over a dead chimpanzee. One is holding a handgun while the other says, ?They?ll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill.?</p>
<p>Al Sharpton is very offended. But he shouldn?t be because the cartoon isn?t offensive, unless you?re an ape.</p>
<p>Sharpton issued a statement <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2009/02/18/al-sharpton-monkey-cartoon-obama/" type="external">saying</a>:</p>
<p>The cartoon in today?s New York Post is troubling at best given the historic racist attacks of African-Americans as being synonymous with monkeys. One has to question whether the cartoonist is making a less than casual reference to this when in the cartoon they have police saying after shooting a chimpanzee that ?Now they will have to find someone else to write the stimulus bill.?</p>
<p>Being that the stimulus bill has been the first legislative victory of President Barack Obama (the first African American president) and has become synonymous with him it is not a reach to wonder are they inferring that a monkey wrote the last bill?</p>
<p>Well actually, yes, it is a reach. That?s why the New York Post refuses to apologize and issued this <a href="http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/race/2009/02/outraged-readers-complain-about-chimp-cartoon-.html" type="external">statement</a>:</p>
<p>The cartoon is a clear parody of a current news event, to wit the shooting of a violent chimpanzee in Connecticut. It broadly mocks Washington?s efforts to revive the economy. Again, Al Sharpton reveals himself as nothing more than a publicity opportunist.</p>
<p>I?ll leave Sharpton?s motivation alone, but this whole thing seems a little puzzling. Consider three recent events.</p>
<p>Guess which one of these is irrelevant to the cartoon? If you picked&amp;#160; #1, you?re right. This cartoon has nothing to do with the ethnicity of Obama?s father and everything to do with the fact that the stimulus bill is messy. So messy, in fact, that it could have been written by a chimpanzee.</p>
<p>The truth is, it?s not a good cartoon. Because it is an awkward attempt to combine two unrelated news stories, it doesn?t resonate, not in the way that <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_q0ioDxOSoAA/Rwuul_0jFnI/AAAAAAAAABA/f1eVEc3HV2A/s200/nycover3.jpg" type="external">this</a> really wonderful cartoon does. You many not even get the cartoon at all (stimulus=monkey?), but that?s understandable because it?s not that funny; it?s just not racist either. Sometimes a joke about monkeys is, well, just a joke about monkeys.</p>

<p>Advertising revenue rose 11 percent to $16.02 billion in the second quarter ended June 30 from a year earlier, while the number of ads, or paid clicks, rose 18 percent, the company said.</p>
<p>Advertisers pay Google only if a user clicks on one of their ads. "Cost per click", or the average price of online ads, fell 11 percent in the quarter, but was more than offset by the increase in ad volumes.</p>
<p>Google's ad revenue has been under pressure from consumers accessing its online services on mobiles devices such as smartphones and tablets, where ad rates are typically lower.</p>

<article id="0000111" published-at="2012-10-18" title="IVN Launches Local Edition of Non-Partisan News Platform The Treatment: Civil Discourse The Technology: Localization The Risk: Abuse The Protection: Etiquette"><p><a href="" type="internal"></a>Party central committees, partisan special interests, and courts overseen by party-appointed judges have <a href="" type="internal">steadily reframed election law</a> in such a way that the failure to affiliate with one of the two institutionalized political parties voids an individual?s ability to have meaningful participation in the political process. As a result, legislators are held accountable only by their partisan base.</p>
<p>The partisan consolidation of power has accelerated rapidly over the past 75 years. Attempts to change our election laws and inform voters will not alone stop the polarization of our political system. Even traditional media has reorganized the dialogue around a superficial two-sided debate and accepted the notion that a virtual pre-requisite for full voter participation is party affiliation.</p>
<p>To change the political process, we have to start with the political dialogue. <a href="" type="internal">IVN.us</a>&amp;#160;was established to promote such a change. The goal is to create a news source where the news is unfiltered by partisan interests. In short, IVN.us is an online news platform for communication between independent-minded voters, public officials, civic leaders, and journalists.</p>
<p>The news network was BETA tested at the end of 2011, and Phase 1 was officially launched in January 2012. Today, IVN reaches over a million people online each week. Now, we are bringing IVN to the local level.</p>
<p>On October 17th, 2012, IVN launched the first local prototype in its hometown:&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">IVN San Diego Edition</a>. In the old days, starting a news outlet was out of the question; unless you were a billionaire. IVN has taken today?s technology and created a platform that is more powerful, more dynamic, and more open to credible journalists than anything ever built. We will bring this technology to other cities that share a common desire for good and diverse journalism. And it won?t take a billionaire to get us there. Just you.</p>
<p>The biggest risk of an open platform is abuse of its capabilities. The biggest challenge is maintaining credibility amid forces that will see IVN as competition and who don?t hold themselves to the&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">IVN etiquette</a>. We are qualified to overcome these challenges because we have gotten this far with a couple computers and some big hearts. We will overcome these risks and challenges with the support of people like you will.</p>
<p>IVN?s reputation, credibility, and status as a news source are preserved through its adherence to a published etiquette and editorial guideline. These guidelines ensure that both contributors and readers benefit from robust and diverse content in a civil environment.</p>
<p>1. No personal attacks.&amp;#160; 2. No self-promotion.&amp;#160; 3. Sources must be substantiated. 4. No partisan-based attacks.</p>
<p>Please join us by making a pledge to IVN so that we can elevate the level of civil discourse and break down the barriers to participation in both news and politics.</p>
<p>And if you haven?t already, please follow us on&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/independentvoternetwork?fref=ts" type="external">Facebook</a>,&amp;#160; <a href="https://twitter.com/IVNetwork" type="external">Twitter</a>, and&amp;#160; <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/101219378970530930435/posts" type="external">Google+</a>&amp;#160;if we haven?t asked enough of you already.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the reports on the topic, however, omitted a rather key piece of context?namely, whom the weapons will be used to kill.</p>
<p>The famine and brutal two-year-long war in Yemen being waged by the Saudis that has killed over 10,000 civilians wasn?t mentioned once in reports of the $300 billion deal to Saudi Arabia by CNN ( <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/19/politics/jared-kushner-saudi-arms-deal-lockheed-martin/" type="external">5/19/17</a>, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/video/news/2017/05/20/trump-arms-deal-saudi-arabia.cnnmoney/" type="external">5/20/17</a>), Washington Post &amp;#160;( <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/us-saudi-arabia-reach-tentative-pacts-potentially-worth-110-billion/2017/05/20/2a919826-3d91-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html?utm_term=.3b890942b931" type="external">5/19/17</a>), The Independent ( <a href="https://www.independent.co.ug/us-saudi-agree-arms-deals-worth-almost-110-billion/" type="external">5/19/17</a>), New York Daily News ( <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-closes-110-billion-military-arms-deal-saudi-arabia-article-1.3181686" type="external">5/20/17</a>), CNBC ( <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/20/us-saudi-arabia-seal-weapons-deal-worth-nearly-110-billion-as-trump-begins-visit.html" type="external">5/20/17</a>, <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/22/defense-stocks-rally-on-110-billion-us-saudi-arabia-weapons-deal.html" type="external">5/22/17</a>), CBS News ( <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-signs-110-billion-arms-deal-with-saudi-arabia/" type="external">5/20/17</a>), Business Insider ( <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ap-us-to-announce-110-billion-saudi-arms-sale-as-trump-visits-2017-5" type="external">5/20/17</a>), Time ( <a href="http://time.com/4787238/us-saudi-arabia-arms-deal/?xid=time_socialflow_twitter" type="external">5/20/17</a>), Fox News ( <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/05/20/trump-arrives-to-saudi-arabia-for-his-first-international-trip-since-taking-office.html" type="external">5/20/17</a>), Reuters ( <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-saudi-deals-idUKKCN18G0L3?utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;amp;utm_content=5920680204d3013d68debcf3&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter" type="external">5/20/17</a>), ABC News ( <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-signs-110-billion-arms-deal-saudi-arabia/story?id=47531180" type="external">5/20/17</a>), Fortune Magazine ( <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/05/20/donald-trump-saudi-arabia-trip/" type="external">5/20/17</a>) or Chicago Tribune ( <a href="" type="external">5/20/17</a>).</p>
<p>The arms deal was typically framed in vague ?security? terms, with an emphasis on Saudi Arabia?s role in fighting ?terrorism? (e.g., ?The White House says the package includes defense equipment? to help the Arab nation and the rest of the Gulf region fight against terrorism??Fox News, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/05/20/trump-arrives-to-saudi-arabia-for-his-first-international-trip-since-taking-office.html" type="external">5/20/17</a>), despite the fact that the bulk of its military activity is focused on bombing Shia Houthi rebels in Yemen that have nothing to do with terrorism as such.</p>
<p>That hundreds of billions of arms would be going to Al Qaeda?s allies wasn?t touched on in reports on the arms deal.</p>
<p>Indeed, the head of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170501110714/http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/al-qaida-leader-group-fought-alongside-us-backed-47125267" type="external">claimed earlier this month</a> his forces were ?fighting alongside? the Saudi-backed Yemeni government. This detail was also omitted from reports on the arms deal, presumably because it would messy up the ?Saudi Arabia?as?partner?in?War on Terror? narrative the press was uncritically echoing.</p>
<p>In his report on the arms deal, the Washington Post?s Steven Mufson ( <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/us-saudi-arabia-reach-tentative-pacts-potentially-worth-110-billion/2017/05/20/2a919826-3d91-11e7-9e48-c4f199710b69_story.html?utm_term=.d253455a7d7c" type="external">5/21/17</a>) got quotes from the CEO of Lockheed Martin and reps from General Electric and private-equity firm Blackstone, but found no time to interview a human rights expert or aid worker or victim of Saudi bombing of Yemen; indeed, that bombing wasn?t even mentioned. Likewise, CNBC ( <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/22/defense-stocks-rally-on-110-billion-us-saudi-arabia-weapons-deal.html" type="external">5/22/17</a>) issued a sexed-up press release Monday morning about how ?defense stocks soar to all-time highs on $110 billion US/Saudi Arabia weapons deal??with no mention of whom, exactly, said weapons were killing.</p>
<p>Many outlets went with the ?jobs? frame, echoing the White House narrative that the selling of arms to a dictatorship waging a brutal war on a neighboring country was, in fact, good because it ?created jobs.?</p>
<p>A Trump campaign ad wouldn?t have framed the issue differently than this CBS Miami report.</p>
<p>?Trump Says Arms Deal He Signed With Saudi Arabia Will Create Jobs,? was the NPR headline ( <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/05/20/529309106/trump-says-arms-deal-he-signed-with-saudi-arabia-will-create-jobs" type="external">5/20/17</a>). ?Trump Says Saudi Arabia Deal Will Create ?Jobs, Jobs, Jobs,?? CBS Miami ( <a href="http://miami.cbslocal.com/2017/05/20/trump-saudi-arabia-deal-jobs-jobs-jobs/" type="external">5/20/17</a>) reported. Neither of these reports used the words ?Yemen? or ?bombing? or ?famine.?</p>
<p>To the extent the Saudi bombing of Yemen was gestured at, it was in vague, Risk game?like terms about how Saudi Arabia was a ?check? against ?Iranian aggression??an opaque framing that reduces all Shia populations in the Middle East into mindless Iranian drones in urgent need of an application of Saudi munitions.</p>
<p>?The United States likes to see Saudi Arabia with a strong military because it is seen as a counter to the forces of Iran,? CNN Newsroom ( <a href="http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1705/20/cnr.01.html" type="external">5/20/17</a>) euphemistically explained. It?s not spelled out that ?counter? here means bombing one of the poorest countries on earth for over two years, unleashing what the UN <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/03/15/yemen-famine-humanitarian-relief-conflict-food-insecurity-casualties-of-conflict-saudi-led-intervention/" type="external">calls</a> ?famine-like? conditions affecting nearly 7 million people.</p>

Weapons sales by other countries are put in clear moral terms?as they should be. Those by the United States are sterilized, rendered abstract by omitting the deaths that will inevitably result.</p>
<p>The New York Times ( <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/world/middleeast/trump-yemen-saudi-arabia.html" type="external">5/15/17</a>) did mention the famine and war in Yemen in the context of the arms deal last week, but one article on the subject from Thursday ( <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-arabia-summit.html?_r=0" type="external">5/18/17</a>), for unknown reasons, <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronjmate/status/865636012755566592" type="external">removed</a> this passage expressly noting the Saudis? history of buying US weapons:</p>
<p>The Saudis have spent a fortune on US weapons over the years, and a series of new deals that could be worth more than $300 billion over the next decade are close to completion, Reuters reported this month.</p>
<p>You can see the original, as reprinted in the Boston Globe, <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/world/2017/05/18/saudi-arabia-will-give-trump-royal-welcome-ignore-his-slights/LeqkorxmQ67HwvgXLf1GfI/story.html" type="external">here</a>.</p>
<p>As of Monday afternoon, no major newspaper?New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, LA Times, Chicago Tribune or Daily News?has run an editorial condemning Trump for cozying up with and selling massive amounts of arms to the Saudi dictatorship. As FAIR noted last week <a href="" type="internal">(5/17/17</a>), this outrage remains solely directed at dictatorships not in good standing with the US State Department.</p>
<p>Such is most reporting on the US?s relationship with Saudi Arabia. The human rights framework so much of the pundit class lives by?the moral positioning that gives the US the unique right to interfere in conflicts throughout the globe?is suddenly, and without explanation, suspended. The US backs Saudi war crimes despite their brutality, never because of it. It sells arms in hopes they will reform, never because they have.</p>
<p>And unlike our enemies, no one in particular is responsible. No ?Salman regime did X,? no ?forces loyal to Salman regime bombed Y.? Saudi Arabia remains a game of moral hot potato, no one is to blame and, somehow, everyone is a reformer.</p>

<article id="0000117" published-at="2018-01-15" title="Trump has kept many promises during his first year in office"><p>WASHINGTON (AP) ? President Donald Trump often brags that he's done more in his first year in office than any other president. That's a spectacular stretch.</p>
<p>But while he's fallen short on many measures and has a strikingly thin legislative record, Trump has followed through on dozens of his campaign promises, overhauling the country's tax system, changing the U.S. posture abroad and upending the lives of hundreds of thousands of immigrants.</p>
<p>A year in, Trump is no closer to making Mexico pay for a border wall than when he made supporters swoon with that promise at those rollicking campaign rallies of 2016.</p>
<p>He's run into legislative roadblocks ? from fellow Republicans, no less ? at big moments, which is why the Obama-era health law survives, wounded but still insuring millions. His own administration's sloppy start explains why none of the laws he pledged to sign in his first 100 days came to reality then and why most are still aspirational.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Trump has nailed the tax overhaul, his only historic legislative accomplishment to date, won confirmation of a conservative Supreme Court justice and other federal judges, and used his executive powers with vigor to slice regulations and pull the U.S. away from international accords he assailed as a candidate.</p>
<p>Courts tied his most provocative actions on immigration and Muslim entry in knots, but illegal border crossings appear to be at historic lows.</p>
<p>The upshot? For all his rogue tendencies, Trump has shaped up as a largely conventional Republican president when measured by his promises kept and in motion.</p>
<p>The Twitter version of Trump may be jazzed with braggadocio about the size of his (nonexistent) nuclear button and his "very stable genius." But the ledger of actions taken is recognizable to Washington: mainstream Republican tax cuts, pro-business policy (with exceptions on trade), curbs on environmental regulation and an approach to health care that's been in the GOP playbook for years.</p>
<p>That's as of today and this moment. With Trump, you never know about tomorrow.</p>
<p>A look at some of his campaign promises and what's happened with them:</p>
<p>TAXES</p>
<p>Trump and congressional Republicans delivered on an overhaul that substantially lowers corporate taxes and cuts personal income taxes, as promised. It's sizable but not everything Trump said it would be, and it is more tilted to the wealthy than he promised or will admit. He promised a 15 percent tax rate for corporations and settled for 21 percent, still a major drop from 35 percent. He promised three tax brackets; there are still seven. He did not eliminate the estate tax or the alternative minimum tax as he said he would. Fewer people will be subject to those taxes, however, at least temporarily.</p>
<p>"Everybody is getting a tax cut, especially the middle class," he said in the campaign. Most will; some will pay more.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>TRADE</p>
<p>Trump made good on his promise to withdraw the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and to reopen the North American Free Trade Agreement in search of a better deal.</p>
<p>He's let China off the hook, though, on his oft-repeated threat during the campaign to brand Beijing a currency manipulator, a step toward potentially hefty penalties on Chinese imports and a likely spark for a trade war.</p>
<p>"We're like the piggy bank that's being robbed," he said of the trade relationship, which has tipped even more in China's favor since. Trump now threatens trade punishment if China does not sufficiently cooperate in reining in North Korea.</p>
<p>Trump promised to impose a 35 percent tariff on goods from U.S. companies that ship production abroad. He's not delivered on that. Instead, his tax plan aims to encourage companies to stay in the U.S. with the lower tax rate and to entice those operating abroad to come home by letting them repatriate their profits in the U.S. at a temporarily discounted rate. His approach so far is all carrot, no stick.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>IMMIGRATION</p>
<p>Candidate Trump rocked the political landscape when he proposed a temporary ban on all non-U.S. Muslims entering the country. While he's long backed away from such talk, Trump has worked since his first days in office to impose new restrictions on tourists and immigrants, signing executive orders that would have made good on his anti-immigration promises had those orders not been blocked by courts.</p>
<p>He's now succeeded in banning the entry of citizens from several Muslim-majority countries and in severely curbing refugee admissions. He's tried to deny certain federal money for cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.</p>
<p>Trump is now deep in negotiations over an immigration deal that could deliver on other promises, including money for the border wall with Mexico and overhauling the legal immigration system to make it harder for immigrants to sponsor their families. That's in exchange for extending protections for hundreds of thousands of young people brought to the country illegally as children. They are protections he once slammed as an "illegal" amnesty and pledged to end.</p>
<p>Mexico still isn't ponying up money for the wall.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Trump promised aggressive action on the energy front and has pursued that.</p>
<p>He announced his intention to take the U.S. out of the Paris climate-change accord. He gave swift approval to the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines stalled by President Barack Obama, moved to shrink protected national monument lands in Utah and Arizona, and acted to lift restrictions on mining coal and coastal drilling for oil and natural gas.</p>
<p>A provision in the new tax law opens the long-protected Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.</p>
<p>As other countries turn harder toward green energy, Trump is making fossil fuels the centerpiece of his drive toward energy independence ? a benchmark that Obama closed in on during an era of surging natural gas development.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>HEALTH CARE</p>
<p>Probably nothing exemplifies frustrated ambition more than the Obama health law Republicans have been trying to dismantle ever since it was enacted in 2010. Trump has declared it dead many times ? he just never got around to killing it.</p>
<p>He made this overpromise in the campaign: "My first day in office, I'm going to ask Congress to put a bill on my desk getting rid of this disastrous law and replacing it with reforms that expand choice, freedom, affordability. You're going to have such great health care at a tiny fraction of the cost. It's going to be so easy."</p>
<p>That hasn't happened.</p>
<p>Republicans took several runs at repealing and replacing the law last year, only to fall short. The December tax law, though, is knocking out a pillar. As of 2019, the requirement to carry health insurance or pay a fine will be gone.</p>
<p>Trump has come out with a proposed regulation to promote the sale of health plans across state lines. The goal is to make it easier for associations to sponsor plans that are cheaper than Affordable Care Act policies but don't have to meet all consumer protection and benefit requirements of that law.</p>
<p>Insurance industry groups, patient groups and some state regulators are wary of the idea and see little chance it can make more than a dent in the ranks of the uninsured (nearly 30 million). Easing restrictions on the sale of health insurance across state lines has been a longtime mainstream conservative goal.</p>
<p>He also promised to authorize Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices. It hasn't been done.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>'AMERICA FIRST' ABROAD</p>
<p>Trump promised swift victory over the Islamic State group. Over the past year, U.S. and coalition-backed local forces in Iraq and Syria did deal a crushing blow to IS, ousting the militants from most of the territory they once held. The success built on the strategy of the Obama administration to work with and through local forces. Trump did relax restrictions on the number of U.S. troops who could be deployed both to Iraq and Syria, and that aided the final push.</p>
<p>U.S. commanders, however, stop short of saying IS is defeated, pointing to remaining militants and fighting in Syria. They also note the group has spawned affiliates in other countries, such as Afghanistan and Yemen, where they routinely attack U.S. forces and allies. While reeling as a territorial force, the IS group has inspired terrorist attacks in the West.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has yet to see the massive increase in military spending that Trump has promised. That still might come, but the protracted struggle to pass a Pentagon budget of whatever size has hurt U.S. military readiness, defense officials say.</p>
<p>More broadly, Trump's "America First" ethic has been reflected in his pressure on member NATO countries to step up their own military spending, in his wariness of international accords and in the seeming drift from a diplomatic tradition of promoting U.S. democratic values abroad.</p>
<p>Past presidents made common cause with authoritarian figures, and their promotion of values could be cursory. But Trump has lavished praise on select strongmen, from the Philippines to China to Russia and beyond.</p>
<p>Despite railing against the Iran nuclear deal as a candidate, Trump has so far passed up opportunities to get the U.S. out of it. On the other hand, he rolled back part of Obama's opening to Cuba. He also moved forward on recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a goal that both parties have embraced in their platforms for decades but never acted on.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>INFRASTRUCTURE</p>
<p>Trump pledged a $1 trillion effort to rebuild the country's airports, roads, bridges and other infrastructure. As with his tax plan, it's shaping up to be less ambitious than promised, though it still might be significant. Placed behind the failed effort to repeal the health law and the successful one to cut taxes, infrastructure may or may not emerge as a proposal in coming weeks. Trump's idea appears to involve using federal tax dollars to leverage state government and private spending, not to mount a New Deal-era explosion of federal projects.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>VETERANS</p>
<p>Having previously criticized the Department of Veterans Affairs as the "most corrupt," Trump delivered on one campaign promise by signing legislation to make it easier for VA employees to be fired for misconduct.</p>
<p>At least for now, its impact in bringing accountability to the department remains unclear. The pace of VA firings during Obama's last budget year was higher than during Trump's first, which covered the first nine months of his administration.</p>
<p>Other Trump initiatives announced with fanfare in 2017 remain far from complete or have been limited because of questions about rising government costs: a multibillion-dollar overhaul of electronic medical records, expanded access to doctors to reduce wait times and a goal of hiring 1,000 additional mental health counselors in the first year. The VA has been clouded by a 2014 scandal at the Phoenix VA hospital in which employees manipulated records to hide appointment delays.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>... AND MORE</p>
<p>Despite his promises, Trump hasn't pushed for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on Congress members or worked to end birthright citizenship, and he hasn't made good on his pledge to drop "dirty, rotten traitor" Bowe Bergdahl out of an airplane over Afghanistan without a parachute.</p>
<p>Trump, who spends nearly every weekend golfing at one of his properties, most certainly hasn't fulfilled his promise never to take a vacation while serving as president.</p>
<p>Indeed, Trump has visited properties he owns nearly one of every three days he's been in office, raising a tangle of ethical questions about whether he's profiting from his presidency.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>THE BIG BOAST</p>
<p>Trump didn't wait for his first 100 days to expire before boasting that his presidential achievements thus far surpassed anything in history, and he hasn't let up since. He's bragged of having signed more than 80 pieces of legislation into law, but there's little of consequence in that pile.</p>
<p>He's signed laws naming federal buildings after people, appointing a Smithsonian Institution regent and other housekeeping steps that all presidents do but tend not to make a fuss about.</p>
<p>In contrast, Obama signed an enormous stimulus package into law in his first month while also achieving a law expanding health care for children and other policy steps.</p>
<p>Then there's Franklin Roosevelt, credited by historians Alan Brinkley and Davis Dyer with achieving "the most concentrated period of U.S. reform in U.S. history," starting immediately with emergency legislation to stabilize the Depression-devastated banking system and setting in place the New Deal with 14 pieces of historic legislation in 100 days.</p>

<p>Trump is now deep in negotiations over an immigration deal that could deliver on other promises, including money for the border wall with Mexico and overhauling the legal immigration system to make it harder for immigrants to sponsor their families. That's in exchange for extending protections for hundreds of thousands of young people brought to the country illegally as children. They are protections he once slammed as an "illegal" amnesty and pledged to end.</p>
<p>Mexico still isn't ponying up money for the wall.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Trump promised aggressive action on the energy front and has pursued that.</p>
<p>He announced his intention to take the U.S. out of the Paris climate-change accord. He gave swift approval to the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines stalled by President Barack Obama, moved to shrink protected national monument lands in Utah and Arizona, and acted to lift restrictions on mining coal and coastal drilling for oil and natural gas.</p>
<p>A provision in the new tax law opens the long-protected Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.</p>
<p>As other countries turn harder toward green energy, Trump is making fossil fuels the centerpiece of his drive toward energy independence ? a benchmark that Obama closed in on during an era of surging natural gas development.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>HEALTH CARE</p>
<p>Probably nothing exemplifies frustrated ambition more than the Obama health law Republicans have been trying to dismantle ever since it was enacted in 2010. Trump has declared it dead many times ? he just never got around to killing it.</p>
<p>He made this overpromise in the campaign: "My first day in office, I'm going to ask Congress to put a bill on my desk getting rid of this disastrous law and replacing it with reforms that expand choice, freedom, affordability. You're going to have such great health care at a tiny fraction of the cost. It's going to be so easy."</p>
<p>That hasn't happened.</p>
<p>Republicans took several runs at repealing and replacing the law last year, only to fall short. The December tax law, though, is knocking out a pillar. As of 2019, the requirement to carry health insurance or pay a fine will be gone.</p>
<p>Trump has come out with a proposed regulation to promote the sale of health plans across state lines. The goal is to make it easier for associations to sponsor plans that are cheaper than Affordable Care Act policies but don't have to meet all consumer protection and benefit requirements of that law.</p>
<p>Insurance industry groups, patient groups and some state regulators are wary of the idea and see little chance it can make more than a dent in the ranks of the uninsured (nearly 30 million). Easing restrictions on the sale of health insurance across state lines has been a longtime mainstream conservative goal.</p>
<p>He also promised to authorize Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices. It hasn't been done.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>'AMERICA FIRST' ABROAD</p>
<p>Trump promised swift victory over the Islamic State group. Over the past year, U.S. and coalition-backed local forces in Iraq and Syria did deal a crushing blow to IS, ousting the militants from most of the territory they once held. The success built on the strategy of the Obama administration to work with and through local forces. Trump did relax restrictions on the number of U.S. troops who could be deployed both to Iraq and Syria, and that aided the final push.</p>
<p>U.S. commanders, however, stop short of saying IS is defeated, pointing to remaining militants and fighting in Syria. They also note the group has spawned affiliates in other countries, such as Afghanistan and Yemen, where they routinely attack U.S. forces and allies. While reeling as a territorial force, the IS group has inspired terrorist attacks in the West.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has yet to see the massive increase in military spending that Trump has promised. That still might come, but the protracted struggle to pass a Pentagon budget of whatever size has hurt U.S. military readiness, defense officials say.</p>
<p>More broadly, Trump's "America First" ethic has been reflected in his pressure on member NATO countries to step up their own military spending, in his wariness of international accords and in the seeming drift from a diplomatic tradition of promoting U.S. democratic values abroad.</p>
<p>Past presidents made common cause with authoritarian figures, and their promotion of values could be cursory. But Trump has lavished praise on select strongmen, from the Philippines to China to Russia and beyond.</p>
<p>Despite railing against the Iran nuclear deal as a candidate, Trump has so far passed up opportunities to get the U.S. out of it. On the other hand, he rolled back part of Obama's opening to Cuba. He also moved forward on recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a goal that both parties have embraced in their platforms for decades but never acted on.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>INFRASTRUCTURE</p>
<p>Trump pledged a $1 trillion effort to rebuild the country's airports, roads, bridges and other infrastructure. As with his tax plan, it's shaping up to be less ambitious than promised, though it still might be significant. Placed behind the failed effort to repeal the health law and the successful one to cut taxes, infrastructure may or may not emerge as a proposal in coming weeks. Trump's idea appears to involve using federal tax dollars to leverage state government and private spending, not to mount a New Deal-era explosion of federal projects.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>VETERANS</p>
<p>Having previously criticized the Department of Veterans Affairs as the "most corrupt," Trump delivered on one campaign promise by signing legislation to make it easier for VA employees to be fired for misconduct.</p>
<p>At least for now, its impact in bringing accountability to the department remains unclear. The pace of VA firings during Obama's last budget year was higher than during Trump's first, which covered the first nine months of his administration.</p>
<p>Other Trump initiatives announced with fanfare in 2017 remain far from complete or have been limited because of questions about rising government costs: a multibillion-dollar overhaul of electronic medical records, expanded access to doctors to reduce wait times and a goal of hiring 1,000 additional mental health counselors in the first year. The VA has been clouded by a 2014 scandal at the Phoenix VA hospital in which employees manipulated records to hide appointment delays.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>... AND MORE</p>
<p>Despite his promises, Trump hasn't pushed for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on Congress members or worked to end birthright citizenship, and he hasn't made good on his pledge to drop "dirty, rotten traitor" Bowe Bergdahl out of an airplane over Afghanistan without a parachute.</p>
<p>Trump, who spends nearly every weekend golfing at one of his properties, most certainly hasn't fulfilled his promise never to take a vacation while serving as president.</p>
<p>Indeed, Trump has visited properties he owns nearly one of every three days he's been in office, raising a tangle of ethical questions about whether he's profiting from his presidency.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>THE BIG BOAST</p>
<p>Trump didn't wait for his first 100 days to expire before boasting that his presidential achievements thus far surpassed anything in history, and he hasn't let up since. He's bragged of having signed more than 80 pieces of legislation into law, but there's little of consequence in that pile.</p>
<p>He's signed laws naming federal buildings after people, appointing a Smithsonian Institution regent and other housekeeping steps that all presidents do but tend not to make a fuss about.</p>
<p>In contrast, Obama signed an enormous stimulus package into law in his first month while also achieving a law expanding health care for children and other policy steps.</p>
<p>Then there's Franklin Roosevelt, credited by historians Alan Brinkley and Davis Dyer with achieving "the most concentrated period of U.S. reform in U.S. history," starting immediately with emergency legislation to stabilize the Depression-devastated banking system and setting in place the New Deal with 14 pieces of historic legislation in 100 days.</p>

<article id="0000119" published-at="2015-05-04" title="ER docs busier than ever since Obamacare, poll shows"><p>Emergency physicians in the U.S.&amp;#160;have reported&amp;#160;an increase in the volume of patients since January 1, 2014, when the Affordable Care Act requiring health insurance went into effect, and they are not confident that ERs across the country are prepared, <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/844196" type="external">according to a new poll.</a></p>
<p>?The reliance on emergency care remains stronger than ever,? said Michael Gerardi, MD, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians,&amp;#160;in a statement. ?It?s the only place that?s open 24/7, and we never turn anyone away.?</p>
<p>The college invited 24,427 member physicians to complete the poll, 2099 of whom did, for a response rate of approximately 9%. The poll was conducted to gauge changes in ED patient volume and care since the Affordable Care Act went into effect.</p>
<p>With the implementation of the ACA, 47% of emergency physicians reported a slight increase in the number of patients, and 28% reported significant increases in patient volume.</p>
<p>56% of emergency physicians&amp;#160;reported an increase in the number of Medicare patients, and 70% fear their ED is not sufficiently prepared for an increase in patient volume. Despite these concerns,&amp;#160;83% have concerns about efforts being made by hospitals to reduce emergency visits; specifically, that patients will put off&amp;#160;medical care or&amp;#160;utilize facilities with less/poorer resources.</p>
<p>?There is strong evidence that Medicaid access to primary care and specialty care is not timely, leaving Medicaid patients with few options other than the [ED],? said&amp;#160;Orlee Panitch, MD, chair of the Emergency Medicine Action Fund, which&amp;#160;ordered the poll.</p>
<p>?In addition, states with punitive policies toward Medicaid patients in the [ED] may be discouraging low-income patients with serious medical conditions from seeking necessary care, which is dangerous and wrong.? Panitch continued.</p>
<p>Dr Gerardi cited concerns about&amp;#160;the closure of hospitals and emergency care facilities&amp;#160;in states that have not expanded Medicaid.</p>
<p>?Hospitals received less Medicare funding for charity care when the [Affordable Care Act] took effect, because more people were supposed to have health insurance coverage,? said Gerardi. ?But in states that didn?t expand Medicaid, hospitals are hurting. For example, the closure of a hospital in Baton Rouge resulted in a crisis for another hospital that inherited all the patients, many of whom are uninsured, and now this hospital may close as well. The average reimbursement for a Medicaid patient in the [ED] is about $43.00, but it?s much lower in many states.?</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Perhaps most alarmingly, 34% of the physicians polled&amp;#160;have considered leaving the profession.</p>

<article id="0000120" published-at="2004-01-30" title="The David Kay Report"><p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>?We were all wrong?</p>
<p>David Kay</p>
<p>We can finally put Weapons of Mass Destruction issue to rest.</p>
<p>With the publishing of the Kay report it is clear that the entire pretense for the Iraq war was nothing more than a hoax. Kay appeared before a Senate subcommittee to disclose his findings and admitted that he and his team had found no stockpiles of proscribed weapons in Iraq.</p>
<p>At one point he opined, ?We were wrong, we were all wrong.?</p>
<p>Wrong?</p>
<p>An estimated 8,000 innocent Iraqis died in the invasion, more than 500 American servicemen were killed in action, an entire country was destabilized and plunged into insurgency, and David Kay talks about being wrong like it was some minor miscalculation on the phone bill?</p>
<p>This is the reality of the Bush Administration?s new ?preemptive? theory; hundreds of billions of dollars are spent, countless lives are lost or ruined, and the world community is thrown into turmoil, and yet, no justification is provided.</p>
<p>Even worse, the head of the weapons inspection team presents his case to Congress as though it was all ?just an honest mistake?.</p>
<p>So, why did Kay choose to address the Senate in the first place?</p>
<p>After all, Kay has been a reliable Bush loyalist, and that hasn?t changed.</p>
<p>Kay?s real intention in addressing the Senate was to use the CIA as a scapegoat for the bad information that led to the war. Now, that the election is approaching, the President?s chief advisor, Karl Rove, is trying to put as much distance as he can between the White House and the myriad lies about the non-existent weapons.</p>
<p>This is a delicate situation and has to be handled with great subtlety or intelligence agencies will see that Bush is trying to bury them in the media. Hence, the appearance of David Kay is intended to reinforce the false notion that the war was the result of faulty intelligence. Kay?s testimony challenged the reliability of intelligence gathering methods and suggested that we may need a ?major overhaul? of the intelligence services.</p>
<p>Absent from the testimony was any detailed recounting of the many fabrications that were repeated with propaganda-like precision to support the war. Also, absent was the clear implication that the Administration was directly involved in ?cherry-picking? intelligence to suit its own purposes.</p>
<p>Apart from Senator Edward Kennedy, there was no mention of the fact that the Vice President was pressuring the CIA with frequent visits to produce information that was compatible with his own warmongering objectives, or that an Office of Special Plans was developed in the Pentagon for the expressed purpose of selectively manufacturing evidence that Saddam was a threat.</p>
<p>Most of this passed by completely unnoticed. Instead, the Administration has adroitly used its main inspector to ?move the shells? one more time, and shift the blame onto the undeserving CIA.</p>
<p>But, the CIA doesn?t create policy and it doesn?t make the decision to go to war; the President does.</p>
<p>The CIA was skeptical about the Iraq threat from the very beginning. Its reluctance to endorse the Bush preemptive policy was evident in an earlier report that clearly stated that a war in Iraq would increase the likelihood of terrorism in the region and, perhaps, force Saddam to give whatever weapons he had to terrorist organizations.</p>
<p>This warning was ignored.</p>
<p>It seems only appropriate that Kay would give his report on a day when six more American servicemen and eleven more Iraqis were killed. His loyalty to the Bush policy of unprovoked aggression provides an interesting contrast to the grim facts on the ground. Men and women are dying every day in what we know now was an entirely avoidable war.</p>
<p>The testimony of David Kay only confirms that point.</p>

<p>Alison Southwick: Just when you thought she was out of your life for good, it's Zombie Wife.</p>
<p>Robert Brokamp: This is the case of William Kennedy. Not part of the famous Kennedy family. This Kennedy worked for DuPont and participated in the company's retirement plan. In 1994 he and his wife, whose name was Liv, got divorced and in the agreement she waived any rights to his retirement plan.</p>
<p>Seven years later, William passes away. The money, however, was sent from the retirement plan to the wife. Why? Because William did not update the beneficiary form on his retirement plan. When you signed up for your 401(k) at work, you filled out the beneficiary form, but you also have that on IRAs. You have it on life insurance policies. There are all types of different assets and accounts in which you've filled out the beneficiary form.</p>
<p>He didn't update it, so the daughter who should have [or at least she thought] should have inherited the money took it to court. Went all the way to the Supreme Court in 2009. They decided for Liv, the ex-wife. She's the one who gets the $400,000.</p>
<p>Southwick: Oh, that's not bad! That's not too shabby.</p>
<p>Brokamp: No, not too bad. The lesson here is to review and update your beneficiary forms and include copies with all your other important papers.</p>

<article id="0000124" published-at="2011-08-11" title="Libya?s Ragtag Rebels"><p>Rebels, from the Wars of the Roses up to the present civil war in Libya, usually try to postpone splitting into factions and murdering each other until after they have seized power and are in full control. However deep their divisions, they keep them secret from the outside world.</p>
<p>Not so the Libyan rebels. Members of their Transitional National Council (TNC) in Benghazi last month detained their military leader, General Abdel Fatah Younes, on suspicion of treachery, lured him away from his bodyguards and murdered him. This week the head of the TNC, Mustafa Abdel Jalil, sacked his whole government on the grounds that some were complicit in the killing. He was apparently forced to do so in order to quell the rage of the powerful Obeidi tribe to which Younes belonged.</p>
<p>A ludicrous aspect of the whole affair is that at the very moment the rebel leaders are at each other?s throats, they are being recognised by country after country as the legitimate government of Libya. This week TNC diplomats took over the Libyan embassies in London and Washington and are about to do so in Ottawa. In a masterpiece of mistiming, Britain recognized the rebel government on the day when some of its members were shooting their own commander-in-chief and burning his body.</p>
<p>If this is how the rebels behave today, when it is much in their interests to make a show of unity, how will they act once they are installed in power in Tripoli? But NATO?s sole policy is to do just that. A UN Security Council resolution, intended to stop Gaddafi?s tanks taking Benghazi for humanitarian reasons in March, transmuted rapidly into a bid to overthrow him. Britain and France, with essential backing from the US, still maintain that the good of the Libyan people requires the replacement of Gaddafi with those sturdy democrats from Benghazi and eastern Libya represented by the TNC.</p>
<p>Could a strategy of brute force work in a purely military sense? Could the rebel columns of pick-up trucks with machine-guns in the back advance to capture Tripoli behind a creeping barrage supplied by NATO firepower? The Libyan capital is increasingly short of fuel, consumer goods and electricity.</p>
<p>The rebels have been making gains on the ground to the east and south-west of the capital. But even with the support of NATO air strikes the advance has been slow. If the rebels make such a meal of taking a town like Brega, with a population of 4,000, on the Gulf of Sirte, can they really fight their way into Tripoli with a population of 1.7 million?</p>
<p>Gaddafi may fall, but it looks increasingly that, if he does, it will be at the hands of a rag-tag collection of militias ever more dependent for success on being backed by tactical support from NATO aircraft. Given that the rebels lack a coherent leadership or a united military force, the outcome is unlikely to be a clear-cut victory. Even if victorious, the rebels will depend on foreign support at every level to exert authority over this vast country.</p>
<p>As with Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003, the US and Britain found it was one thing to overthrow the Taliban or Saddam Hussein and quite another to replace them. Treating dubious local allies as the legitimate government has a propaganda value, but it is unwise to pretend that the local partner carries real authority. With this experience under its belt, it required real fecklessness for Britain to plunge into another conflict on the assumption that this time we were betting on a certain winner. Gaddafi may be overthrown but the struggle for power between internal factions is likely to continue.</p>
<p>Colorful, but woefully misleading</p>
<p>The foreign media had its failings in Iraq, was worse in Afghanistan but has reached its nadir in covering the war in Libya. Reporting has become largely militarized. Much of it is colorful stuff from the frontline about the dashes backwards and forwards of rebel militiamen. It takes courage to report this and reporters naturally empathize with the young men with whom they are sharing a trench. Their coverage tends to be wholly in favor of the rebels and in opposition to Gaddafi.</p>
<p>When Abdel Fatah Younes was murdered almost nobody in the foreign media had an explanation as to how or why it had happened. The rebel leadership, previously portrayed as a heroic band of brothers, turned out to be split by murderous rivalries and vendettas. Some reporters simply regurgitated the rebel authorities? unlikely claim that the general had been killed by pro-Gaddafi fighters with camps in Benghazi, while others mentioned that there were 30 different Islamic militias in the city.</p>
<p>To this day politicians justify NATO?s intervention in Libya by citing atrocities supposedly carried out by pro-Gaddafi forces such as mass rape or extensive use of mercenaries. Human rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch long ago revealed that there was no evidence for most of the atrocity stories, as did a UN commission headed by the distinguished legal scholar Cherif Bassiouni. These well-researched reports were almost entirely ignored by the media which first published the Gaddafi atrocity stories.</p>
<p>The militarization of reporting in Iraq and Afghanistan was boosted by the system of ?embedding? reporters with military units. This was inevitable to a degree given the danger from Iraqi insurgents or Taliban. But the outcome has been that war reporting has reverted to what it was during imperial skirmishes in the 19th century, with the world getting only a partial and often misleading account of what is happening in Libya.</p>

<article id="0000126" published-at="2003-06-14" title="State may try to curb sex abuse secrecy"><p></p>
<p>COLUMBUS (OH)Telegraph-ForumBy Jim SiegelT-F Columbus Bureau&amp;#160;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>COLUMBUS -- The Catholic Church has taken steps to stop the secrecy that allowed priests to commit unreported sex crimes against children, and now the state might take its turn.</p>
<p>"Too many times -- and a lot of lawsuits have come about in the last few years -- people who have known about the accusations have not done anything about them," said Sen. Robert Spada, R-North Royalton. "It is a sad situation."</p>
<p>Spada has introduced a bill requiring clergy to report any knowledge of child abuse to law enforcement or children's services, placing church leaders in the same category under state law as other professions such as doctors, nurses and school employees.</p>
<p>He also hopes to clarify the statute of limitations on such crimes, ensuring that the 20-year clock would not start until either the crime is reported or the victim reaches age 18.</p>
<p>Since March 2002, nationwide child sex abuse allegations involving Catholic priests have led to changes in the way such situations are handled by the church. At least 225 of the nation's more than 46,000 Roman Catholic priests have either been dismissed from their duties or resigned as a result of accusations.</p>
<p>"At this point, it appears to be a pretty good bill," Jim Tobin, associate director of the Catholic Conference of Ohio, said of Spada's proposal.</p></article>
<article id="0000128" published-at="2017-12-05" title="Trump admin silent on possible move of U.S. embassy to Jerusalem"><p>Dec. 5 (UPI) ? President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/" type="external">Donald Trump</a> appears to have missed a Monday deadline to decide on moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, as he faces growing warnings from Middle East leaders.</p>
<p>The deadline to announce the embassy?s possible move from Tel Aviv was pushed from Friday to Monday. However, that passed without any official word from the Trump administration.</p>
<p>The president is facing more warnings from U.S. and foreign leaders over the repercussions of the potential move, including Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo?an, Palestinian President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Mahmoud_Abbas/" type="external">Mahmoud Abbas</a> and Saudi Arabian officials.</p>
<p>Erdo?an <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-42232158" type="external">described the status of Jerusalem</a> as a ?red line? for Muslims and warned the embassy move could lead to Ankara cutting ties with Israel.</p>
<p>?If the status of Jerusalem is changed and another step is taken ? that would be a major catastrophe,? Bekir Bozda?, Turkey?s deputy prime minister, said. ?It would completely destroy the fragile peace process in the region, and lead to new conflicts, new disputes and new unrest.?</p>
<p>The European Union cautioned there could be ?serious repercussions.?</p>
<p>Some officials warn that the relocation could delay the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Abul Gheit, an Arab League leader, said it could pose a threat ?to the stability of the Middle East and the whole world.?</p>
<p>French President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Emmanuel-Macron/" type="external">Emmanuel Macron</a> told Trump that Jerusalem?s status must be decided ?within the framework of negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.?</p>
<p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/05/trump-misses-deadline-moving-us-embassy-jerusalem" type="external">said Palestinians</a> would ?walk away from contacts with U.S. officials? if Jerusalem is declared the capital.</p>
<p>If the United States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital, it would be the first country to do so since the creation of Israel in 1948.</p></article>
<article id="0000133" published-at="2014-11-10" title="This Syrian girl's exile has stretched from weeks to years"><p>Karen, a 13-year-old living in a noisy&amp;#160;suburb of Beirut, already has her future figured out.</p>
<p>?I want to be a famous engineer or a scientist,? she says. That's&amp;#160;why she loves building 3D puzzles. ?It makes me feel that I?m an engineer or something.?</p>
<p>The hallway of the apartment where she lives with her parents and 6-year-old sister is decorated with a few of the&amp;#160;puzzles: a Chinese pagoda, an Italian basilica&amp;#160;and an English castle.</p>
<p>But she hasn?t seen the rest of her collection&amp;#160;in two years. Those&amp;#160;puzzles are almost 200 miles away, in the home where Karen used to live in the city of Aleppo, Syria.</p>
<p>When she thinks back to her time in Aleppo, it's&amp;#160;a wash of pleasant memories.&amp;#160;?When my grandma was alive, we used to have parties or eat dinner together," Karen says. "In every place in Aleppo, there was a small garden so that people can go there and have a break. I had many activities, [like] ballet, chess, piano ? It was fun. I never got bored.?</p>
<p>Then there are the memories from&amp;#160;early 2012, when Karen was 12.</p>
<p>?I remember the first bomb,? she says. ?We were at school and we suddenly heard a sound. All of us shook and fell down. I [will] never forget that.?</p>
<p>The civil war between the Syrian government and rebel forces had reached Aleppo.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>?After a week, [there was] another bomb," Karen says.&amp;#160;"And then&amp;#160;we got used to it. Guns and bombs. But they were far away. We were safe.?</p>
<p>School was in session everyday. The bus came every morning, but kidnappings were routine.&amp;#160;?My biggest fear was to lose my dolls or something because I was still a little girl,? Karen says.</p>

<p>Getting out</p>
<p>Karen?s parents did what they could to shield their two daughters from a city that was crumbling around them. But in&amp;#160;July of 2012, her father explained they were going on a trip.&amp;#160;?Get ready. We?re going for a week or two weeks to Lebanon," he said.</p>
<p>Karen had been to Lebanon before, going&amp;#160;with her family to visit relatives and see the&amp;#160;eye doctor, but this trip was different from the start. The first leg&amp;#160;was a 30-minute nighttime flight from Aleppo to Damascus. The plane was roaring down the runway ? and then&amp;#160;came to a grinding halt.</p>
<p>The flight attendants told the passengers to close their window shades.&amp;#160;?The [guy] sitting next to my dad,&amp;#160;his window was open a little bit, so my dad saw that there was a helicopter," Karen says. "And it was shooting.?</p>
<p>?It was night,&amp;#160;so you could see the bullets flying both ways, up and down," remembers Harout, Karen's father.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, the plane took off.</p>
<p>Karen and her family spent the night in Damascus. They met a taxi first thing in the morning and&amp;#160;made the six-hour drive to&amp;#160;Beirut ?&amp;#160;twice as long as usual. Karen slept for most of the ride, but at some point she remembers looking out the window. She knew she was in Lebanon because the scenery had changed.</p>
<p>?[There were] beautiful flowers, trees,? she remembers. ?It was green. I only [saw] the sky?and green mountains.</p>
<p>Three weeks in Beirut came and went. Things back in Aleppo deteriorated even further. Her parents finally admitted they were staying in Beirut, for at least a couple of years.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>?There was no way to go back,? says Nazig, Karen?s mother. ?We were not happy with this decision, but we had to take it. The kids were our first concern.?</p>
<p>It's&amp;#160;decision many Syrians have had to make. According to the <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/" type="external">UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a>, there are at least 1.1 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon. That's a&amp;#160;quarter of the population of Lebanon itself, and the UN's count is likely low. Just last month, Lebanon said it cannot accept any more people from Syria.</p>

<p>A new home</p>
<p>Karen misses her cousins. She was especially close to her cousin Anne, but Karen&amp;#160;doesn't know how she's doing because the telephone and Internet connections in Syria are poor.</p>
<p>But aside from missing family ?&amp;#160;some have fled to other countries ?&amp;#160;the move to Beirut has been largely positive for Karen. Her family is Armenian Christian, and she adores her new Armenian school here.</p>
<p>?I have the best friends,? she says. ?They?re just like sisters and brothers. And I am popular in here, thank God. And the teachers are really good.?</p>
<p>The school has let Karen immerse herself in science, and her English has improved dramatically. But Karen is not planning to stay in Lebanon forever ?&amp;#160;nor does she want to return to live in Syria.</p>
<p>?I won?t feel the fun that I used to feel when I was a little girl," she says. "Of course I will be happy to go visit Aleppo, but not stay there.?</p>
<p>When Karen thinks about Syria, she hopes ?that peace will come. Each Syrian ?&amp;#160;me, my family, every Syrian ?&amp;#160;has hope that Syria will get better. Hope is the key of winning your dream.?</p>
<p>After all, Karen says, ?a little hope is healthy.?</p>

<article id="0000134" published-at="2011-04-18" title="U.K. Courts to Journalists: Stow It"><p>Parliamentary official John Hemming has drawn attention to a new type of court order forbidding members of Britain?s fourth estate to cover cases deemed too sensitive for public consideration. The order, known as a super-injunction, promises legal consequences ? including possible jail time ? for journalists daring to ask the wrong questions or even report a restriction?s existence.</p>
<p>Details on the injunction that prompted Hemming?s criticism were not forthcoming. ? ARK</p>
<p>The Guardian:</p>
<p>An MP who is launching an inquiry into excessive and possibly unlawful court secrecy says a new type of gagging order is hampering the work of investigative journalists.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>John Hemming said the new breed of injunction, which was used in relation to a case in the high court in London last week, meant journalists could face jail simply for asking questions.</p>
<p>This goes a step further than preventing people speaking out against injustice,? said Hemming, the Liberal Democrat MP for Birmingham Yardley and a longtime campaigner against secrecy. ?It has the effect of preventing journalists from speaking to people subject to this injunction without a risk of the journalist going to jail. That is a recipe for hiding miscarriages of justice.?</p>
<p>? There has been growing concern over the use of gagging orders in UK courts. It is not known precisely how many superinjunctions have been issued, but an informed legal estimate is that as many as 20 have been granted in the UK over the last 18 months.</p>

<p>THE inmate accused of strangling John Geoghan in his prison cell hated homosexuals and began plotting the attack on the child-molesting former priest weeks ago, a prosecutor said."He looked upon Father Geoghan as a prize," District Attorney John J.

<p>Geoghan, 68, was killed while serving a nine- to 10-year sentence for assault and battery on a 10-year-old boy. He had been in protective custody since being transferred to the maximum security prison in April, officials said.</p>

<article id="0000138" published-at="2016-09-22" title="Why Steelcase, Inc. Stock Popped Today"><p></p>
<p>Image source: Steelcase, Inc.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>Shares of Steelcase, Inc. (NYSE: SCS) rose 12.8% Thursday after the office furniture specialist released weaker-than-expected fiscal second-quarter 2017 results, but offered encouraging guidance for a return to growth going forward.</p>
<p>Quarterly revenue fell 7% year over year, to $758 million, and translated to net income of $38.2 million, or $0.31 per diluted share. Excluding restructuring charges, Steelcase's net income fell 8.6% year over year, to $0.32 per diluted share. By contrast, Steelcase's outlook called for revenue in the range of $770 million to $795 million, but roughly the same earnings per share (on both a GAAP and adjusted basis) in the range of $0.29 to $0.33.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Steelcase CEO Jim Keane explained that July orders fell 8% in the Americas, leading to lower overall revenue than anticipated. But Keane also added:</p>
<p>More specifically, Steelcase expects fiscal third-quarter revenue of $795 million to $820 million, including organic revenue growth of 1% to 4%. On the bottom line, Steelcase expects third-quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.32 to $0.36, including a $0.01 per-share negative impact from restructuring costs.</p>
<p>By contrast, analysts' consensus estimates predicted Steelcase would achieve revenue of $807.4 million in the quarter, and adjusted earnings of $0.35 per share.</p>
<p>Of course, that guidance wasn't overwhelmingly positive, and more than anything confirmed what Wall Street was hoping to hear. So in light of its relative underperformance in Q2, it's somewhat surprising to see shares of Steelcase climb so much in today's trading. To be fair, however, it's worth noting shares are still down more than 20% over the past year, indicating perhaps investors were were willing to buy Steelcase stock in light of any perceived turning point for the company.</p>
<p>In the end, while I'm not personally anxious to dive in and buy Steelcase stock today, I think it's worth adding to your watch list to keep tabs on its progress.</p>

<article id="0000143" published-at="2018-11-20" title="Study: 30% of CA police killings not reported to state"><p>California won national applause in September when Attorney General Kamala Harris announced the implementation of a new online system under which all California police agencies will have to report not just fatal police shootings but encounters in which civilians are seriously injured by officers trying to subdue them. The reporting program is named <a href="https://ursusdemo.doj.ca.gov/welcome" type="external">URSUS</a> in a nod to the grizzly bear, California?s official animal.</p>
<p>Harris received highly positive coverage in such publications as <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-09-22/california-launches-first-statewide-system-to-track-police-use-of-force" type="external">U.S. News and World Report</a> for her declaration that it was long overdue for there to be ?an honest, transparent and data-driven conversation about police use of force.? U.S. News also depicted Assemblyman Freddie Rodriguez, D-Pomona, as a visionary for coming up with the idea in 2014.</p>
<p>Harris and Rodriguez may end up amply deserving credit if they do usher in a new era in which statistical tools illustrate the extent of police misconduct. But little of the coverage of URSUS focuses on the question of incentives within law enforcement agencies. As Harvard law professor <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/02/opinion/controlling-the-cops-accomplices-to-perjury.html" type="external">Alan Dershowitz</a> and many others have written over the past 40 years, police of all ranks have many reasons to create tidy narratives about their actions.</p>
<p>Officers have an incentive to not report their violent incidents and to depict injuries suffered by suspects as not their fault; the other officers who witness such violence have an incentive to not report or to inaccurately depict such injuries because of a police culture with a still-strong ?code of silence?; and police chiefs and top police brass have an incentive to not accurately report incidents within their ranks because of concerns on how it would reflect on them and their departments.</p>
<p>This long history of police not acting to limit misconduct is a factor in the huge gap between African American and white perceptions of police misconduct, according to <a href="http://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/legitimacy/pages/welcome.aspx" type="external">recent research</a> by the U.S. Justice Department?s Office of Justice.</p>
<p>Now the San Francisco Chronicle, <a href="http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Gaps-in-SF-state-counts-of-police-killings-10154853.php" type="external">analyzing research</a> done by Texas State University covering the years from 2006-2015, has given an example of how the incentives for police to resist oversight have resulted in a lax police culture in California.</p>
<p>A state law adopted long before the controversies over police killings in New York City, Baltimore and Cleveland requires local law enforcement to report fatal shootings by officers to the state government.</p>
<p>But the Chronicle?s analysis found it to be broadly ignored over the 10 years of data compiled by Texas State University researchers. Some of the key findings:</p>
<p>The Chronicle?s data suggests California law enforcement agencies may be getting better at reporting such fatal shootings. The 10-year average of unreported police killings was 30 percent. Last year, the percentage appears to be closer to 25 percent, though exact numbers are not yet available.</p>
<p>But in San Francisco, the percentage of unreported police killings in 2015 was 100 percent. The Chronicle said city police officials didn?t notify the state of any of the six police killings last year.</p></article>
<article id="0000145" published-at="2016-03-06" title="The Biggest Misunderstanding About Shopify"><p></p>
<p>This week Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) reported a 93% jump in revenue compared to last year. It went public back in May and has seen its stock jump 86% since. That?s because Shopify (and its many competitors, from Magento to Bigcommerce) are considered to be the future of e-commerce for small retailers. And that?s true. But there?s also something else bigger than just e-commerce.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>That?s because applications like Shopify will be just as important to those many retailers where e-commerce isn?t as big a factor. And for those retailers, moving to this technology will be the difference not just for a successful holiday season but for long term survival as well.</p>
<p>A small, real-life example. There is a pharmacy located in my neighborhood that has been around since the mid-1950?s. It?s a family business and it provides a livelihood for its owners. And every day I watch this little pharmacy slowly die. No, they don?t have an e-commerce presence ? they barely have a website. But that?s not the real reason why they?re dying. &amp;#160;It?s because they?re getting crushed by larger competitors, a CVS (NYSE:CVS) and a Rite-Aid (NYSE:RAD) which is being acquired by Walgreen?s (NYSE:WAG), are each located a mile away. And yet, this little pharmacy doesn?t have to fail. It can compete against the big box stores. It can become vibrant and relevant and successful. They need the kind of technology that a Shopify has.</p>
<p>Shopify and its competitors aren?t just e-commerce. They are mobile point-of-sale, payment and inventory management applications that are dovetailed with e-commerce. And that?s the big misunderstanding about applications like these.</p>
<p>They are designed to be used both in-house and online. Shopify?s unlimited plan, which is less than $200 per month, will enable the little pharmacist down the street to take a big jump into the 21st century. Online, he can setup his own store where customers can search, order and pay for unlimited products for either delivery or pickup ? a critical customer service in today?s attention-deficit-disorder world. But it?s in the store where products like Shopify will have the most impact.</p>
<p>The application is designed for the iPad so that store employees, and yes even the pharmacist himself, can come out from behind the counter, walk the aisle and engage with customers face to face, helping them search for the right product, taking orders and even receiving payment. The application lets him offer gift cards and discount codes. If implemented the right way its inventory and reporting will allow the pharmacist to stay on top of his stock and analyze which products are moving the best. And I?m really just scratching the surface. This is all in-house stuff, not online. And we?re not getting this at the big box places. It?s a value-add that any smart business owner can do to strengthen his relationship with his customers and community.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>And there?s more technology for that that the brick-and-mortar retailer, like my pharmacist friend, to help him succeed.</p>
<p>For example, he can use a free service called Happy E-Mail to make sure his customers are getting a special e-mail thank you from him after they?ve made their purchase. Or a specially designed purchase receipt from Receiptful that upsells on future items. Another free product called Limespot will prompt sales associates of opportunities to recommend other related products and accessories while still engaging with the customer in the store. A product called Sweet Tooth will offer customers points for their loyalty which they can use for discounts on future sales. These are just a few of the hundreds of apps available to enhance the in-store experience.</p>
<p>And that?s the biggest misunderstanding: e-commerce and brick-and-mortar are becoming the same. &amp;#160;All retailers who want to grow will use technology like Shopify for both online and in-store. The store employee and the online visitor is searching the same inventory database. The loyalty programs and e-mail confirmations are being triggered whether the purchase is made in-store or via the web. Because of the cloud there?s no such thing as two systems ? it?s all one system. It?s all mobile. And it?s all pretty inexpensive, even for the small retailer.</p>
<p>So here?s what I would tell him to do: invest. Hire someone short-term to help (Shopify has a marketplace of experts and even more can be found on sites like UpWork). Move all inventory on to a platform like Shopify. Buy a few iPads from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and link to a few good loyalty and communication services. And get his employees walking around the store helping customers face to face. And don?t worry about ecommerce, because that?s part of the package. It?s all the same. It?s all one system. And it?s there to help him provide a much better service to his customers than the big chains down the street.</p></article>

<p>Tens of thousands of travelers have missed their flights in recent months as wait times at checkpoints exceeded two hours at busy hubs in places like Chicago and Seattle. And there?s another pressing reason to fix the problem: big crowds at airports are potential targets for terrorists as recent attacks in Brussels, and now, Istanbul, have shown.</p>
<p>While Congress quickly gave TSA money to bring in reinforcements after lines spilled out of terminals, the fix that has the best chance of succeeding in the long run, experts say, is to get PreCheck enrollment into high gear.</p>
<p>MorphoTrust already has a contract with the TSA to bring millions of new members into PreCheck so they can keep their shoes on and their laptops stored as they whisk through security. But TSA believes that burden is too much for one company to handle and it?s been trying since 2013 to bring in more private sector vendors to join the effort to boost enrollments from 3 million today to 25 million by 2019, when 50 percent of all fliers would get the express treatment.</p>
<p>According to those familiar with the bidding process thus far, the aim is to make it as easy to sign up for PreCheck as it is to purchase a product online, while maintaining the integrity of the vetting process.</p>
<p>But since January, MorphoTrust has been fighting back.</p>
<p>First, the company filed what?s known as a ?bid protest? that basically stopped TSA from issuing awards to more companies. When that protest was overruled by the TSA and the Government Accountability Office, MorphoTrust sued the government in federal claims court. While the legal process drags on, TSA is effectively blocked from issuing the new contracts and reaping the benefits this could bring.</p>
<p>?It is frankly bizarre,? said Robert Poole, director of transportation policy for the Reason Foundation, who has followed TSA since its inception after the 9/11 attacks. ?It would be tragic for air travelers if this gets held up for another year or two.?</p>
<p>MorphoTrust, for its part, says the TSA is using ?unlawful and irrational? methods to obtain new screening services, which, it says, it can already provide. It accused the agency of circumventing normal contracting procedures to evade scrutiny by Congress and the public, claiming that TSA?s plan is so flawed that it could open up new gaps in aviation security. TSA has until July 22 to respond to the charges, but it has already said publicly that it must get more help from the private sector and it can?t follow traditional contracting rules to do so.</p>
<p>MorphoTrust, a longtime provider of identity verification services, has $20 million in revenue at stake, according to its court filing. It?s owned by French tech and aerospace giant Safran.</p>
<p>Seven companies are reportedly competing for what TSA says will be at least three contracts. While TSA won?t release the names of the bidders, one of them is reportedly Clear, a private sector line-cutting service already has dedicated lanes for its membership plan at 13 U.S. airports. Delta Air Lines recently acquired a 5 percent stake in Clear, and it and other travel companies are getting increasingly impatient with the slow pace of progress.</p>
<p>Start and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.</p>
<p>A speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).</p>
<p>?It is very frustrating,? said a source at a company that is in the running, who asked not to be named. ?It is unfortunate that this monopolistic vendor is basically holding the U.S. traveling public hostage.?</p>
<p>MorphoTrust declined to comment on the details of the pending litigation but said through a spokesman: ?Our protest doesn?t have anything to do with an objection to expansion; it is about a technical issue with the way the procurement was handled.? The spokesperson added that MorphoTrust is working to reduce a backlog in PreCheck applications and is adding dozens of enrollment centers not just in airports but in storefront locations like H&amp;amp;R Block offices.</p>
<p>MorphoTrust aside, several sources close to the situation, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject, said that TSA shares much of the blame, for, among other things, taking too long to approve new enrollment centers and getting security clearances for employees manning them. Those are just two of a string of stumbles that led to the continuing fiasco at airport checkpoints.</p>
<p>A Delay Two Decades in the Making</p>
<p>The story dates back to the beginnings of TSA in 2001, when Congress mandated that the nascent agency establish a ?trusted passenger? program to give low-risk travelers expedited treatment so screeners could focus their attention on fliers who might merit more scrutiny. For more than a decade TSA struggled with how to meet that goal, rolling out a series of failed schemes; they ranged from the comically ineffectual (?Black Diamond? lanes for ?expert? travelers, dreamed up by a TSA chief who liked to ski) to the downright creepy, with a far-fetched plan to tap credit rating firms for personal information to establish a vast database on all passengers (who would be given ?threat scores? for a good measure).</p>
<p>Finally, TSA in 2011 came up with PreCheck, which it believed would be less controversial since it was voluntary. The idea would be to give fliers who submitted to a background check and fingerprinting a sort of ?screening lite? at airports that, like EZ Pass lanes at toll plazas, would make everything move more efficiently.</p>
<p>TSA didn?t have the resources to jumpstart the plan so it selected MorphoTrust to set up a network of enrollment services; after all, the company was working under contract with TSA, performing vetting services for things like a transportation worker ID program. Morpho?s role has been mainly a passive one: collecting the application forms and obtaining fingerprints, which are passed on to the TSA, so the data can be run through the FBI?s criminal background check apparatus.</p>
<p>TSA made its first blunder with PreCheck at inception by announcing a goal of having 25 percent of all air travelers using the speedy lanes by the end of 2013. It soon became clear that wasn?t going to happen: after an initial surge of interest, PreCheck enrollment proceeded at a desultory pace. Maybe it was the required in-person appearance at a TSA-approved center, or the $85 fee for five-year membership, but whatever the reason, sign-ups fell below expectations.</p>
<p>?This disastrous enrollment process is producing a chokepoint? that?s depriving millions of travelers of the benefits of PreCheck, said Kevin Mitchell, who heads the Business Travel Coalition. He added that these express security lanes produce on average three times the passenger throughput as regular security lines.</p>
<p>But TSA instead saw another way to reach that 25 percent goal: reel in passengers who were not part of PreCheck, but who popped up as low-risk in the routine assessments TSA gives to all passengers before flight time. (That?s under something called Secure Flight, which is why you provide your date of birth and exact legal name when you book a flight.) The number of people using the lines exploded by 300 percent.</p>
<p>?It was a fiasco,? Poole said, with clueless passengers clogging the lanes and slowing things down for everyone. And when an infamous 1970s terrorist, Sara Jane Olsen, was waved into a PreCheck lane by a screener (over objections from another TSA agent who recognized the former fugitive) this one too bit the dust.</p>
<p>TSA committed a far greater sin in December 2014 when it issued a formal request for proposals. Buried in the details was a request that bidders provide ?risk scoring algorithms using commercial data, including social media and purchase information.? Many saw that as giving TSA and its surrogates carte blanche to scour the internet for personal, and potentially damning information. Privacy rights advocates pounced, and in February 2015, TSA issued a terse announcement withdrawing the bid request.</p>
<p>It took another eight months for TSA to issue a new one, which pointedly says that bidders will be barred from using any available social media for pre-screening efforts. Commercial databases, however, can be used, and that touches on what some observers say is a legitimate question as TSA struggles with the next step: What are these databases and how can one be assured the information they contain is accurate?</p>
<p>Chris Calabrese, senior policy director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, said in a letter to TSA that the enrollment expansion raises some serious privacy concerns.</p>
<p>?What will the public know about which data is ingested and how it is weighted?? he asked.</p>
<p>Poole said that another reason behind the delay is TSA?s own ingrained resistance to anything that could be perceived?fairly or not?as easing up on security.</p>
<p>?There are these factions within TSA that are opposed to going forward with this PreCheck expansion,? he said.</p>
<p>A source inside the aviation security sector put it more bluntly.</p>
<p>?It?s the CYA syndrome. If they?re dumbing this down, what if something happened? No one wants to have anything bad happen on their watch.? And for all TSA gets criticized for imposing a needless ?security theater? travelers, thus far there has been no successful terror attack on a U.S. airplane since 9/11.</p>
<p>So where does this leave the millions of travelers facing absurdly long waits at checkpoints this summer? Unless TSA gets the technical help to enable many more people to sign up in more convenient locations like downtown shopping areas, or to complete more of the process online, it could take more than seven years to reach the target at the current pace.</p>
<p>Adding more staff on the frontlines has helped somewhat, but, according to the TSA?s crowd-sourced ?My TSA? app, passengers recently were still posting waits of more than one hour at peak times at major airports. (TSA is reportedly working on a more accurate mechanism for disseminating real-time waits instead of relying on passengers to do so.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, passengers should expect a long summer and then some.</p>
<p>In early June, when the agency?s chief, Peter Neffenger, testified before the Senate on how TSA was handling the epic waits at checkpoints, he referred to the ongoing request for bids and said he expected to award PreCheck enrollment contracts by the end of this year, six months later than the most recent deadline. And with a court decision on Morpho?s suit not expected before the middle of October?or later, if there?s an appeal?airports could be choked from Thanksgiving through Christmas and right on into next year.</p></article>
<article id="0000150" published-at="2018-07-14" title="Taylor Armstrong of ?Real Housewives of Beverly Hills?: The Lawsuit"><p>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Taylor Armstrong is hoping the years of physical abuse she says she suffered at the hands of her late husband, Russell Armstrong, will get her out of a <a href="/content/dailybeast/articles/2011/09/15/russell-taylor-armstrong-s-business-associates-friends-on-financial-legal-troubles.html" type="external">$1.5 million lawsuit</a> in Los Angeles Superior Court.</p>
<p>The suit, filed in July by MyMedicalRecords.com, a company in which Russell Armstrong once held a controlling interest, charges that he pocketed investor money with Taylor Armstrong?s assistance. Through his company, NuWay Digital Services, Russell Armstrong owned 60 percent of MMR?s stock and, allegedly with Taylor often at his side, raised investor capital for the startup. The lawsuit alleges that Russell Armstrong was eventually ousted from MMR for his ?self dealing? through a legal settlement in which he paid the company $250,000.But the settlement agreement called for Russell Armstrong to relinquish all of his shares in MMR and for both Russell and Taylor Armstrong to disclose every investor from whom they had gotten money. The settlement included a ?damages? clause for monetary penalties to be levied if more investors with legitimate claims surfaced.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Russell and Taylor Armstrong failed to disclose the identities of three investors, entitling MMR to $1.5 million. But Taylor Armstrong maintains she was ?never aware of the investors? who purchased NDS or MMR shares through her late husband and ?as such, she neither negligently nor intentionally withheld the identity of any alleged investor from MMR.? She also states that her late husband threatened her with physical harm if she didn?t sign the agreement.</p>
<p>Russell Armstrong committed suicide Aug. 15, two weeks after MMR filed the lawsuit, leaving his wife of nearly six years to fight the Delaware corporation alone in court. A routine hearing in the case will take place today; the trial has been set for July 11.</p>
<p>Here?s a look at the seven most interesting claims in the lawsuit, as recorded in the court file reviewed by The Daily Beast.</p>
<p>1) According to the July 29 complaint, Taylor Armstrong ?held herself out as being a member of the Ford Family? and claimed that her prestigious relatives were major investors in MyMedicalRecords.com and NuWay Digital Services as a way of luring new investors.</p>
<p>2) Court documents allege that Russell and Taylor Armstrong ?successfully and secretly? funneled money that should have been paid to MMR to their own accounts so that they could ?live a lavish life-style, redecorate their mansion and become business colleagues of [actress] Eva Longoria in an upscale restaurant.?</p>
<p>3) When Russell Armstrong was ousted from MMR, he and Taylor Armstrong agreed to pay $250,000, according to the complaint. The company used the sum to settle scores with people who had invested in NDS only to have their money filtered to the Armstrongs? accounts. ?In order to preserve its reputation in the community, MMR has gone to extraordinary measures to exchange the NDS shares or other ?investments? with shares in MMR, so that those people who paid money to NDS, loaned money to Russell, Taylor and NDS or provided personal services to Russell and Taylor and NDS in exchange for payment in shares of MMR in fact receive the interest in MMR that they were promised.?</p>
<p>4) In her declaration, Taylor Armstrong denies having had any business dealings with MyMedicalRecords.com or being an officer, shareholder, or employee of her husband.</p>
<p>5) Taylor Armstrong admits that Russell Armstrong paid $250,000 to MMR ?to settle all disputes? but alleges that she was forced to sign the agreement under duress and threat of physical harm: ?I was under the threat of physical abuse from my late husband if I did not sign the settlement agreement ? and my late husband had caused me such severe physical harm before that I took his threats seriously.? But MMR charges that Taylor Armstrong has not provided a ?scintilla of evidence? to prove that her husband forced her to enter the agreement and that, even if he did, she has not proven that MMR had knowledge of the alleged duress.</p>
<p>6) Taylor Armstrong has petitioned the court for a ?protective order? that would keep all of her discovery responses out of the public eye because she does not want her ?personal contact information and biographical information to be made public.? She also is asking that information relating to the abusive treatment by her late husband should not be divulged to the public.</p>
<p>7) MMR is fighting the protective order by citing Taylor Armstrong?s memoir, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1451677715/thedaibea-20" type="external">Hiding From Reality</a>, and the <a href="/content/dailybeast/articles/2012/02/07/real-housewife-taylor-armstrong-tells-all-or-does-she.html" type="external">many media interviews</a> she has done about her abusive marriage. ?Taylor has taken it upon herself to extensively publicize the abuse by her [late] husband ? Taylor has disseminated the very facts she wishes to have protected by protective order. Taylor is clearly using the sensitive nature of these facts as a guise to obtain a protective order as to all discovery ? Unlike stage or screen actors, who play a ?part? or a ?role,? Taylor has chosen to play ?herself? on a reality program. She has chosen to release juicy ?tidbits? about her life for public consumption and to increase ratings. So, from any legitimate perspective, it is impossible to determine what type of ?private? information has or has not been released about Taylor, or for that matter, how this ?private? information has embarrassed her. Stated otherwise, Taylor cannot have her case and eat it at the expense of the plaintiff.?</p></article>
<article id="0000153" published-at="2011-08-25" title="Experts Warn to Get Prepared for a New Madrid Quake"><p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fox17.com/newsroom/top_stories/videos/wztv_vid_8993.shtml?wap=0" type="external">HERE</a> Local officials say a fault line in Tennessee could lead to a catostrophic earthquake here and your family should be prepared. Back in the 1800s, quakes along the New Madrid Fault were powerful enough to reverse the flow of the Mississippi River. Experts say the state will experience another major earthquake. It?s just a matter of when. Tennesseans with relatives in Virginia, D.C. and New York have been getting first hand accounts of what the 5.8 magnitude earthquake felt like.</p>
<p>?It was unbelieveable, from so far away,? says Maria Yankowski, mother in law of FOX17 Photographer Jeremy Briant. ?The way it hit it felt like it was right here.?</p>
<p>Yankowski was having lunch in Staton Island when the quake hit.</p>
<p>?The whole table was shaking,? says Yankowski. ?I looked up and everythign was shaking on the ceiling. The woman next to me said ?Oh, my goodness, we?re having a tornado?.?</p>
<p>Officials at Tennessee Emergency Management are monitoring the damage in Virginia. In the 1800s Tennessee experienced one of the largest earthquakes on record along the New Madrid Fault Line. Last month TEMA participated in one of the country?s largest earthquake disaster drills.</p>
<p>?We learned about things and what the gaps were, what we need to work on logistically and communication, things like that,? says TEMA Director of Planning Cecil Whaley. ?We?re much more prepared now than we were 10 years ago.?</p>
<p>Experts say a major earthquake along the New Madrid Fault would be potentially felt by over 3 million people in 8-12 states.</p>
<p>?It?s not connected to the New Madrid Fault and we don?t think it will cause anything that will affect New Madrid, but what it does tell us is that we need to be prepared,? says Whaley. ?What we?re seeing now, Virginia was kind of caught off guard, especially around the Virginia area, and we don?t want to be caught off guard.?</p>
<p>The last big earthquake to hit this area was in 1811. Experts say every 200-500 years, the plates erupt along the seismic zone, and it?s been exactly 200 years.</p>

Singapore?s central bank on Tuesday said it had permanently barred Yeo Jiawei, a former wealth manager of Swiss bank BSI involved in breaches related to Malaysia?s 1MDB fund, from managing financial services firms and advisory activities.</p>
<p>In July, a Singapore court jailed Yeo for 4-1/2 years for money laundering and cheating in a case linked to investigations into the siphoning of billions of dollars from Malaysian sovereign fund 1MDB.</p>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore said it has issued a permanent prohibition order against Yeo, effective Monday, and a three-year ban for former chief executive of financial advisory firm NRA Capital, Kevin Scully.</p>
<p>?NRA had been appointed to perform the valuation of PetroSaudi Oil Services Limited (PSOSL),? MAS said in a press release.</p>
<p>?Mr Scully had failed to ensure that NRA?s valuation of PSOSL was carried out with sufficient care, judgment and objectivity,? the central bank added.</p>

<article id="0000157" published-at="2015-12-11" title="A Carbon Levy Is Possible for Big Fossil Fuel Firms"><p>By Henner Weithoener / Climate News Network</p>
<p>&amp;#160;Fossil fuel production, as at this German mine, casts a long shadow. (Loracco via Wikimedia Commons)</p>
<p>This Creative Commons-licensed piece first appeared at <a href="http://climatenewsnetwork.net/carbon-levy-mooted-for-big-fossil-fuel-firms/" type="external">Climate News Network</a>.</p>
<p>PARIS ? Big Oil (and its gas and coal counterparts) could before long face paying for the carbon contained in the fuel they sell. Two groups working for a cleaner future want to see a levy imposed on fossil fuel exploitation.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A 2013 report said almost two-thirds of the main greenhouse gas going into the atmosphere, carbon dioxide, came from the fuels produced by a mere 90 companies. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) summit here is in the final hours of its attempt to broker a just and effective global treaty on reducing those emissions and limiting their impacts: extreme weather, drought, flooding, sea level rise, land and forest degradation, desertification.</p>
<p>Pressure is growing to work out if and how these big fossil fuel producers can be held financially responsible for the damage their products are causing.</p>
<p>The 90 fossil fuel companies responsible for 63% of CO2 emissions from human activities are a roll call of household names, including Chevron, ExxonMobil, Saudi Aramco, BP, Gazprom and Shell.</p>
<p>Now the Climate Justice Programme and the Heinrich Boell Foundation are urging that producers should pay a carbon levy on all fossil fuel extraction and mining, with the proceeds going to help pay poorer countries for adapting to climate change and meeting the costs of its impacts.</p>
<p>Phase-out needed</p>
<p>The levy would be applied to both the exploitation and the burning of fossil fuels. If a company was involved in both, it would have to pay the levy only once.</p>
<p>It would charge the carbon majors US$2 for every tonne of carbon dioxide their products release into the atmosphere. In 2014 this would have meant $50 billion coming from the companies.</p>
<p>The levy is based on a calculation of how much CO2 is released on average from burning a barrel of crude oil (or a tonne of coal, or a cubic metre of natural gas). The CO2 footprint of the drilling or mining itself would not be taken into account.</p>
<p>?We propose that a global fossil fuel extraction levy be established and paid into the international Loss and Damage Mechanism. This funding would be used to assist the poorest and most vulnerable communities suffering the worst impacts of climate change?, said Julie-Anne Richards of the Climate Justice Programme. ?This levy needs to be part of a general phase-out of fossil fuels.?</p>
<p>Precedents</p>
<p>The UNFCCC?s Loss and Damage Mechanism emerged from the 2013 climate summit in Warsaw. It is a way to address those climate impacts to which it is impossible to adapt, including extreme events.</p>
<p>?Climate finance is already inadequate ? with a huge gap between what is needed and what is being offered. A new source of finance from a levy on Big Oil, Coal and Gas could unlock some of the objections by rich countries to including loss and damage in a new Paris agreement?, said Lili Fuhr from the Heinrich Boell Foundation.</p>
<p>The Climate Justice Programme is convinced that existing international law, in particular the polluter pays principle, the no harm rule and the right to compensation support such a system.</p>
<p>?Our proposal draws from precedents such as the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds, the oil spill compensation regime which collects levies from companies that ship oil internationally which are used as compensation after oil spills?, said Julie-Anne Richards.</p>
<p>The fossil fuel industry has so far given no reaction to the levy proposal.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This adorable creature is one of a kind in Spain, where the Fuengirola Bioparc is welcoming the new addition.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Not only is this the first Golden Cheeked Gibbon to be born in Spain, and it's an exciting time for primate lovers across the region.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>At only a month old, the tiny primate will fit into the palm of your hands, and it's mother Ares is very protective of her newest family member.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Scientists say the species in itself was near extinction before habitats were artificially created in order to secure the existence of the primate and a future for Gibbon children.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The rare primate sports a distinctive and glorious blonde coat which is intended to confuse and distract any potential predators or threats to the species during the first three years of their lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the primate reaches maturity however, males turn black and lose their golden locks. Females retain the golden tint in order to attract potential mates.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As a native species to Southeastern Asia, the Gibbon only has seventeen species which were all threatened with extinction up until recent efforts to preserve them occurred.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Being the only zoo in Spain with such a conservation program in place to save the Gibbon, visitors travel across the continent to view the amazing species at the Bioparc Fuengirola.</p>

<article id="0000168" published-at="2010-08-03" title="Gulf Oil Spill Affecting Pets"><p></p>
<p>ATLANTA?People who have lost income because of the Gulf Oi spill have not been able to afford food and veterinary care for their pets, according to a charitable group. The American Veterinary Medical Foundation (AVMF) said in a statement the number of pets entering animal shelters around the Gulf coast has quadrupled since the April 20 oil spill.</p>
<p>Michael Cathey, executive director of AVMF, stated ?Pet-related issues in the Gulf continue to escalate, which is why we called upon our partners to come together to provide relief. Our hope is to ease the pet care challenges families and shelters in the Gulf are facing by providing funding and resources for food and medical care.?</p>
<p>AVMF, Science Diet maker Hills? Pet Nutrition, and Merial, maker of veterinary medicines, are giving money, pet food, and veterinary medical products to clinics in the Gulf area. The purpose is to relieve the hardships of vets who have given free services to their clients during the disaster. The group reimburses vets directly and donates food and supplies for vets to give to their clients.</p>
<p>Mary Bryant, VMD, director, Professional Affairs, Merial, said in a news release, ?We?re pleased that veterinarians can benefit firsthand from this program and help many of their pet patients.?</p>
<p>AVMF is nearly 50 years old, and is the charitable arm of the American Veterinary Medical Association, the national professional organization for veterinarians.</p>

<article id="0000169" published-at="2003-07-08" title="They Tell Lies to Nodders"><p>Last week a newspaper editor expressed surprise about my peacenik views and emailed me accordingly. ?I wonder?, he wrote, ?if you could do a bit of self-psycho-analysis, and examine how a British-Australian former soldier of fairly mainstream views (as I think you were) has evolved into [your present form].? (See <a href="http://www.briancloughley.com/" type="external">www.briancloughley.com</a>.)</p>
<p>I was outraged, and replied that far from having had ?mainstream views?, I possessed in the fairly recent past decidedly right-stream views. Never at a loss for a cliche, I state that not long ago I was several leagues to the right of Genghiz Khan, and replied to Ye Ed that ?I was a thorough-going, kill-a-commie-for-Christ, jackboot-wearing, there?s no-Gook-like-a-dead-Gook, card-carrying, liberal-hating fascist?. I am not and never have been anti-American, but I am decidedly against Bush and his Washington weirdoes, who have steered their country to aggressive and needless confrontation with every country that does not accept servile subordination to the Bush doctrine of imperial supremacy.</p>
<p>There was one main reason for moving from fascist to liberal, and that was the fact that Washington and London tell us lies and that these lies are accepted and resold by people who should know better. My reaction to the announcement that the British Parliament?s report concerning Blair?s exaggerations about Iraq?s weapons of mass destruction was going to be published was that it would be a whitewash, otherwise they wouldn?t publish it. Now that is unhealthy, knee-jerk cynicism, but I didn?t get this way without a lot of help.</p>
<p>When PG Wodehouse wrote humorously about Hollywood he invented a genus called nodders. First there was the film company?s president, then legions of vice-presidents, then there were the nodders whose job it was to attend conferences and agree, by deferential head inclination, with everything that was said. Far too many reporters and legislators are nodders.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the botched attack on some vehicles and the rocketing of a tiny smugglers? hamlet near the Iraq-Syrian border by a deeply secret bunch of US killers supported by aircraft armed with more firepower than a trio of tank squadrons. The affair was a ludicrous, ham-fisted stuff-up. They killed a young woman and her one year-old child, and wounded then took prisoner six Syrian border guards and held them for almost two weeks without explanation. The sheer arrogance of the latter action is staggering. (We won?t even discuss human rights and murdering Iraqi civilians; there?s no point.) The affair was almost as bizarre as the detention of a dozen Turkish soldiers in northern Iraq, about which we were told nothing, either. Nothing, that is, that we can believe.</p>
<p>These operations, I remind you, took place in our name. It was for the safety of the world that Bush and Blair went to war on Iraq, so they say, and that is you and me. And if killings and cock-ups are committed in our name, then we want to know about it. The reason we are told nothing, or lied to with blatant contempt, is that the operations were bungled, therefore they don?t want us to know about them. The Bush cabal and the Blair government-within-a-government told us grotesque lies, before, during and after their war. We all know the device of ?senior government source? and ?senior administration official?, and those of us who have our own sources, here and there, know on many occasions exactly who these people are. It is time ? it is more than time ? that the media refused to publicise ?information? unless the source can be named. (?Cabal? was the name given to a clique of devious ministers appointed by Charles II; their surnames begin with the letters of the word. What about Cheney, Rumsfeld, Ashcroft and Powell?)</p>
<p>If the Bush and Blair ju-ju men want to give the world some facts, they should go on the record. Here is one example of needlessly unattributable nonsense, from the New York Times on July 7 : ?Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a senior Defense Department official said the soldiers who stormed the Turkish compound in Sulaimaniya on Friday were ?acting on intelligence about possible illicit activities that were being planned against municipal officials in the region.? A senior American military official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed this account, saying the plot appeared to be aimed at the governor of Kirkuk, a nearby city.?</p>
<p>I don?t believe a word of it. Associated Press recorded that ?Emel Begler, a Turkish cook who was among the detained together with her 15-year-old son, told reporters the US troops broke down the doors, placed sacks over their heads and handcuffed their hands behind their backs.? So she was plotting to kill the governor of Kirkuk, was she? Ratbane in his Freedom Fries, perhaps. But if the Turkish soldiers she cooked for were indeed plotting assassination, why were they then set free? What?s the real story?</p>
<p>Why the anonymity in this and so many other cases? It appears to be a reflex action, like manacling and blindfolding male Iraqi civilians in order to humiliate them in front of their families. This sort of cave-man thug-stuff never used to happen. What is the point of it? All it does is feed the fires of fury against the US in Iraq, just as anonymous ? cowardly, gutless, amoral ? briefers exasperate and deceive us to the point that we don?t believe a damn word they say. Rumsfeld often insists he be described as a ?senior defense official?, which is cowardice. If he?s got anything to say, let him be named as saying it. Creeping behind the shield of bureaucratic anonymity is the action of a lily-livered sleazebag. But the sycophantic nodders of the media hang on his every deceitful word.</p>
<p>When you trawl the news sites on the Internet you can obtain a lot of accurate first-hand information from Reuters, AP, AFP and other reputable agencies, but when I see a story is sourced to Fox News or CNN I don?t even bring it up on the screen. After months of slewed and slanted rubbish from these unbelievably piffling, bimbo-ridden, nodder-outlets how could anyone trust them to give the right time of day?</p>
<p>Do you remember the ?defence department official? who told the Washington Post (which had a pretty iffy news source in one particularly well-embedded reporter) that Private Jessica Lynch had fought gamely to the last bullet and all that nonsense? She was injured, certainly ? but in the shambles of a panic-stricken vehicle crash. The story about her ?heroism? was fabrication. It was a downright damned lie. So who was the ?official? who concocted this rubbish? He may have only briefly crawled out from beneath the large flat slimy stone under which he normally resides, but why was he not punished for telling us lies? Of course nothing of the sort will ever happen, and the reason for this is that the information system is rotten to its nodding core.</p>
<p>The BBC, one of the last bastions of objectivity and truth, has been attacked by Blair?s scummy little ratbag mumbo-jumbo-meister, Alastair Campbell (?Calamity Ali?), for helping reveal that the Downing Street campaign to mislead the British public about reasons for the war on Iraq was largely successful. The outcome of the British parliamentary inquiry into this squalid affair was predictable, and not just by cynics like me. How on earth can one credit the results of an inquiry that was not allowed to interview the main liar (the prime minister), or have access to all classified reports? How could you believe a man like Blair, anyway, when he is on record, in a moment of political panic, as demanding his nodders think up some ?eye-catching initiatives with which I personally can be associated?? Nothing that would benefit his country or its unfortunate citizens, you understand. Nothing of principle; just something that would look good. The man is a grubby charlatan.</p>
<p>In any event the inquirers were a majority of nodder Labour MPs, and the committee?s clearing of Campbell for his shoddy behaviour was achieved by the chairman (a Blair man to his bootstraps) using his casting vote. This is nodder democracy. On no account would Blair permit an independent inquiry by a trio of impartial judges, with access to every detail of the affair. Such an inquiry would be, well, impartial, and that can?t be allowed, because we might learn the truth, presented to us by people we trust. And Blair and his people wonder why we don?t trust them. They couldn?t stretch out straight in bed; that?s why we don?t trust them.</p>
<p>The same holds in the US. The Senate committee?s whitewash will be exactly the same as the Blair parliament?s lapdog performance, and there is no possibility that a Republican-dominated Congress could ever be critical of Bush, no matter how many lies he told. (Remember these repulsive lulus? : ?Iraq possesses ballistic missiles with a likely range of hundreds of miles?; Iraq ?has trained Al Qaeda in bomb making and poisons and deadly gases?; ?a report came out of the IAEA that [Iraq was] six months away from developing a [nuclear] weapon?. All lies.)</p>
<p>This is why I changed from Genghiz Khan mode. The people we should be able to trust have been lying outrageously to political and journalistic nodders, who happily passed the lies on to us without question and even with embellishment. If you fed them nails, they?d crap corkscrews. The hell with the lot of them.</p>

"And we try to do all of those things with a sophistication and an intelligence that might make it different from Entertainment Weekly, say. But we don't look down our noses at pop culture." He says the Times is adding about 20 people to culture coverage at a time when newspapers elsewhere are cutting back. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_03/b3916001_mz001.htm" type="external">PUBLISHER ARTHUR SULZBERGER JR.</a>: "These are tough times, and they've been tough times for a while."</p></article>
<article id="0000174" published-at="2017-08-16" title="CNN Balks at Trump Campaign Ad Calling Media ?Enemies? [Video]"><p>CNN, which has been called fake news by President Trump, balked at airing a new campaign ad by the president?s reelection committee because it labeled the media as his ?enemies.?</p>
<p>The campaign accused CNN of censorship, by the network said that they requested changes to the ad to make it factual.</p>
<p>?CNN would accept the ad if the images of reporters and anchors are removed. Anchors and reporters don?t have ?enemies,? as the ad states, but they do hold those in power accountable across the political spectrum and aggressively challenge false and misleading statements and investigate wrong-doing,? according to a CNN spokesperson.</p>
<p>This decision by CNN isn?t about making the Trump ad factual, but one bent on eliminating any negative imagery of the liberal media as a whole to maintain the pretense that they are actually trying to cover the president in an even-handed manner despite their anti-Trump narrative.</p>

<article id="0000176" published-at="2016-06-14" title="Sweet Irony! Anderson Cooper Destroys Florida AG Pam Bondi"><p>Today was one of those rare but awesome days when CNN holds someone's feet to the fire. Anderson Cooper, a member of the LGBT Community, interviewed Florida AG and vehement opponent of LGBT rights, Pam Bondi. Today, she is promoting her valiant efforts to prevent fraud against the vulnerable victims and their families with illegitimate GoFundMe pages. It didn't take long for Cooper to remind Bondi of her record of opposing Marriage Equality. Let's revisit some of Bondi's anti-LGBT <a href="http://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/davidbadash/attorney_general_pam_bondi_s_battle_against_same_sex_marriage_will_cost_florida_taxpayers_500_000" type="external">history:</a></p>
<p>Florida's Republican Attorney General Pam Bondi was one of the most active and recognizable fighters against same-sex marriage in the run up to the Supreme Court taking up the issue. And now, Florida taxpayers will have to pay almost a half million dollars in legal fees to the winning attorneys, thanks entirely to Bondi's unyielding defense. NBC Miami reports the final figure is $493,000.</p>
<p>Time after time after time Bondi lost in court, and time after time after time Bondi appealed. Bondi became a reviled figure for the anti-gay rhetoric in her court filings, which were deemed not only false but hypocritical, given she was on her third marriage.</p>
<p>Here's some of the heated exchange:</p>
<p>COOPER: I want to ask you - I saw you the other day saying that anyone who attacks the LGBT community, our LGBT community, you said, will be gone after with the full extent of the law.</p>
<p>BONDI: That's exactly right.</p>
<p>COOPER: I talked to a lot of gay and lesbian people here yesterday who are not fans of yours and who said that they thought you were being a hypocrite, that you for years have fought - you basically have gone after gay people, said that in court that gay people simply by fighting for marriage equality were trying to do harm to the people of Florida, to induce public harm I believe was the term you used in court. Do you really think you're a champion of the gay community?</p>
<p>BONDI: I - let me tell you, I - when I was sworn in as attorney general, I put my hand on a Bible and was sworn to uphold the constitution of the state of Florida. That's not a law. That was voted in to our state constitution by the voters of Florida. That's what I was defending. Had nothing to do - I've never said I don't like gay people. That's ridiculous.</p>
<p>COOPER: But you did say - but do you worry about using language accusing gay people of trying to do harm to the people of Florida -</p>
<p>He continued to fluster Bondi, by simply reviewing her words and actions against equal rights for ALL PEOPLE. The final nail in her coffin came close to the end of the interview:</p>
<p>COOPER: The - the hotline that you've been talking about on television, which allows family members and spouses of the dead to get information -</p>
<p>BONDI: Yes</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>COOPER: Which is incredibly important, and I appreciate you talking about on the air, had there been no gay marriage, had there been no same-sex marriage, you do realize that spouses, there would be no spouses, that boyfriends and girlfriends of the dead would not be able to get information and would not be able probably to even visit in the hospital here.</p>
<p>BONDI: Well, that's -</p>
<p>And he goes in for the kill with a quick question.</p>
<p>COOPER: Isn't there a sick irony in that?</p>
<p>She tried to win the argument by saying that she was defending Florida's Constitution, but Cooper shut her down again.</p>
<p>BONDI: I was defending the constitution of what over 69 percent of the voters put in the constitution.</p>
<p>COOPER: Right. But the - you know, the courts, the federal courts said, that's not the constitution -</p>
<p>He reminded her that she kept fighting the ruling and wouldn't stop until she could no longer appeal. She attempted to switch subjects to the human tragedy that brought them all to Orlando, but Anderson destroyed her attempt to cover up the truth about her homophobia, and that's all the viewers will remember. Just awesome!</p>
<p>In case you weren't disgusted by this woman, she is also the very same Republican who just so happened to drop the investigation into Trump University after the Trump Foundation made a <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-u-scandal-gets-worse-floridas-ag" type="external">$25,000</a>contribution towards her re-election efforts. It's not the least surprising that Bondi and Trump are both on their third marriage, both are typical Republicans.</p></article>
<article id="0000178" title="Rewind: Compare and contrast"><p>Today?s story in the Washington Post about <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/01/AR2010040101904.html?hpid=moreheadlines" type="external">a group of gay and trans Iranian refugees</a> reminds me of how far we?ve come in securing our rights.</p>
<p>While we yawn at news of the latest celebrity coming out and are unimpressed by poll results showing that a majority of Americans are <a href="http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/poll-50-percent-of-americans-cool-with-a-gay-president/19419638" type="external">fine with having a gay president</a> or Supreme Court justice, the Iranians savor their new found freedom in a conservative Turkish city.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we still have a long road ahead. Take for example, the unnecessary and messy slog to repeal ?Don?t Ask, Don?t Tell,? which generated some attention this week.</p>
<p>Although Defense Secretary Robert Gates had outlined <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/25/AR2010032500818.html" type="external">new measures</a> that would make it harder to discharge enlisted lesbians and gays, and made it very clear that the discriminatory law will be repealed, a few top generals have been running interference, hoping to stop the inevitable and exposing their desperation for the old order to remain intact.</p>
<p>Retired NATO commander and former senior Marine officer John Sheehan was forced to write <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hZgCeMMIR1zbfbKVH55fd3GVvkRA" type="external">a letter of apology</a> after recklessly and disingenuously using the horrific Srebrenica genocide as an argument for not allowing openly gay, lesbian and bisexual people to serve in the armed forces. He had testified at a Senate hearing last month that Dutch United Nations troops failed to prevent the massacre because they had homosexuals in their ranks.</p>
<p>Lt. Gen. Benjamin Mixon of the U.S. Army was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/31/AR2010033101101.html" type="external">slapped on the wrist</a> for submitting <a href="http://www.stripes.com/article.asp?section=125&amp;amp;article=68534" type="external">an unsolicited letter</a> to Stars and Stripes, a military newspaper. He brazenly advocated for his personal stance, writing, ?It is often stated that most servicemembers are in favor of repealing the policy. I do not believe that is accurate. I suspect many servicemembers, their families, veterans and citizens are wondering what to do to stop this ill-advised repeal of a policy that has achieved a balance between a citizen?s desire to serve and acceptable conduct. Now is the time to write your elected officials and chain of command and express your views. If those of us who are in favor of retaining the current policy do not speak up, there is no chance to retain the current policy.?</p>
<p>And the commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. James Conway, threw a dud by proclaiming that he <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/26/AR2010032604415.html" type="external">would not force straight Marines to share rooms</a> with gay service members when ?Don?t Ask, Don?t Tell? is repealed. If the general paused for a minute to think about it, with about <a href="http://www.sldn.org/pages/about-dadt" type="external">65,000 lesbians, gays and bisexuals serving</a> in our armed forces, it is most likely that straight and gay marines are already sharing quarters with no adverse affect on morale or unit cohesion.</p>
<p>Finally, Army Secretary John McHugh said that he would <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE62U45Y20100331" type="external">not discharge any gay personnel who came out to him</a>, only to backtrack a day later, claiming that he misspoke. He now warns soldiers that they <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_MILITARY_GAYS?SITE=AP&amp;amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;amp;CTIME=2010-04-01-20-00-11" type="external">can still be dismissed</a> if they do tell.</p>
<p>Aside from ?Don?t Ask, Don?t Tell? is the other piece of legislation which has been introduced in every Congress, except the 109th, since 1994: the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would bar workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Although Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) expects the bill to come up for a vote on the House floor <a href="http://www.lgbtpov.com/2010/03/rep-jared-polis-says-enda-will-pass-the-house-in-a-few-weeks/" type="external">sometime soon</a> and is confident that it will pass, the Senate will not act on the measure, effectively punting ENDA to the next Congress. Again.</p>
<p>And not even in serious contention is the Uniting American Families Act, which would permit partners and spouses of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents to obtain green cards much like spouses of straight citizens and legal permanent residents.</p>
<p>Learning about the dire and often deadly straits of LGBT people in other parts of the world puts things in perspective. We do have it better. But we are hardly full citizens in a nation where all are supposed to be equal.</p>

<article id="0000181" published-at="2016-05-30" title="Palo Alto Networks Inc. Earnings: Missed Where It Matters Most"><p></p>
<p>Based on the beating its stock price took out-of-the-gate following fiscal third-quarter earnings results, it's safe to say Palo Alto Networks investors and pundits were not amused. The problems with Palo Alto's recent quarter range from increased spending to poor guidance and slowing revenue growth. And to make matters worse, it's a healthy dose of all three.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>Despite landing on the wrong side of the earnings fence, Palo Alto responded positively in one of its primary initiatives: boosting its source of recurring revenue. However, as noted in a recent <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/05/25/3-things-to-watch-for-during-palo-alto-networks-in.aspx?source=eptfxblnk0000004" type="external">article Opens a New Window.</a> leading up to the May 26 announcement, Palo Alto investors' patience was only going to be tested for so long. At some point the company needs to perform beyond growing its top line, and it's running out of time.</p>
<p>CEO Mark McLaughlin tried to temper expectations after reporting Palo Alto's second-quarter results by forecasting a 43% to 45% revenue improvement in Q3, ending its nearly two-year-long streak of reporting 50% or more quarterly sales growth. Palo Alto didn't quite reach the remarkable 50% revenue jump this past (fiscal third) quarter, but delivered a pleasantly surprising 48% gain, to $345.8 million. Analysts had expected sales of $339.48 million.</p>
<p>On the earnings-per-share front, Palo Alto hit its high-end forecast of $0.42 on a non-GAAP (excluding one-time items) basis, which also matched pundits' expectations. Fiscal Q3 billings rose a whopping 61% last quarter, to $486.2 million, which would seemingly be a positive sign of what is to come in the current fiscal Q4. But it is not to be.</p>
<p>If not reaching 50% revenue growth is partly to blame for Palo Alto's stock price nosedive, its forecast for the current quarter will be downright depressing. On the high end of McLaughlin's forecast, Palo Alto expects 37% revenue growth to end its fiscal year, or $390 million.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>On a more positive note, Palo Alto's services unit grew a whopping 63%, to $183.7 million, in Q3, and now represents 53% of total sales. Service sales, and the recurring revenue they generate, are a critical initiative for Palo Alto, and they took a step in the right direction last quarter.</p>
<p>As noted before, Palo Alto has been on a spending spree for years to drive its stellar 50%-plus revenue jumps. But with growth beginning to slow -- Q3's results and this quarter's guidance are proof of that -- minimizing costs has become a necessity, not a nicety. The problem is, McLaughlin and team can't seem to keep their checkbooks in their pockets.</p>
<p>A comparison with Palo Alto's peer and primary competitor,Check Point Software , demonstrates why the former's stock is down 26% year to date, and the latter's is up 3%. Palo Alto's total operating expenses of $309.5 million equaled 90% of sales. Check Point, on the other hand, spent 50% of last quarter's $404.3 million in revenue on its operating expenses.</p>
<p>As for cost of revenue, Palo Alto spent $94.9 million to drive its product and services sales, more than twice Check Point Software's $45 million last quarter. Is it any wonder Check Point is profitable, on both a GAAP (including one-time items) and non-GAAP basis? And Check Point's profits continue to climb, too, rising 10% last quarter.</p>
<p>Considering Palo Alto's slowing revenue growth and increased spending, it could be years before shareholders are in the black. Unfortunately, it gets worse because of the nature of Palo Alto's skyrocketing expenses. Check Point's sales and marketing costs equaled 23% of revenue in fiscal Q1, whereas Palo Alto's $202 million ate up a head-shaking 58% of its total sales last quarter.</p>
<p>When investors add it all up, the answer is fairly straightforward: Slowing top-line growth was inevitable, but continuing to spend indiscriminately is not. Until McLaughlin reins in overheads, even improvement in services unit sales and the recurring revenue that comes with it won't be enough to placate shareholders. Nor should it be.</p>

<p>The public mention of&amp;#160;Xi's name is unlikely to quell the world's speculation about why this one man, likely to become one of the world's most powerful leaders, suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>And why has the Chinese government not said anything about this bizarre turn of events?</p>
<p>Xi has missed a number of important meetings with international leaders, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was slated to meet the Xi last week.</p>
<p>The current running theory is that an unexpected health problem has put Xi in hiding.</p>
<p>As the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/9540376/Chinas-Xi-Jinping-mentioned-in-report-on-death-of-general.html" type="external">Telegraph points out</a>, "China's top leaders live and work in isolation and only release information about leading personnel that has been carefully moulded for positive effect."</p>
<p>Chinese officials have declined the answer the media's questions on the health and whereabouts of Xi.</p></article>
<article id="0000183" published-at="2017-12-12" title="&amp;apos;We are one&amp;apos;: Palestinian Christians and Muslims unite against Trump&amp;apos;s Jerusalem call"><p>By Maayan Lubell</p>
<p>JERUSALEM (Reuters) ? Less than an hour after U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel?s capital, Palestinians protested by turning off the lights on the Christmas tree outside Bethlehem?s Church of the Nativity, the traditional birthplace of Jesus.</p>
<p>It was a timely reminder that while headlines focused on Islamist calls for uprisings and Trump?s references to Jewish historical ties, the president?s words also stirred deep feelings among the Palestinians? small Christian community.</p>
<p>Coming out of the Sunday service in his Assyrian Catholic church in Jerusalem, Fredrick Hazo accused Trump of ?dragging all the world into trouble?, and called on the U.S. leader to reverse his decision.</p>
<p>?We are united ? Christians, Muslims, we are one,? said the 59-year-old Palestinian musician, standing in an alley in the heart of the Old City, surrounded by shops selling religious trinkets.</p>
<p>He was frustrated by the politics, but confident the delicate balance the three faiths kept in the holy city would prevail. ?In this sacred place, God is protecting us all. We are guarded by his angels in Jerusalem,? Hazo added.</p>
<p>Christians make up around just one percent of the Palestinian population in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem ? though they punch above their weight in local and national politics.</p>
<p>Back in July, Hazo protested alongside Muslims against Israel?s installation of security scanners at the nearby al-Aqsa mosque ? Islam?s third holiest site ? after two Arab-Israeli gunmen shot dead two Israeli police officers at the site.</p>
<p>It removed the metal detectors after days of bloody clashes, scenes that have not been repeated in the city since Trump?s declaration.</p>
<p>UNITED IN PRAYER</p>
<p>The appeals to religious unity inside Jerusalem?s walls stand in contrast to the more divided voices outside.</p>
<p>In the hours running up to Trump?s statement, Pope Francis called for the status quo in the city to be respected. The Episcopal Church of the United States said Trump?s announcement ?could have profound ramifications on the peace process and the future of a two-state solution?.</p>
<p>But Trump?s decision found strong backing from another corner of the Christian community ? many among his own country?s politically powerful evangelicals who see God?s hand in the modern-day return of Jews to a biblical homeland.</p>
<p>Trump convened a circle of evangelical advisers during his presidential bid, and he was the overwhelming favorite of white evangelical voters in last year?s U.S. election.</p>
<p>?We are all bible-believers and we believe that this is the bible-land and that Jerusalem is the ancient capital of Israel back to the days of King David,? said Dallas-based Mike Evans, part of an evangelical group that met Trump on Monday.</p>
<p>?So for our president to stand up and declare it makes us extremely proud and honored.?</p>
<p>For Palestinian supermarket cashier Mohammed al-Hawa, however, Trump?s words and the logic behind them ignored the more complex reality on the ground.</p>
<p>People of all faith in Jerusalem were united in prayer, the 33-year-old said, even if they were divided over politics.</p>
<p>?Christians, Jews and Muslims live in this city together. There is no problem between them. Only the politics. The governments want to make wars,? he said.</p>
<p>?This is my city ? my blood, my life,? added a 70-year-old Palestinian, walking through the pilgrim-packed courtyard of Jerusalem?s Church of the Holy Sepulchre, revered by Christians as the site of Jesus?s tomb.</p>
<p>The church is packed into a small parcel of land that also holds the al-Aqsa compound and Judaism?s Western Wall</p>
<p>?I can go to the church, to anywhere in Jerusalem, not Trump nor Netanyahu can stop me,? added the man who identified himself only as a ?Jerusalemite?.</p></article>

<article id="0000185" published-at="2017-11-07" title="German Industrial Output Drop in September Seen Short-Lived -- Update"><p>Industrial output in Germany declined more than expected in September but analysts said it was likely a short-term breather as surveys point to acceleration in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Industrial output decreased by 1.6% in September from August, adjusted to seasonal swings and calendar effects, the economic ministry said. Economists in a survey by The Wall Street Journal forecast a month-on-month fall of 0.8%. This decline shaved off some of the 2.6% gain posted in August.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>The underlying trend "still points clearly up," said Ralph Solveen, economist at Commerzbank. He said the September drop must be considered against the backdrop of the strong gain of August, which benefited from a special effect in the auto sector, namely that plant holidays this year fell in July rather than in August.</p>
<p>The bigger-than-expected drop in September together with weak retail sales data for the third quarter point to a possible slowdown in GDP in the third quarter, said Jennifer McKeown, chief European economist at Capital Economics.</p>
<p>But given the fact that "monthly data are not a fully reliable guide," she still expects a 0.6% GDP expansion in the third quarter, the same pace as in the second quarter. She added that the manufacturing index of the Ifo survey points to renewed acceleration in output growth.</p>
<p>Michal Dybula, economist at BNP Paribas, however, said that softer German industrial output "might persist for a couple of months," reflecting a correction to summer volatility and some weakness in Central European leading indicators, which he said have been a good proxy to German industrial data for years.</p>
<p>That said, the European Central Bank's ongoing loose monetary policy and a robust global economic outlook "are consistent with renewed German industrial strength heading into 2018," he added.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Tuesday's weaker-than-expected figures came a day after manufacturing orders data for the same reporting month showed a surprising rise, pointing to resilient growth pace in Europe's largest economy.</p>
<p>Despite the decline in September, industrial output remains lively, the ministry said, expecting production to continue to expand in the coming months.</p>

<p>Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners announced that the 1,200-mile line carrying North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to a distribution point in Illinois had begun commercial service. The Dakota Access pipeline and the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline from Illinois to the Gulf Coast together make up the $4.8 billion Bakken Pipeline system, which ETP said has commitments for about 520,000 barrels of oil daily.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>"The pipeline will transport light, sweet crude oil from North Dakota to major refining markets in a more direct, cost-effective, safer and more environmentally responsible manner than other modes of transportation, including rail or truck," the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Grow America's Infrastructure Now, a coalition of businesses, trade associations, and labor groups that benefit from infrastructure development, issued a statement saying projects such as Dakota Access "are key components to unlocking our nation's economic potential and creating jobs."</p>
<p>Four Sioux tribes in the Dakotas are still fighting in federal court in Washington, D.C., hoping to persuade a judge to shut down the line. Tribes and environmental groups fear it might pollute water sources. More than half a year of protests in North Dakota resulted in 761 arrests before President Donald Trump's administration and the courts allowed the pipeline to be completed earlier this year.</p>
<p>"Now that the Dakota Access pipeline is fully operational, we find it more urgent than ever that the courts and administration address the risks posed to the drinking water of millions of American citizens," Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault said in a statement. "This pipeline became operational today, yet it has already leaked at least three times."</p>
<p>The leaks came as the line was being prepared for service. The Dakota Access pipeline and a feeder line leaked more than 100 gallons of oil in western North Dakota in separate incidents in March, and the Dakota Access line leaked 84 gallons of oil in northern South Dakota in April. No waterways were affected.</p>

<article id="0000196" published-at="2018-07-14" title="The Strange Way We Eat: Bee Wilson?s ?Consider the Fork?"><p>The politest way to eat was with a fork.</p>
<p>Among the English upper classes of the mid-20th century, the ?fork luncheon? and the ?fork dinner? were buffet meals at which the knife was dispensed with altogether. The fork was polite because it was less overtly violent than a knife, less babyish and messy than a spoon. Forks were advised for everything from fish to mashed potatoes, from green beans to cream cake. Special forks were devised for ice cream and salads, for sardines and terrapins. The basic rule of Western table manners in the 19th and 20th centuries was: if in doubt, use a fork. ?Spoons are sometimes used with firm puddings,? noted a cookbook of 1887, ?but forks are the better style.?</p>
<p>Yet we have short memories when it comes to manners. It was not so long ago that eating anything from a fork had seemed absurd. As a kitchen tool, the fork is ancient. Roasting forks?long spikes for prodding and lifting meat as it cooks?have been around since Homeric times. Carving forks, to hold meat down as it is cut, are medieval. Yet forks for eating as opposed to forks for food preparation only started to seem a good idea in the modern era. The table fork is far less time-honored than such objects as the colander, the waffle iron, the bain-marie. In the great scheme of things, eating with prongs is a novelty.</p>
<p>In the parts of the world where forks are not used, they seem profoundly alien instruments?little metal spears that, unlike chopsticks or fingers, clash with food as it enters the mouth. Yet in the West, we use them so universally, we think nothing of them.</p>
<p>In the contemporary Western world, unless we are eating sandwiches or soup, almost every meal we eat now entails a fork. We use the fork to spear vegetables and to steady meat as we cut it; to pick food up or to chase it around the plate; to twirl spaghetti; to flake fish; to build up fragments of different foods into a single choice mouthful; or to hide pieces of unwanted cabbage from our parents? beady eyes. Children play with forks, using the sharp tines to reduce green beans to a mush, or to turn potatoes pink with ketchup. In a formal mood, we may even use a fork to eat a slice of cake, crumb by crumb. At fancy dinners or weddings, we still worry about which ornate fork to use for which course, but forks are also found at the most casual of meals, for the kind of basic snacks for which knives would be out of place. Office workers sit in the park eating pasta salad with a disposable fork, with half an eye on the crossword. Even kebab-eaters, reeling from the pub, will grasp a plastic fork to spare their fingers from the grease.</p>
<p>We take forks for granted. But the table fork is a relatively recent invention, and it attracted scorn and laughter when it first appeared. Its image was not helped by its associations with the Devil and his pitchfork. The first true fork on the historical record was a two- pronged gold one used by a Byzantine princess who married the doge of Venice in the 11th century. St. Peter Damian damned her for ?excessive delicacy? in preferring such a rarefied implement to her God-given hands. The story of this absurd princess and her ridiculous fork was still being told in church circles two hundred years later. Sometimes the tale was embellished. The princess died of plague: a punishment, it was said, for eating with a fork.</p>
<p>Six centuries later, forks were still a joke. In 1605, the French satirist Thomas Artus published a strange book called The Island of Hermaphrodites. Written during the reign of Henri IV, it made fun of the effeminate ways of the previous monarch, Henri III, and his court of mollycoddled hangers-on. In the 16th century, ?hermaphrodite? was a pejorative term, which might be applied to any- one you didn?t much like. In mocking these courtiers, one of the worst things Artus could think of was that they ?never touch meat with their hands but with forks,? whose prongs were so wide apart that the hermaphrodites spilled more broad beans and peas than they picked up, scattering them everywhere. ?They would rather touch their mouths with their little forked instruments than with their fingers.? The implication is that using forks was?like being a hermaphrodite?a kind of sexual abnormality. To Artus, the fork was not just useless?it was obscene.</p>
<p>It was not that spiky fork-like instruments were unheard of before then, but their use was limited to certain foods. In ancient Rome, there were one-pronged spears and spikes for getting at hard-to-reach shellfish, for lifting food from the fire or impaling it. Medieval and Tudor diners also had tiny ?sucket? forks, double- ended implements with a spoon at one end and a two-pronged fork at the other. As sugary sweetmeats or ?suckets? became more common among the rich, so the need for these forks increased. In 1463, a gentleman of Bury St. Edmunds bequeathed to a friend ?my silvir forke for grene gyngour? (candied ginger). The fork end was used to lift sticky sweetmeats out of pottery jars; the spoon end was used to scoop up the luscious syrup. When bits of sweetmeat lodged in the teeth, the sucket fork doubled as a nifty toothpick. But this was not at all the same as a fork in the modern sense?an individual instrument to enable people to eat an entire meal with- out handling the food.</p>
<p>Forks in our sense were considered odd until the 17th century, except among Italians. Why did Italy adopt the fork before any other country in Europe? One word: pasta. By the Middle Ages, the trade in macaroni and vermicelli was already well established. Initially, the longer noodle-type pastas were eaten with a long wooden spike called a punteruolo. But if one spike was good for twirling slippery threads of pasta, two were better, and three ideal. Pasta and the fork seem made for one another. It is a joy to watch a table of Italians eating long ribbons of tagliatelle or fettuccine, expertly winding up forkfuls of pasta, like slippery balls of yarn. Having discovered how useful forks were for eating noodles, Italians started to use them for the rest of the meal, too.</p>
<p>When Thomas Coryate, an Elizabethan traveler, journeyed around Italy sometime before 1608, he noticed a custom ?that is not used in any other country,? namely, a ?little fork? for holding meat as it was cut. The typical Italian, noted Coryate, ?cannot endure to have his dish touched with the fingers, seeing all men?s fingers are not clean alike.? Although it seemed strange to him at first, Coryate acquired the habit himself and continued to use a fork for meat on his return to England. His friends?who included the playwright Ben Jonson and the poet John Donne?in their ?merry humour? teased him for this curious Italian habit, calling him ?furcifer? (which meant ?fork-holder,? but also ?rascal?). Queen Elizabeth I owned forks for sweetmeats but chose to use her fingers instead, finding the spearing motion to be crude.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, real men were said not to eat quiche. In the 1610s, they didn?t use forks. ?We need no forks to make hay with our mouths, to throw our meat into them,? noted the poet Nicholas Breton in 1618. On the cusp of the 20th century, as late as 1897, British sailors were still demonstrating their manliness by eating without forks. This was a throwback, for by then forks were nearly universal.</p>
<p>By 1700, a hundred years after Coryate?s trip to Italy, forks were accepted throughout Europe. Even Puritans used them. In 1659, Richard Cromwell, the lord protector, paid 2 pounds and 8 shillings for six meat forks. With the Restoration, forks were firmly established on the table, alongside the new trifid spoons. Not wanting to dirty your fingers with food, or to dirty food with your fingers, had become the polite thing to do. The fork had triumphed, though knives and spoons continued to outsell forks until the early 19th century.</p>
<p>Start and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.</p>
<p>A speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).</p>
<p>The triumph of the knife and fork went along with the gradual transition to using china dinner plates, which were generally flatter and shallower than older dishes and trenchers. When bowls were used for all meals, the ideal implement was a spoon with an angled handle for digging deep, like a ladle (the fig-shaped spoons of the Middle Ages usually had stems pointing upward). A knife or fork with horizontal handles does not sit naturally in the curved structure of a trencher or a pottage bowl. They need a flat surface. Try to eat something in a deep cereal bowl using a knife and fork, and you will see what I mean; your elbows hunch up and your ability to use the cutlery is severely restricted. Flatness is also necessary for the elaborate semaphore of knife-and-fork table manners that reached their apogee in Victorian times. The plate becomes like a dial, on which you communicate your intentions.</p>
<p>It is sometimes said that the earliest forks were all two-pronged. This is not so. Some very early forks have survived with four prongs (or ?tines?), others with three, and a greater number with two. The number of prongs was an indication not of date but of function. Two prongs were best suited to impaling and stabilizing food?mostly meat?while it was cut (like the carving forks still sold as a set with carving knives). Three prongs or more were better if the fork was to be used as a quasi-spoon, for conveying food from plate to mouth. There were even experiments to push it to the limit with five- pronged forks (like the five-bladed razors that took over from the old two-bladed and three-bladed ones, claiming hyperbolically to be the most ?technologically advanced? way for men to shave), but this was found to be too much metal for the human mouth to hold.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, two distinct methods emerged for handling a knife and fork. The first was christened by the great etiquette guru Emily Post as ?zigzag? eating. The idea was to hold your knife in the right hand and fork in the left as you cut up everything on the plate into tiny morsels. You then put the knife down, seized the fork in the right hand, and used it to ?zigzag? around the plate, scooping up all the morsels. At first, this method was common throughout Europe, but it later came to be seen as an Americanism, because the English devised a still more refined approach. In English table manners, the knife is never laid down until the course is finished. Knife and fork push against one another rhythmically on the plate, like oars on a boat. The fork impales; the knife cuts. The knife pushes; the fork carries. It is a stately dance, whose aim is to slow down the unseemly business of mastication. Both the Americans and the British secretly find each other?s way of using a fork to be very vulgar: the British think they are polite because they never put down their knives; Americans think they are polite because they do. We are two nations separated by common tableware, as well as by a common language.</p>
<p>In the four hundred years since Thomas Coryate marveled at Italian meat-forks, our food has changed immeasurably, yet our dependence on the fork largely has not; we use them more now than ever. Like the colander, in use since ancient times, it is an example of a kitchen technology that has stuck. Although we may abandon it to munch a hamburger or to attempt to use chopsticks in a Chinese restaurant, the fork is entirely bound up with our experience of eating. We are so used to the sensation of metal (or plastic) tines entering our mouths along with food, we no longer think anything of it. But our use of forks is not inconsequential?it affects our entire culinary universe. As Karl Marx observed in the Grundrisse, ?The hunger gratified by cooked meat eaten with a knife and fork is a different hunger from that which bolts down raw meat with the aid of hand, nail and tooth.? Forks change not just the how of eating but the what.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that forks are always superior to other methods of eating. As with every new kitchen technology from fire to refrigeration, from eggbeaters to microwaves, forks have drawbacks as well as benefits. The Renaissance opponents of the fork were right, in many ways. Knives and forks are handy enough for cutting a slice of roast beef, but are more hindrance than help for eating peas or rice, which are better served by the humble spoon. Eating with a knife and fork carries with it a complacency that is not always justified. It is a very fussy way of eating food. We often over-attribute efficiency to the technologies we are accustomed to. Because we use knives and forks every day, we do not notice how they hamper us.

<article id="0000197" published-at="2012-09-07" title="How Mitt Dodged the Draft"><p>May 1966. &amp;#160;Mitt Romney is just finishing his first?and only?year at Stanford.&amp;#160; I?m a 32-year-old ex-Strategic Air Command navigator and intelligence officer, now an associate professor in Stanford?s English Department and something of an anti-Vietnam War activist.</p>
<p>About a quarter of a million young American men are already being abducted each year to fight the rapidly-escalating Vietnam War. &amp;#160;Many college students, however, are protected by their 2S student deferments, which blatantly discriminate against all those millions of other young men unable to afford college.&amp;#160; As if this privileging of the relatively privileged were not sufficient, an outcry about ?inequity? arises from administrations of some elite universities.&amp;#160; Since the 2S deferment is contingent on relatively high class rank (meaning, of course, academic class rank), they argue that this unfairly discriminates against some of the ?best? students, i. e., all those attending schools like Stanford.&amp;#160; A man in the bottom quarter at an elite university might end up being drafted, even though he might be more ?intelligent? than a man in the top quarter of some state college.</p>
<p>To address such claims of injustice, the Selective Service was rolling out that month the College Qualification Test, a.k.a. the Selective Service Examination, an ?objective? assessment of each test taker?s verbal and mathematical skills, to be used by local draft boards, together with college grades and class rank, to determine who was entitled to that precious 2S deferment and who should be shipped off to Vietnam.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; But this deferment test actually spotlighted the true inequities of the draft.&amp;#160; It also offered an opportunity for direct action against the war itself, right on the college campus.</p>
<p>One of the many myths that have buried the true history of the Vietnam War is that the anti-war movement was motivated by selfish desire, especially among college students, to avoid the draft (a view that conveniently ignores the movement?s throngs of female participants, whose gender automatically exempted them from the draft).&amp;#160; Quite to the contrary, students demonstrating against the draft deferment tests were specifically undermining and targeting their own privileges and exemptions, which, as they passionately argued, came at the expense of poor and working class people.&amp;#160; At Stanford, a number of people actually <a href="" type="internal"></a>disrupted the test.&amp;#160; The young men involved thus proved that their goal was not to avoid the draft but to end it, since they had been explicitly warned that their actions would jeopardize their&amp;#160;own deferments.&amp;#160; When students filed in to take the Selective Service test, other demonstrators handed them the SDS ?alternative test? on the history of U.S.-Vietnam relations.&amp;#160; About ninety students organized a sit-in in the President?s office.&amp;#160; In a manifesto issued from the sit-in they denounced their own privileged status: ?We oppose the administration of the Selective Service Examination . . . because it discriminates against those who by virtue of economic deprivation are at a severe disadvantage in taking such a test. . . . [The] less privileged, Negroes, Spanish-Americans, and poor whites, must fight a war in the name of principles such as freedom and equality of opportunity which their own nation has denied them.?&amp;#160; ?Conscription,? they declared, has throughout American history ?invariably been biased in favor of the wealthy and privileged.?</p>
<p>Enter young Mitt Romney, right on cue, waving a sign denouncing the anti-war students.&amp;#160; &amp;#160;He, like his fellow almost all-male participants in this pro-war demonstration, fervently argued in support of the war and the draft.&amp;#160; But not, of course, for himself.</p>
<p>When Mitt enrolled at Stanford back in the spring of 1965, the official and overt U.S. war (as distinct from the previous forms of proxy, clandestine, and ?adviser? warfare waged in Vietnam for more than a decade) had just begun.&amp;#160; Operation Rolling Thunder, the sustained U.S. bombing of the north, had started on March 2.&amp;#160; The first officially acknowledged U.S. combat units were the Marines who went ashore at Da Nang on March 8 (joining the 24,000 U.S. military personnel already fighting in Vietnam).&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Draftees were not yet being used in combat.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; So Mitt and his dad clearly intended the fall of 1965 to be the beginning of a fine four-year career at Stanford for the young man.&amp;#160; But Mitt?s last month as a Stanford student was May 1966.&amp;#160; Why?</p>
<p>Although the Selective Service Exam radically reduced the chances of college men, especially those with the test-taking skills of most Stanford students, to be conscripted into the Vietnam War, it was no guarantee of long-lasting deferment.&amp;#160; There were other, surer, escapes from the Vietnam nightmare.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; One of the very best was the ministry.&amp;#160; In 1966, young men flooded into divinity schools, embarking on careers to be ministers, priests, and rabbis.&amp;#160; The Mormons had an even better deal than most religions, because The Church of Latter-Day Saints required each and every one of its young men to become, for at least two years, a ?minister of religion.?&amp;#160; &amp;#160;Thus all Mormon young men could claim deferments as ministers.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; When the inequity of this arrangement became too blatant, the Selective Service entered into an agreement with the LDS that required the church to specify just one ?minister? for each geographical district.&amp;#160; Since there were relatively few Mormons in Michigan, and Governor George Romney had considerable influence in the church, Mitt quickly received an official appointment as a Mormon ?minister of religion,? consecrated by a draft deferment from the Selective Service. &amp;#160;So instead of returning to Stanford, Mitt went off to become a Mormon missionary in France, where he would spend the next two and a half years?while Vietnam became a slaughterhouse for the Vietnamese and many Americans drafted to slaughter them.</p>
<p>So who says that Mitt Romney is inconsistent?&amp;#160; After all, what may have been his first recorded public political act was supporting the draft for ordinary Americans, forcing them to participate in a war waged in the interest of his own class.</p>

<p>Contrary to the professions of the Left, diversity is not America?s strength. Diversity is a weakness. For America as a nation, unity is our strength and we have lost it.

<p>It?s worth considering that homosexuals, lesbians, bisexuals and transsexuals might be safer returning to the closet. Flaunting gross immorality and defiant wickedness that is hideous, odious and wretched to an overwhelming majority of people is a foolish and dangerous course of action.</p>
<p>Those who come to the United States from other cultures?some of which are infinitely more moral than our own?are going to be offended and repulsed by the rampant depravity that has become a defining characteristic of our culture.

<article id="0000201" published-at="2016-10-19" title="Here's Why Intel Corporation Shares Plunged After Earnings"><p></p>
<p>Image source: Intel.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>After microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) reported its financial results for the third quarter of 2016 and offered a forecast for the fourth quarter, the company's shares dropped more than 5% in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>Although Intel reported strong financial results (revenue for the quarter was better than guided, for example), the drop -- at least in the near term -- appears to be justified. Here's why.</p>
<p>Intel's revised financial guidance for the quarter called for $15.6 billion in revenue -- representing the midpoint of the range that Intel provided -- thanks to an uptick in sales of chips that go into personal computers. Intel actually delivered $15.8 billion in revenue, handily beating the midpoint of its revised guidance and analyst consensus of $15.58 billion.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>So why is the stock taking a drubbing if it actually beat analyst estimates?</p>
<p>Analysts were expecting Intel to guide to revenue of around $15.86 billion for the fourth quarter of the year; Intel guided to $15.7 billion -- missing expectations, albeit slightly. Investors often place greater value on future performance and less on past performance, which is probably a large reason the stock is selling off.</p>
<p>However, the problems run a little bit deeper than a headline guidance miss; there was a pretty significant red flag in the company's earnings report -- particularly in its results for its highly important data center group business. (If you're unfamiliar with why this segment is so important to Intel and its investors, read <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/10/13/intel-corporations-data-center-business-3-things-i.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness" type="external">this Opens a New Window.</a>.)</p>
<p>During the first half of the year, Intel's data center business delivered disappointing revenue growth relative to its long-term 15% compounded annual growth rate guidance and even its full-year guidance of low-double-digit percentage growth -- 9% in the first quarter and just 5% in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Despite those lackluster results in the first half of 2016, Intel management insisted that it could still hit its double-digit growth target for the year as a result of a significant reacceleration during the second half of the year. Intel's data center group achieved just 10% year-over-year growth in the third quarter and, unsurprisingly, guided down full-year expectations to just "high-single-digit growth."</p>
<p>Although the better-than-expected results in the company's personal computer chip business helped to bolster the quarterly results -- even the "worse than expected" fourth-quarter guidance still represents a healthy number -- investors are very sensitive to the performance of the company's data center group.</p>
<p>Remember, Intel and many investors have basically written off hopes of ever seeing its PC business as a "growth" business again -- it's a large cash cow that's going to milked for every last dollar of operating profit that it can reasonably produce.</p>
<p>The data center group, on the other hand, represents the company's best hope over the long term at sustainable growth, since the markets it serves are generally growing. If this shows signs of faltering, then Intel's growth prospects may appear dimmer -- leading to a lower share price.</p>
<p>Although the headline results might seem bad, things look better when one takes a look under the covers. The bulk of Intel's data center group revenue comes from the sale of processors, and according to the company's 2015 investor meeting, those processor sales can be broken down into three major categories:</p>
<p>Intel's prior forecast called for each of these segments to represent roughly a third of the processor revenue that its data center group generates in 2016.</p>
<p>Image source: Intel.</p>
<p>According to Intel, although the second two categories performed well -- and they're generally viewed as the healthy and growing sub-segments of Intel's data center business -- the enterprise server portion of its business came in worse than expected. Intel says it was looking for enterprise-related revenue to be roughly flat, but it wound up declining about 3% in the quarter.</p>
<p>The good news here is that the sub-segments that have historically been growing are still growing, so it's not as though these results cast doubt over the long-term trends that this business is expected to benefit from. It just so happens that one generally problematic and disappointing sub-segment was a little more problematic and disappointing than is usually the case.</p>
<p>So although the data center results were disappointing, they're hardly cause to freak out over. If you liked Intel's long-term prospects before the earnings report, then this one "miss" really shouldn't change that fundamental view.</p>

<article id="0000204" title="George Weigel Interviewed on the Second Anniversary of Pope Francis?s Election"><p>Two years ago today, Pope Francis was introduced to the world in a rainy St. Peter?s Square, asking for prayers. George Weigel, who was there that night with NBC News, is the author of more than 20&amp;#160;books, including the two-volume biography of John Paul II,&amp;#160;Witness to Hope&amp;#160;and&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/247596/popes-legacy-george-weigel" type="external">The End and the Beginning</a>,&amp;#160;and, most recently,&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/339783/setting-world-ablaze-interview" type="external">Evangelical Catholicism</a>&amp;#160;and&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/374507/path-rome-kathryn-jean-lopez" type="external">Roman Pilgrimage</a>.&amp;#160;?He is Distinguished Senior Fellow at the <a href="" type="internal">Ethics and Public Policy Center</a> where he holds the William E. Simon Chair in Catholic Studies. He talks here with NRO about Pope Francis and the Church. ? KJL</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Kathryn Jean Lopez: Why is Pope Francis in an evangelical hurry, as you?ve put it?</p>
<p>George Weigel: Because he has felt the mercy of God in his own life and wants to share that experience with others. Because he sees a world in need of the Gospel, and of friendship with Jesus Christ, as an antidote to the self-absorption and loneliness that are eating away at the solidarity of the human community. Because, in the Vatican, &amp;#160;if you don?t get something new done quickly you may not get it done at all. Because he?s 78 years old and knows that his will be a short pontificate.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>KJL: You?ve written that he has ?reanimated the papacy.? What does that mean for Church teaching?</p>
<p>GW: I hope it means that the new interest in the pope evokes a new interest in the Church?s teaching, of which the pope is the custodian. Francis ought to be taken at his word when he says, as he has often done, that he is a son of the Church who believes and teaches what the Catholic Church believes and teaches. If his media-generated popularity, fragile as that may turn out to be when the world discovers that the pope is really a Catholic, opens windows of possibility for explaining that divine mercy leads us to the truths God revealed to us (and inscribed into the world and into us), then his reanimation of the papacy will advance the ?Church in permanent mission? for which he called in&amp;#160;Evangelii Gaudium, which is the grand strategy document of his pontificate.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>KJL: In that same article for the Tablet, a British magazine, you said, ?All over the world, Francis is news, and when the Pope is news, so is the Church and the Gospel.? Is that still good news when the pope seems to be interpreted in different ways by different people? When the Gospel seems to be interpreted in different ways by different people?</p>
<p>GW: That?s the obvious challenge, perhaps even danger, here. By its very nature as a custodial office, the papacy can?t be a Rorschach test, into which people read whatever they like ? whatever they fear or hope for. So when media ?narratives? about Francis get set in concrete, and act as filters bending or distorting (or ignoring) aspects of his vision and his teaching that don?t fit the established story line, the Church has a problem. There?s an obvious investment in some media circles in the ?narrative? of ?the pope who?s finally going to get with it.? And as a friend at a major American newspaper said to me when I complained about this tendency in his own paper, ?You know how these media narratives are. They?re like bamboo.? Meaning, once they start growing, you can?t kill them.</p>
<p>Perhaps the dumbest of these story lines is that Francis has re-opened conversation and debate in a Church that had been closed and claustrophobic for 35 years under John Paul II and Benedict XVI. I defy anyone who, over the last 35 years, has spent time on the campuses of Notre Dame or Georgetown, or who has read the National Catholic Reporter, or who has gone to a meeting of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, to make that claim without experiencing a twinge of conscience that says, ?I should wash my mouth out with soap.?</p>
<p>The most enduring of the false narratives is that the signature phrase of the early pontificate ? ?Who am I to judge?? ? was a matter of the pope jettisoning millennia of Catholic moral teaching. It was not. It was a specific response to the circumstances of a man who had repented and was trying to live an upright life; it was, in a word, what any sensible pastor, facing that specific set of circumstances, would say. But ripped out of context, it has become an all-purpose filter through which everything else ? including the pope?s multiple reaffirmations of Humanae Vitae, Paul VI?s encyclical on the morally appropriate means of family planning ? gets airbrushed out of the picture.</p>
<p>And then there?s the trope about an impending ?global-warming encyclical.? The pope is preparing an encyclical on nature and the environment, including the human environment (which includes the moral imperative of a culturally affirmed and legally recognized right to life from conception until natural death). So what happens? A low-ranking Vatican official with gauchiste tendencies and a marked talent for self-promotion gives an interview to the Guardian, one of the most consistently anti-Catholic newspapers in the world, in which he claims that this is a global-warming encyclical ? which he couldn?t possibly have known, as the document wasn?t drafted yet. The Guardian loves it, because it fits the story line of the long-awaited Great Catholic Cave-In. So the story wafts across the Atlantic, where it?s picked up with glee by Catholic progressives and horror by some Catholic conservatives ? and the battle of the blogs is on, full blast. No one bothers to ask whether there?s any basis in fact for the assertion that this is going to be a ?global-warming encyclical.? So when climate change gets some attention in a 100-page document, the most important parts of which will have to do with the theology of stewardship and the theology of ?human ecology,? it?s almost certainly going to be rapturously embraced, or bitterly opposed, as a ?global-warming encyclical,? despite the evidence that it?s much more broadly gauged than that.</p>
<p>More pro-active Vatican communications might be able to do something about all this, but when the Holy See is constantly in the mode of, ?No, what the pope really meant was . . . ,? the game has already been largely forfeited.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>KJL: What is it that is so powerful about Pope Francis?s example? His gestures?</p>
<p>GW: The world needs a pastor, whether it knows it or not. And Francis communicates the pastoral embrace of the Church, the breadth and inclusiveness of Catholicism symbolized by the Bernini colonnade around St. Peter?s Square, in a powerful way. What is amazing here is that he started doing this at age 76; there was none of it in Buenos Aires, as least on a vast scale. So here?s a contrast to John Paul II, who was an immensely attractive public figure in Cracow and then brought that capacity to inspire-by-example to Rome ? although some of the narrative-merchants seem to have forgotten that.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>KJL: What is it about the missionary mandate of the Church that modern-day Catholics miss in the West?</p>
<p>GW: We?re used to institutional-maintenance Catholicism, in which the institution ticks along by its own inertia and people are ?born? into the Church. Francis knows that is over and done with: ?Kept? Catholicism, whether ?kept? by legal establishment or by cultural habit, has no future. The only future is intentional Catholicism, evangelical Catholicism. That?s what he and the other bishops of Latin America proclaimed at their Aparecida meeting in Brazil in 2007.&amp;#160; And that?s what the liveliest parts of the world Church today ? ranging from the booming Church in Africa to FOCUS missionaries on American campuses ? are living: a Catholicism that has discovered that it doesn?t have a mission, it is a mission. The people who are behind the curve of the Catholic future are the institutional-maintenance types. The Germans now seem the primary example of this ? which is another reason to scratch the head at their seeming determination to force the whole Church to adopt the Catholic Lite approach that has, in a bizarre inversion, emptied German churches of congregants while vastly expanding the German Church?s bureaucracies.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>KJL: All this focus Francis has put on family, and all the debates he has seemed to encourage, what is that about? Where do we wind up? Is there a danger in the risks he seems to have taken?</p>
<p>GW: The pope knows that the marriage culture is in crisis throughout the world, and so is the family. He comes to that conviction as a pastor, not as Brad Wilcox or Charles Murray. So he wants to challenge the Church to find pastoral responses to that crisis that meet real human needs. The turmoil of the Synod last October was in large part the result of the Synod?s being hijacked by a small cabal of northern-European bishops, determined to make the entire exercise a referendum on some things the rest of the Church already considers settled: the permanence of marriage and the conditions for receiving Holy Communion worthily. I think the Synod of October 2015 is going to get back to that broader agenda ? at least I hope it does, and I?ve reason to believe that there are many bishops determined that that will be the case.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>KJL: What do you say to conservative friends who are nervous ? or disappointed, or dismissive, or livid, or heartbroken ? about the pope?</p>
<p>GW: ?You don?t believe what you read in the papers about anything else; why do you believe it about the pope?? That?s where I?d start.</p>
<p>I?d then suggest that these people, if they?re Americans, look back on the last 35 years of our ecclesial experience and take heart from that. The dramatic reform of seminaries continues. The priests and bishops who take their pastoral model from John Paul II will continue to do so, perhaps learning a lesson or two from Francis along the way ? and they?ll be the overwhelming majority of the Church?s ordained ministers ten, twenty, thirty years from now. The dynamically orthodox orders of religious women will continue to grow, and the dying orders, which long ago opted for the lightest of Catholic Lite, will continue to die. Younger theologians will continue to pursue and understand truth rather than deconstructing it, as a lot of their elders seemed to want to do. Vital parishes built on the Bible and the sacraments, committed to evangelizing their neighborhoods, will continue to flourish. The poor will be served, the sick healed, and the dying comforted. None of that is going to change, and I?d wager that it?s going to get better. The Church in the United States turned a corner about three decades ago, and the idea that we?re going back to the incoherence of the late Sixties and Seventies is, frankly, silly. Let?s have a little faith in what the Holy Spirit has done among us these past 35 years.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>KJL: What do you say to liberals who warn Francis (like that Rolling Stone cover a year or so ago) that he?d better not be like Benedict, that he?d better be the pope of their ideological hopes and dreams?</p>
<p>GW: That anyone would imagine finding insight in a Rolling Stone article on a pope, be he Francis, Benedict XVI, Agapitus I, or Leo the Great, is beyond my comprehension; it would be like seeking the inside scoop on the rock scene inForeign Affairs. What I hope my liberal friends (and I have more than a few) take from this pontificate is that mercy and truth are never separable in Catholic pastoral life. The Church offers the medicine of the divine mercy so that healed souls can grasp the truth that will liberate them in the fullest meaning of human freedom. I?d also hope that my liberal friends, who find in this pope a critic of what they?re pleased to call ?culture-warrior? Catholics, will read carefully, and ponder even more carefully, what Pope Francis had to say about the ?ideological colonization? implicit in Western decadence when he was giving robust pro-life, pro-family talks in the Philippines earlier this year. (In fact, the nervous conservatives should read those texts, too.)</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>KJL: Is there any shot at cleansing some of the ideology that?s crept into Church circles and getting back to something more sacramental?</p>
<p>GW: That?s happening all the time in the best parishes in the Church, where the transformative power of the Eucharist is experienced through the dignified celebration of Holy Mass, and people are empowered for mission because of that.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>KJL: Why are people responding to him so favorably? He blows Pew polls off the charts. Is there a real impact he?s making?</p>
<p>GW: The impact remains to be seen; I don?t think we can measure the enduring impact of John Paul II, for example, for another hundred, perhaps two hundred, years. The short-term impact is that people are encouraged to give the Church another look. It?s up to the liveliest parts of the Church ? the dynamically orthodox parts of the Church ? to seize that opportunity.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>KJL: What is the ?encounter? he talks about? What are the ?peripheries??</p>
<p>GW: Again, the pope takes his vocabulary from his pastoral experience, not from the rhetorical tool kit of liberation theology, with its Marxist yammering about ?center? and ?periphery.? The ?peripheries,? for Francis, are all those who have fallen through the cracks of late-modernity and post-modernity ? in his native Argentina, because of colossal corruption, political and financial. The pope speaks with great passion about the shame we should all feel when, as he puts it, ?a man does not have the dignity of earning bread for his family,? but is turned into a peripheral person, a welfare client, a dependent. The ?encounter? with the people on the peripheries is intended to draw them into the circle of common care and concern ? that call to encounter is, to use a favorite world of John Paul II?s, a call to solidarity. And that means, it seems to me, aggressive Catholic efforts to empower the poor ? and a profound Catholic challenge to all those cultural forces that are eroding stable families, which are the elementary schools where we learn to take responsibility for our lives, which is the highest exercise of freedom.</p>
<p>The emphasis on the ?peripheries? is also a distinctively ?Franciscan? way of expressing the pope?s respect for untutored popular piety ? a respect, I might add, that was shared by St. John Paul II. No one who reads and reveres the New Testament should doubt for a second that the pious poor and marginalized have something to teach all of us ? including German theologian-bishops ? about the truth of the Gospel and the mysteries of the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>KJL: What have your conversations with him been like?</p>
<p>GW: Robust, quite candid, occasionally whimsical, very friendly; everything?s on the table.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>KJL: Has the Vatican changed on account of him? What does the future hold?</p>
<p>GW: The most important appointment Pope Francis has made is the appointment of the Australian cardinal, George Pell, as the Vatican?s financial overseer. The colossal mess in Vatican finances that Francis inherited two years ago has been cleaned up, and cleaned out. Real budgeting and accounting procedures are in place; so are real professionals, not somebody?s nephew. The job now is to institutionalize all of that, and I wouldn?t bet against Cardinal Pell, who hasn?t shied away from contact sports since his days as an Australian-rules football star.</p>
<p>It would seem that the rest of the re-design of the Roman Curia is not going nearly as well. And the contrast between these two realities, two years on, underscores a point I learned long ago about the papacy: One of the most important qualities in a pope is his judgment of people ? can he get around him the people who can put into practice his vision of what the Church must be doing now to fulfill its mandate from the Lord?</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>KJL: Who is Jesus Christ to Pope Francis?</p>
<p>GW: The Lord with whom he speaks for hours every day in prayer. The Risen One who reached out, touched his life, and called him into mission.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>KJL: What?s the most constructive Catholic response to him?</p>
<p>GW: The papacy is an impossible job. So the best thing Catholics can do for the pope is to pray for him.</p>
<p>Then they owe him the loyalty that is expressed in speaking the truth to him ? and that puts a premium on knowing whether what you?re happy about, on unhappy about, has a basis in fact, or is merely a reflection of the ?narrative.? By the same token, the new and stringent Ultramontanism on the Catholic Left ? in which even the mildest questions about how things are working in this pontificate are denounced as treasonous disloyalty ? is an affront to the open conversation for which the pope has called.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>KJL: What is his visit to the United States going to mean for the Church here?</p>
<p>GW: For us, it?s going to be a great gathering of the vast and multifaceted Catholic family. For him, it?s an opportunity to experience the vitality of Catholicism in America, which, despite all its problems, is the best embodiment of his ?Church in permanent mission? in the developed world.</p>

<p>The deaths last week come after a warning in October from the International Committee of the Red Cross that the country was at risk of an epidemic of the disease.</p>

<p>An attempt by the Christian Brothers to restrict the Laffoy Commission in its investigation into child abuse was rejected by Justice Henry Abbott in the High Court on Friday. The Brothers had argued that it was unfair and possibly unconstitutional that findings of fact relating to the alleged abuse of children could be made by the Commission, against Brothers who were dead or who were too old and infirm to defend themselves. The Christian Brothers have already said that they accept that abuse took place in their institutions but have also noted the majority of those accused before the Commission vehemently protested their innocence.</p></article>

<article id="0000208" published-at="2016-11-04" title="The Curse is Finally Broken, But Not For Goats"><p>In the lead-up to the Cubs historic title run, fans embraced a tongue-in-cheek culture of superstition and consumption in hopes of reversing the 108-year-old title drought attributed to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_the_Billy_Goat" type="external">Curse of the Billy Goat</a>. &amp;#160;Chicago?s Halsted Packing House reported a <a href="" type="internal">25% increase</a> in demand for goat as grocery stores and restaurants eagerly cash in on ?eat away the curse?-style promotions. &amp;#160;Last year, a team of competitive eaters went so far as to <a href="" type="internal">consume an entire 40-pound goat</a> in a bid to alter history. The opposite end of the supply chain, however, is far less jovial. &amp;#160;Alongside fellow animal rights activists, I have visited Halsted Packing House to bear witness to animals delivered for slaughter. &amp;#160;The truck shows up around 4:30 Monday mornings ? a reflection of the prevailing out-of-sight, out-of-mind societal attitude toward animal slaughter. &amp;#160;Slaughterhouses ? once the pride of the city ? have almost all closed or moved to rural areas, for much the same reason. The experience is nothing short of heartbreaking. &amp;#160;We?ve witnessed <a href="" type="internal">baby animals cower at the edge of the trailer, terrified of what?s next</a>. &amp;#160;We?ve witnessed <a href="" type="internal">a baby goat ? immobilized by fear, injury or both ? physically carried to slaughter</a>. &amp;#160;And we?ve witnessed one animal after the next look to us with pleading eyes, desperate for any kind of comfort. When Michael Vick was brought up on dogfighting charges in 2007, his cries of cultural relativism fell on deaf ears. &amp;#160;He served 18 months in federal prison and topped a <a href="" type="internal">Forbes poll</a> as America?s most hated athlete two years running ? certainly no favorite amongst the goat-consuming Cubs? base.</p>
<p>But is his brand of needless violence toward animals objectively worse than that which we thoughtlessly inflict upon billions of other animals? &amp;#160;We?ve seen countless investigations exposing the inevitable brutality of industrialized animal agriculture; it can hardly be argued that these animals have it any better than Vick?s dogs. Activists know the world won?t fundamentally shift overnight, but we do think we can shift it bit by bit. &amp;#160;So last Monday, I joined activists in delivering a <a href="" type="internal">letter to the office of Mayor Rahm Emanuel</a> demanding the immediate closure of all slaughter facilities in Chicago. This would be a small step to say the sort of pain that baby goat went through is unacceptable in the City of Chicago. Too often, discussions of what happens to animals raised for food center around whether people are vegan, vegetarian, or omnivorous. Regardless what we do, we can support political moves to protect animals from violence. With a recent <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/183275/say-animals-rights-people.aspx" type="external">Gallup poll</a> showing 32% of Americans believe ?animals should be given the same rights as people? and millennials? diets increasingly reflecting this shift, it?s time for our governments to start responding. Increment by increment, we can get our culture and habits to where we aspire.</p>
<p>Goats and other animals have been cursed for far too long. Maybe in the wake of the Cubs? curse?s demise, we can end the pox over animals too.</p>

<article id="0000210" published-at="2018-01-03" title="8 GOP lawmakers ask for Kentucky House speaker's removal"><p>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) ? Eight Republican lawmakers have asked for Kentucky's GOP House speaker to be removed from office after he secretly settled a sexual harassment complaint with a female legislative aide.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10CjvIEfeChQ3b4wev5vvbd-sDm4ZxKkD/view?usp=sharing" type="external">formal disciplinary charges</a> filed Wednesday against Jeff Hoover include sexual harassment, creating a hostile work environment and using taxpayer resources to hide the allegations from the public.</p>
<p>Hoover's actions, the lawmakers allege, "violated statute, brought great harm to the body's ability to conduct the people's business, and irreparably damaged the reputation of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Kentucky."</p>
<p>"Upon finding these charges to be true, we respectfully ask the committee to recommend the expulsion of (Hoover) from the House of Representatives," the lawmakers wrote in the complaint.</p>
<p>Hoover has denied sexual harassment, but said he sent inappropriate yet consensual text messages to a woman who once worked for the House Republican Caucus.</p>
<p>Hoover told The Associated Press he believes the complaint is motivated by politics. It was signed by Republican Rep. Phil Moffett, who Hoover said has "wanted to be speaker since he got here."</p>
<p>"He has been working with this small group of legislators and the executive branch for weeks in their collective effort to harm me," Hoover said. "So, I'm not surprised. They can't touch my faith, and my family and lots of friends still support me, and they will not take away my joy."</p>
<p>Moffett declined to respond to Hoover's comments, but said "we have a duty and a responsibility to discipline our members."</p>
<p>"We can't allow cover-ups and sexual harassment and hostile work environments and things like that to happen. It's absolutely unacceptable," he said.</p>
<p>In November, Hoover appeared to be one of dozens of powerful men across the country toppled by allegations of sexual harassment or abuse. He announced he would resign as speaker but keep his seat in the legislature. But Tuesday, Hoover said he was only temporarily stepping aside as speaker "until further notice," leaving open the possibility he could return to power.</p>
<p>The settlement signed by Hoover and three other Republican lawmakers was handled outside of court and paid for with private money to avoid publicity. But the Courier Journal exposed the settlement, creating an uproar in a state that was transitioning to Republican rule after decades of dominance by Democrats.</p>
<p>The complaint was signed by Moffett and fellow Republican state Reps. Addia Wuchner, Kim King, Russell Webber, Stan Lee, Robert Benvenuti, Tim Moore and Joe Fischer. It says Hoover sent text messages to the woman requesting photos of her in a "black lace g string," saying they were "for my eyes only" and promising to delete them.</p>
<p>It also says Hoover created a hostile work environment by using his office to "conduct interviews and intimidate witnesses (who) had knowledge of his illicit relationship."</p>
<p>The complaint was filed under new House rules adopted Tuesday, which require a special committee of three Republicans and three Democrats to investigate. Republican Rep. Jerry Miller, as chairman of the State Government Committee, will chair the special committee and will only vote to break a tie.</p>
<p>"It's not my intention to drag it on a day longer than it has to," Miller said.</p>
<p>House Republican Caucus spokeswoman Daisy Olivo has filed a lawsuit claiming Hoover and the woman involved in the settlement had "physical, sexual encounters" and that he used money from prominent political donors to pay for the settlement. But the woman, through her attorney, said none of that was true. Hoover has also denied having a sexual relationship with the woman.</p>
<p>Hoover and the other Republican lawmakers who signed the settlement say a confidentiality clause prevents them from discussing it publicly. House GOP leaders have asked the Legislative Ethics Commission to use its subpoena power to determine if lawmakers used money from political donors or registered lobbyists to pay the settlement, which could violate state law.</p>
<p>Republican Gov. Matt Bevin has publicly urged Hoover to give up his position as speaker and his seat in the legislature. Bevin told a WKYX radio on Tuesday he still expects Hoover to resign this week.</p>
<p>"Well he's very misinformed, but beyond that I'm not going to say anything," Hoover said.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Bevin did not respond to an email seeking comment.</p>

<article id="0000214" title="The man from Mount Vernon"><p>William James Cumbie was a mover and shaker on the Virginia Baptist scene for nearly 60 years. He first appeared on the Virginia scene in 1948 when, at age 25, he was the energetic new pastor of the First Baptist Church of Annandale. It was the beginning of a love affair with that wild, reckless and growing child known as Northern Virginia.</p>
<p>It also was the beginning of a more important love life. Just two weeks before beginning his Annandale pastorate, Cumbie married Catherine ?Kay? Inscoe and the couple honeymooned in Colonial Williamsburg, declaring that they loved each other and Virginia.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Bill Cumbie</p>
<p>The '50s and '60s were exciting years of church growth, denominational development and, for the Cumbies, family building. In fairly close succession, the couple had four children: Elizabeth, James, Rebecca and Judith. The Annandale church occupied the young man's energy and he helped it grow from a core group of about 75 to a membership of over 700. He led the church in building programs. He developed a quick step and learned every back road from Alexandria to Vienna, visiting his far-flung congregation and developing long-lasting relationships among those in other churches.</p>
<p>In 1952 Bill Cumbie was present at Columbia Baptist Church for the organizational meeting of the new Mount Vernon Baptist Association, which included 25 churches out of the old Potomac Association. In 1956-57 Cumbie served so effectively as moderator of the Mount Vernon that one pastor remarked that he had never seen a better, more efficient district association moderator. The same man predicted that ?this young pastor will be heard from in the future in larger Baptist councils in Virginia and our Southland.? It was a prophetic statement.</p>
<p>In 1957, the association was ready to appoint a full-time superintendent of missions, a title which changed over the years to executive director. At age 34, Cumbie was elected as the association's first executive and he steamed ahead with all the gusto of youth. For the next 30 years, until his retirement in 1988, he led the day-to-day work of the Mount Vernon, rallying leaders in the member churches, building staff and programs and planting the Baptist banner all across the burgeoning metro Washington area. He was not satisfied even when the Mount Vernon became one of the undisputed models for associationalism in the nation. He always pushed for something more, something better.</p>
<p>Cumbie became active in every phase of Baptist life. He was involved in the professional organization for SBC ?DOMs? (directors of missions, as they were known). He served on the board of trustees of his alma mater, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. He was an unpaid assistant to the chief leader of the Baptist World Alliance and never missed a BWA Congress. And he embraced the Baptist General Association of Virginia as if he were one of Virginia's native sons.</p>
<p>He studied Virginia Baptist history. When someone mentioned Editor R.H. Pitt's classic address, ?The Virginia Baptist Temper and Tradition,? Cumbie laughed that he had read the address in its full original text, noting the omissions in later printed copies. He chaired the General Association's 150th anniversary committee. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Richmond and claimed it as proudly as he did his earned degree from Baylor University. He learned the politics of the General Association. He understood the intricacies of its framework and organization. In 1975-76 he achieved ?the highlight? of his life with election to the office of president. He was the first director of missions to serve as president of a state convention.</p>
<p>Bill Cumbie early discovered that to master public meetings it was necessary to master parliamentary law. He served as parliamentarian of SBC meetings and frequently for the BGAV. In 1985 he openly criticized Charles Stanley's ?flagrant misuse? of parliamentary procedure at the pivotal SBC meeting in Dallas.</p>
<p>Whenever as a messenger to a BGAV meeting, Cumbie rose to a microphone during a business session, a hush fell over the room and all ears listened. Seasoned messengers would punch newcomers and whisper for them to listen up. And Cumbie was always right on target with his objections and observations. Wags wondered if the man from Mount Vernon slept with the BGAV constitution and bylaws as well as with Robert's Rules!</p>
<p>Bill Cumbie was feisty, determined and hopeful. His personality was shaped by nine years in an orphanage in Macon, Ga., and by gentle folks at the First Baptist Church of Macon.</p>
<p>At 10, he accepted Christ and was baptized. Two years later, the orphanage's superintendent expressed the hope that one day Billie might become its first preacher. The boy was only 12 but he already knew that the pulpit was his destination. As ?DOM? for Mount Vernon, over a 30-year period, he averaged preaching somewhere every other day (not every other Sunday but every other day). And he possessed a power and skill in the pulpit which enabled him to reach any type of congregation.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish so much, he had to be master of himself and slave to a clock. He once admonished this columnist that every person has equality in one thing: everyone has the same 24 hours within a single day. It mattered how you organized and prioritized and ?I haven't got time? was not a valid excuse.</p>
<p>Bill Cumbie suffered no fools. He was never bashful about buttonholing someone, jabbing his pointed finger into the air or into someone's chest, and holding forth when truth as he perceived it was misrepresented. People?friends, colleagues and even opponents?listened because ultimately they respected him. They understood that the man from Mount Vernon knew whatever he was talking about and that he cared passionately about the subject and, even more, about them.</p>
<p>He died on Feb. 19 at age 83; and when Virginia Baptists gather again, the man from Mount Vernon will be missed.</p></article>

The Republican Party?s Senate campaign fundraising group dropped its support for congressional hopeful Roy Moore Friday, amid sex assault allegations against the Alabama candidate.</p>
<p>The National Republican Senatorial Committee, the fundraising arm for Senate Republicans, signaled its disassociation with Moore <a href="http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/532/201711109086621532/201711109086621532.pdf" type="external">in a filing</a> with the U.S. Federal Election Committee.</p>

<article id="0000220" published-at="2016-03-02" title="President Obama Speaks About ACA 'Glitches'"><p></p>
<p>President Barack Obama spoke to the nation Monday from the White House, addressing glitches with the Affordable Care Act's registration process since its rollout more than two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>Obama acknowledged concerns from many Americans about the issues involved in registering for health insurance via the Affordable Care Act's website, healthcare.gov. The president said his team is doing "everything we can possibly do to get the websites functioning faster," and said there's no excuse for the problems users have experienced.</p>
<p>"Everybody who wants insurance through the marketplace will get insurance. Period," the president said.</p>
<p>From the beginning, those wanting to sign-up for insurance via the Affordable Care Act?s marketplace experienced a host of problems including even just accessing the site&amp;#160; and even fewer people were actually able to register for a policy they wanted on the first few days the site was live.</p>
<p>In addition, some of those who were able to successfully logon, create an account, and select a policy also ran into glitches that caused them to sign up for more than one insurance plan, or send incomplete data to insurance companies from the new enrollees, according to several reports.</p>
<p>Because of the unsuccessful rollout of the ACA?s registration site, the Obama administration has been heavily criticized for not testing the operation more adequately before it was made available to the American public. The ACA was also under the intense spotlight of the recent government shutdown and debt ceiling debate in Washington following the site?s launch. Republicans attempted, unsuccessfully, to include various forms of repeal or alteration into legislation aimed at re-opening the government from its 16-day shutdown, and raise the nation?s debt limit.</p>
<p>Despite repeated attempts by the GOP, the president?s signature health-care law remains in-tact, and the president set out Monday to defend it.</p>
<p>Though an ardent defender of the law, President Obama expressed frustration with the enrollment process, empathizing with Americans attempting to enroll, saying "no one is madder than me" that the site isn't functioning as it should, "which means it's going to get fixed."</p>
<p>Glitches aside, the president said the law exceeded expectations thanks to lower prices than expected and more choices for those enrolling ? and contended even those who have already enrolled are ?thrilled,? and that the essence of the law is working just fine, it?s the technical details that just need work.</p>
<p>?We did not wage long, contentious battle just around website. Waged battle to make sure millions of Americans have same chance to get same security as everybody else. That is what this is about. ACA has done that,? the president said.</p>
<p>Still, even supporters of the president's signature health-care law are pointing out that the president is not answering basic questions, such as: What is actually wrong with the website, what is being done to fix it, and when will it be fixed?</p>

<article id="0000223" published-at="2016-03-28" title="Good News in Facebook's Drive to Win Over Publishers"><p></p>
<p>Image source: Facebookbrand.com.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>It looks like Facebook is about to become a much bigger player in the news arena. After one not-so-successful attempt at cajoling publishers to post their news stories directly to the social network, the company hasreportedly tweaked its offering enough to appease bigger publishers testing out the updated Instant Articles platform. And now it has plans to extend its reach into news much further, bringing aboard other online news publishers and bloggers starting this spring, when it will open Instant Articles to all publishers.</p>
<p>The latest move has the chance to help Facebook in two ways:</p>
<p>Facebook has been trying to get its Instant Articles platform off the ground since last May. Its initial rollout with some publishers last year, however, didn't go over very well. Those who tested out the platform found that it wasn't delivering the kind of ad revenue that would make it advantageous for them to publish articles directly to the social network rather than publish to their own sites and use social to guide readers to the content.</p>
<p>Round 2 has gone better Facebook took a step back later last year and made changes in hopes of easing some of the news publishers' concerns. It now offers the publishers 70% of the revenue generated on the Facebook-procured ads on their Instant Articles and 100% of the revenue of any ads they procure themselves.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Image source: instantarticles.fb.com.</p>
<p>It also loosened up restrictions on how many ads the publishers could place on each article page. Facebook, understandably worried about diminishing its users' experience, had initially set ad limits that publishers testing the pages found too restrictive to make the type of money necessary to consider staying on board.</p>
<p>Those changes were apparently enough to satisfy some very popular publishers. Several <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-instant-articles-advertising-fixes-win-over-publishers-1455218551" type="external">spoke recently to The Wall Street Journal Opens a New Window.</a>, including Business Insider, Vox, and Mic, all major players in online news with varied audiences. Each had good things to say about their ability to generate revenue through the platform, and through the use of the ads procured through the Facebook Audience Network.</p>
<p>Bringing Instant Articles to smaller publishersSoon after that WSJ report, Facebook announced plans to extend Instant Articles to all Web publishers. The company is no doubt comfortable with what it heard back after the tweaks and is ready for a major expansion to the platform, which is expected to come sometime after the F8 Facebook Developer Conference in April.</p>
<p>The move to post content through Instant Articles will not be not an easy one for many news publishers. It has the potential to offer a healthy source of digital ad revenue, which can be frustratingly elusive for companies that don't deal in the type of big data that Facebook and Alphabet do. It also offers the potential of a much greater reach, with the ability to share content with friends an important component in delivery.</p>
<p>But publishers have to reckon with a downside, too. Publishing directly to Facebook's platform has the potential to further commoditize the news content they deal in, siphoning off even more of their brands' strength over time.</p>
<p>On top of that, it creates the potential for the publications to become increasingly more reliant on Facebook for their digital traffic -- and digital ad revenue. That's not a problem as long as the rules are working in their favor, but if Facebook were to change these rules, the publishers could be in a much weaker bargaining position than they were when they demanded better terms from Facebook last year.</p>
<p>Maybe not a "win-win," but it could be mutually beneficialBut it's not as if they were in a strong position to start with, either. Generating digital ad revenue has been difficult for many publishers. If Facebook's platform offers them the ability to generate as much or more revenue than they can from the same story on their own site, we should expect them to continue publishing directly to Facebook.</p>
<p>For that reason, it made good sense for Facebook to have sweetened the pot enough to get them to stick around. While it's sharing a bigger portion of its ad revenue now, the long-term gains would seem to go to the social network.</p>

<article id="0000224" published-at="2017-11-28" title="WATCH: Roy Moore Staffer 'Physically Attacks' Cameraman"><p>In video captured outside a rally in Henagar, Alabama on Monday night, a campaign staffer for embattled Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore appears to lose his cool on a cameraman, grabbing has camera and creating a brief scuffle before the two men are separated.</p>
<p>Alabama-based reporter Connor Sheets posted the raw footage of the incident on Twitter. "Man wearing Roy Moore sticker physically attacked a cameraman attempting to film Moore's arrival outside campaign rally a few minutes ago here in Henagar, Alabama," Sheets <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/935303103175450625" type="external">explained</a> in the caption. "Another man w/ Moore sticker verbally assaulted a second cameraman."</p>
<p>Connor later <a href="https://twitter.com/ConnorASheets/status/935308755956363264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fcampaign%2F362061-moore-supporter-physically-confronts-cameraman-outside-campaign-rally" type="external">confirmed</a> that the staffer who physically confronted the cameraman was Tony Goolsby, the coordinator for Moore's DeKalb County team, who had organized the event Monday. Below is the footage (h/t <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/362061-moore-supporter-physically-confronts-cameraman-outside-campaign-rally" type="external">The Hill</a>):</p>
<p>Moore's campaign has been in a state of crisis since The Washington Post published a bombshell report containing allegations from four women who claim that Moore pursued them sexually or romantically when they were teenagers and he was in his early 30s.</p>
<p>One of the accusers says she was only 14-years-old when he pursued her and initiated sexual contact ( <a href="" type="internal">watch her first interview after the story broke here</a>). Another woman has since come forward alleging that Moore forced himself on her <a href="" type="internal">when she was 16</a>.</p>
<p>Moore has consistently denied all of the allegations.</p>
<p>Many Republicans have called for Moore to step aside while President Trump has sent mixed signals, most recently making clear that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-moore/alabama-senate-candidate-moore-calls-allegations-dirty-politics-idUSKBN1DR22P" type="external">he will not campaign for Moore</a> but saying the people of Alabama should be allowed to decide whom they elect.</p></article>
<article id="0000225" published-at="2016-01-13" title="What Would Hillary Do If She Won Powerball? Here?s Her Stupid Answer."><p>On Wednesday morning, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told Clinton-enthusiast and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108515/" type="external">The War Room</a> star George Stephanopoulos of ABC News that if she won the <a href="http://www.powerball.com/" type="external">Powerball</a> jackpot?currently up to $1.5 billion?she would use the money to ?fund her campaign.?</p>
<p>?Before we go, did you buy a Powerball ticket?? asked Stephanopoulos.</p>
<p>?I did, I did!? she responded to the ?hardhitting? question.</p>
<p>Stephanopoulos followed up: ?And if you win??</p>
<p>?Well, fund my campaign!? she answered like a true power-hungry, entrenched politician followed by one of her most evil Hillary-styled cackles to date.</p>

<p>Hillary, as usual, didn?t exactly come off as the most ?likeable? person with this answer, although she actually did seem sincere.</p>
<p>Here are some of the top reactions via Twitter:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ABC" type="external">@ABC</a> Didn't she already win the jackpot? <a href="https://t.co/rZZWNjeQzX" type="external">pic.twitter.com/rZZWNjeQzX</a></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ABC" type="external">@ABC</a> What a disgusting answer from a multi millionaire who wants to lead our country. "I would buy more power!"</p>

<article id="0000227" published-at="2017-12-30" title="US rallies to 4-3 shootout win over Canada in outdoor game"><p>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) ? Out of the way, Canada. Brady Tkachuk and the Americans are just fine when it comes to handling snow and ice.</p>
<p>Tkachuk and Kieffer Bellows found plenty enough traction on a snow-covered rink to score shootout goals and cap the United States' 4-3 victory over Canada on Friday in international hockey's first outdoor game at a junior world championships.</p>
<p>Much like they did the similar two times against Canada at the world junior hockey championship, the defending gold-medal-winning Americans overcame a two-goal deficit by scoring twice in a span of 34 seconds in the third period.</p>
<p>"It just made it better with the snow coming down and the fans' excitement. You could definitely feel it," Tkachuk said of a game played with snow persistently falling from the opening faceoff. "We knew we were taking it to them in the second and third period and Coach was saying, if one goes in, two go in."</p>
<p>A snowball effect, perhaps. And it happened in front of a world junior tournament record crowd of 44,592 ? some going shirtless in celebrating the bitter elements ? at the NFL Buffalo Bills' home, New Era Field.</p>
<p>The Americans (1-1-1) showed resolve in not only beating their cross-border rivals, but overcoming the disappointment of a 3-2 loss to Slovakia on Thursday.</p>
<p>"That talks a lot about our group and the locker room and how close we are as a family," Bellows said. "There was never a doubt in the whole entire locker room or on the bench at any point."</p>
<p>Tkachuk and Ron Perunovich scored in the third period, while Casey Mittlestadt had three assists to take over the tournament lead with six points (two goals, four assists). Bellows scored his tournament leading fourth goal, and goalie Jake Oettinger stopped 19 shots through overtime and all four he faced in the shootout.</p>
<p>Boris Katchouk, Cale Makar and Dillon Dube scored for Canada (2-0-1), which has lost four straight meeting to the Americans. It was a familiar and disappointing result for goalie Carter Hart, who was also lost the championship game to the U.S. in January.</p>
<p>"Last year doesn't matter at all," said Hart, who stopped 32 shots through overtime Friday. "Tomorrow, we get the chance to finish in first place, so that's what on our mind's now."</p>
<p>By earning a point for the shootout loss, Canada still has the edge in the Group A standings in being two points ahead of the Americans. The Canadians can clinch top spot with a win in their preliminary round finale against Denmark (0-3) on Saturday.</p>
<p>In the only other tournament game, St. Louis Blues draft pick Klim Kostin scored twice in leading Russia (2-1) to a 5-2 win over Belarus (0-3). Russia clinched a Group B berth in the quarterfinal round Tuesday. Belarus closes the preliminary round against the Czech Republic on Saturday and is in jeopardy of finishing last in five-team Group B standings.</p>
<p>Bellows scored on the Americans' first shootout chance by snapping a shot through Hart's legs. Then Tkachuk scored by firing a shot in the top right corner.</p>
<p>Down 3-1, Perunovich cut the lead to 3-2 from the slot by capping a give-and-go passing play with Mittelstadt with 13:51 left. Mittlestadt, the Buffalo Sabres' first-round pick, then set up Tkachuk in front for the tying goal by gathering a loose puck behind the net after Canadian defenseman Kale Clague lost his stick.</p>
<p>The Americans drew upon last year's win over Canada, in which they trailed 4-2.</p>
<p>"Just believing you're never out of the game. We had a lot of hockey left to be played," U.S. defenseman Adam Fox said. "Last year, it was a very similar thing. Some guys who are returning had that experience to tell guys this year that, 'You know, we're not down and out.'"</p>
<p>It was a familiar feeling of disappointment for Canada.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it's a tough pill to swallow once again losing to the Americans in the shootout," forward Michael McLeod said. "The only good thing is that this is round robin."</p>
<p>The crowd on Friday appeared evenly split with American and Canadian fans, many of whom spent much of the game standing. As night fell, a red glow emanated from the middle section of the stadium, where rows of heaters hang above the seats.</p>
<p>Flurries began falling during the pre-game national anthems, and the snow fell harder as the game progressed. It began falling so heavily that the surface had to be shoveled at each commercial break starting late in the second period. Work crews filled several wheelbarrows full of snow, which were dumped onto a pile that grew to about seven feet behind the east end of the rink.</p>
<p>Oettinger had an opportunity to take time to enjoy the atmosphere.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I did see the shirtless guy on the Jumbotron. Yeah, I took a look a couple of times," Oettinger said with a smile. "A really fun win, but now we've got to put it behind us."</p>

<p>The National Republican Congressional Committee posted the 30-second TV spot on its <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=PJLGqUK4dvM" type="external">YouTube site</a> on April 3. It opens by saying the <a href="http://mcintyre.house.gov/index.php/about-mike/biography" type="external">nine-term Democratic congressman</a> has been in Washington too long. It then says, ?And we?re paying the price. Instead of voting to balance the budget, he voted to spend $1.8 trillion on Obamacare.?</p>
<p>The NRCC is referring to McIntyre?s March 21 vote on a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;ved=0CDMQFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gpo.gov%2Ffdsys%2Fpkg%2FBILLS-113hconres25eh%2Fpdf%2FBILLS-113hconres25eh.pdf&amp;amp;ei=apRcUbmaBubp0gHdo4CYCA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHoT-QXUYLsI1hEr5xRfIPMcdPrCA&amp;amp;sig2=GBilYQjb1wFdbD0ufXx-JA&amp;amp;bvm=bv.44697112,d.dmQ" type="external">non-binding resolution</a> that sets budget levels for fiscal years 2015 through 2023. It passed <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll088.xml" type="external">221-207</a> without a single Democratic vote. The budget resolution, which was drafted by the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, is a statement of the party?s budget principles. It calls for a balanced budget in 10 years and the repeal of the federal health care law. Specifically, the budget blueprint says the budget chairman ?may revise? the spending levels to account for the ?budgetary effects of any bill ? that reforms or replaces the Patient Protection and Affordable Care or the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.?</p>
<p>The fact is nothing in the budget resolution itself would repeal the Affordable Care Act. That would have to happen in a separate repeal bill ? which McIntyre has repeatedly supported.</p>
<p>Here are the major votes taken in the House to approve and later repeal the health care law:</p>
<p>In addition to a full repeal of the law, McIntyre voted with Republicans to defund all or part of the health care law.</p>
<p>For example, he was <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll285.xml" type="external">one of five House Democrats</a> on May 3, 2011 to vote for legislation that would have barred federal funding for the state health insurance exchanges that will be created in 2014 under the Affordable Care Act. He also was <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll097.xml" type="external">one of three House Democrats</a> to vote for an amendment ( <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-02-18/pdf/CREC-2011-02-18-pt1-PgH1202-6.pdf#page=1" type="external">No. 575</a>) to an appropriations bill that would have prohibited the use of federal funds for ?any employee, officer, contractor, or grantee of any department or agency? previously funded by the health care law.</p>
<p>The ad also says ?McIntyre voted to keep Obamacare?s taxes? ? another reference to his vote on the non-binding resolution. That, too, is misleading. McIntyre voted not only to repeal the entire law and to defund it, but he also <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1370:" type="external">cosponsored a bill</a> in 2011 to repeal the annual fees imposed on health care providers by the new law. And he <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2012/roll359.xml" type="external">voted in 2012 to repeal the medical device tax</a> contained in the law.</p>
<p>We should point out, too, that although the ad criticizes the congressman for not ?voting to balance the budget,? McIntyre in 2011 <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.j.res.00002:" type="external">cosponsored</a> and <a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll858.xml" type="external">voted for</a> a balanced budget amendment ? which was a goal of the budget resolution.</p>

<article id="0000230" published-at="2012-05-09" title="Why Washington Needs Dick Lugar"><p>Sen. Dick Lugar (R-Ind.) &amp;lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/talkradionews/2510926965/sizes/l/in/photostream/"&amp;gt;TalkRadioNews&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;/Flickr</p>
<p></p>
<p>Centrism and bipartisan consensus often are unduly worshiped by Washington?s punditeers, who are ever bemoaning the decline of across-the-aisle dialogue and compromise. Frequently, these calls for cooperation are escape routes for those who prefer to transcend real and important political and policy divides and who yearn to position themselves above the critical but down-and-dirty squabbles that shape this country?s future. Yet there are times when the pursuit of a common purpose uniting Democrats and Republicans is necessary to advance important policy aims and to demonstrate to the citizenry that the nation?s capital can function and serve the public interest. And in an era of increasing political rancor, Washington?s ability to rise to this task is now diminished with the primary defeat of Sen. Dick Lugar, an Indiana Republican.</p>
<p>Lugar was beaten on Tuesday by Richard Mourdock, the tea-party-favored state treasurer. This was not unexpected. Lugar, a <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/Senate/Richard_Lugar.htm" type="external">moderate</a> GOPer who had served in the Senate since 1977, was ripe for the defenestration. Tea partiers in recent years had eviscerated other targeted-from-the-right Republican senators, including Bob Bennett of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. (Murkowski was able to retain her seat via an unconventional <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/11/17/murkowski-wins-election-write-candidate-ap-projects/" type="external">write-in campaign</a>.) And Lugar, unlike John McCain (who successfully beat back this sort of challenge in 2010), did little to protect his right flank in the past two years.</p>
<p>Lugar?s defeat will be cited by the hand-wringing DC pooh-bahs as another sign of hopelessness. But the loss of Lugar?as opposed to, say, the loss of Bennett?will have true policy ramifications, for this Hoosier frequently endeavored to forge bipartisan coalitions to advance national security priorities.</p>
<p>Most notably, as I recounted in my new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Showdown-Inside-Fought-Against-Boehner/dp/0062107992" type="external">Showdown: The Inside Story of How Obama Fought Back Against Boehner, Cantor, and the Tea Party</a>, Lugar worked?that is, conspired with?the Obama White House to win ratification of the New START treaty reducing the number of US and Russian nuclear weapons. With leading Senate Republicans opposed to the treaty?mainly, it seemed, because Obama had negotiated it?Lugar, the senior Republican on the Senate foreign relations committee, collaborated with Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), the chair of that committee, and Vice President Joe Biden to devise a strategy to circumvent his party?s opposition. This entailed undercutting McCain, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and the GOP?s chief voice on arms control, Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.).</p>
<p>The yearlong effort to achieve ratification?which was approved on a bipartisan vote as the lame-duck session of 2010 was coming to a close?was a deftly mounted effort. At one point, Kerry, though he controlled the committee, had Lugar introduce the ratification resolution in order to win over a couple of Republican senators so the White House could claim the treaty had bipartisan backing. And Kerry even complained publicly about Lugar?s resolution to make it easier for Lugar to sell it to his GOP comrades. It is hard to envision a Democratic White House cooperating as closely with another Republican senator on such a significant matter.</p>
<p>Lugar?who years earlier had worked in the Senate with Obama to pass <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2008/08/25/28084/rove-obama-lugar/" type="external">legislation</a> to detect and secure loose nukes overseas?was not a pushover for Obama. Prior to Obama?s launching of multilateral strikes on Libya, he told the president he would <a href="http://video.msnbc.msn.com/morning-joe/42207545" type="external">not support this action</a>. He also publicly raised questions about US involvement in Afghanistan, <a href="http://lugar.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=332665" type="external">noting</a> in 2011, ?It is exceedingly difficult to conclude that our vast expenditures in Afghanistan represent a rational allocation of our military and financial assets.? But he was the rare Republican lawmaker who preferred to collaborate than clash with the president.</p>
<p>Lugar was an independent?and often reasonable?GOP voice on foreign policy, surviving for decades within a party that often put a premium on extreme and harsh positions. A decade ago, he joined with Joe Biden, then a senator, and fellow Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) to try to slow President George W. Bush?s rush to war in Iraq. In response to Bush?s request for legislation authorizing him to attack Iraq at a time of his own choosing, Lugar, Biden, and Hagel pushed an <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=iznyGV9qkjoC&amp;amp;pg=PA127&amp;amp;lpg=PA127&amp;amp;dq=Biden-Lugar-Hagel+bush+war&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=zgWHqPMEIS&amp;amp;sig=lHxGDcXhBg6HC563VpNPUz6WOAg&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=4qSpT72BBaaPigLBupHJCw&amp;amp;ved=0CGcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Biden-Lugar-Hagel%20bush%20war&amp;amp;f=false" type="external">alternative</a> that would permit Bush to initiate a war only for the purpose of destroying Iraq?s WMD and only after seeking United Nations approval. Absent a UN green light, Bush would have to come back to Congress and demonstrate that the Iraqi weapons threat was so ?grave? that only military action could eliminate it. (The Biden-Lugar-Hagel effort ended up being derailed by none other than Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, who cut a deal with the Bush White House and essentially accepted the resolution Bush was demanding.)</p>
<p>Lugar was a charisma-challenged Republican. His attempt at <a href="http://www.4president.us/websites/1996/lugar1996website.htm" type="external">a presidential campaign</a> in the 1996 cycle was ludicrous. (During his announcement, he stood alone on a rather big stage and looked quite small.) But he was a policy-minded legislator who did the heavy-lifting on issues far from the spotlight and who was not reluctant to put aside partisanship when policy progress was possible. As Washington?s centrism fanciers predictably grieve the electoral demise of another member of that endangered breed, the Republican moderate, this is indeed a genuine loss for those who care about arms control, nuclear nonproliferation, and foreign-policy discussions that are serious and deep, not silly and opportunistic.</p>
<p>UPDATE: On Tuesday night, Obama released this statement: ?As a friend and former colleague, I want to express my deep appreciation for Dick Lugar?s distinguished service in the United States Senate. While Dick and I didn?t always agree on everything, I found during my time in the Senate that he was often willing to reach across the aisle and get things done. My administration?s efforts to secure the world?s most dangerous weapons has been based on the work that Senator Lugar began, as well as the bipartisan cooperation we forged during my first overseas trip as Senator to Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan.?</p>

<p>One of Hillary Clinton?s major donors is former Goldman Sachs employee Donald Mullen Jr., a man who, when he began to see the market decline that led to the 2008 crash, cheerfully wrote to his colleagues, ?Sounds like we will make some serious money.?</p>
<p>Zaid Jilani writes at The Intercept:</p>
<p>Mullen, while a Goldman Sachs employee, pioneered the trades that allowed the mega-bank to profit from the collapse of the housing market. Mullen?s team utilized financial instruments called collateralized debt obligations to essentially bet against subprime mortgages. [?]</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2012, Mullen left Goldman Sachs to do the opposite of what he did in 2007: He started a hedge fund, the purpose of which was to buy up foreclosed homes and rent them out. New York&amp;#160;magazine?s Kevin Roose described the career change this way: ?A guy whose most famous trade was a successful bet on the full-scale implosion of the housing market is now swooping in to pick up the pieces on the other end.?</p>
<p>Mullen gave $100,000 to Priorities USA Action on June 30. According to Federal Election Commission data, this is the largest single contribution he has made to any soft money organization in his giving history. (In total, he has given $220,000 to soft money groups and $529,621&amp;#160;in individual contributions.) [?]</p>
<p>Back in the last presidential election, Priorities USA used both the foreclosure crisis and Wall Street as campaign issues against the Republicans. In a 90-second ad hitting Mitt Romney, for instance, the Super PAC used a clip of the former Massachusetts governor saying that we shouldn?t ?try and stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom.?</p>
<p>Today, Priorities USA is running ads focusing on a variety of issues, but avoiding direct attacks on&amp;#160;Wall Street. Its primary social media account, on Twitter, has mentioned Wall Street only once, pointing to an article about Clinton?s financial plan that, as it turns out, &amp;#160;leaves big banks intact.</p>

<article id="0000239" published-at="2017-12-04" title="Broadway Box Office: ?Hello, Dolly!? Gets Even Hotter"><p>Will ? <a href="http://variety.com/t/dolly/" type="external">Hello, Dolly!</a>? keep going up, up and up this holiday season? It looks poised to, with the ultra-hot revival moving into the final weeks of Tony-winning star Bette Midler?s run and the holidays bringing tourists to the city. Last week, most individual shows declined at the <a href="http://variety.com/t/broadway-box-office/" type="external">Broadway box office</a> compared to the boffo numbers from <a href="http://variety.com/t/thanksgiving/" type="external">Thanksgiving</a> week, but ?Dolly!,? energized by what is likely the beginning of a frenzy to catch Bette before she goes, managed to uptick.</p>
<p>?Hello, Dolly!? ($2,478,968) once again broke the house record at the Shubert Theater, a feat the show seems likely to repeat more than once as demand heats up prior to Midler?s Jan. 14 exit. The musical was among the small group of shows to rise week-over-week after the Turkey Day boom, including ? <a href="http://variety.com/t/beautiful/" type="external">Beautiful</a>? ($1,006,732), bumping up nicely to rejoin the millionaires? club, as well as ?M. Butterfly? ($409,943), up a bit after star Clive Owen was out for a few performances the prior week.</p>
<p>Other than that, almost every single show on the boards declined. Because <a href="http://variety.com/2017/tv/awards/melina-matsoukas-anthony-hemingway-directors-bring-diverse-tv-projects-to-life-1202463697/" type="external">Thanksgiving</a> sales were so inflated, some of the Street?s hottest tickets ? ?Hamilton? ($2,837,331), ?The Lion King? ($2,087,845), ?Wicked? ($1,825,028) and ?Aladdin? ($1,466,570) ? were down by more than half a million apiece (but still doing just fine, thank you). ?Charlie and the Chocolate Factory? ($846,298) also tumbled, but should continue to attract family audiences over the holiday weeks and then bring in heightened last-minute sales before it closes Jan. 14.</p>
<p>Also contributing to the overall drop at the box office last week was the fact that Bruce Springsteen took a break, so ?Springsteen on Broadway? didn?t add any coin to the pot. The mega-selling production picks up again this week.</p>
<p>Two plays opened ? ?Meteor Shower? ($870,728) starring Amy Schumer and ?The Parisian Woman? ($689,134) with Uma Thurman ? so they probably would have declined anyway, even if it weren?t the week after Thanksgiving. Another play, Manhattan Theater Club?s staging of ?The Children? ($193,707 for seven previews), started up slowly.</p>
<p>Among the fall?s newest offerings, ?The Band?s Visit? ($1,092,929) dipped by $200,000 but still topped $1 million, while ?SpongeBob SquarePants? ($583,037) hosted critics before the show opens tonight. ?Once On This Island? ($395,580) proved modest in its opening week, but can expect to gain steam following the <a href="http://variety.com/2017/legit/reviews/once-on-this-island-review-broadway-1202629232/" type="external">critical raves</a> lavished on the show after its Dec. 4 opening.</p>
<p>Overall Broadway sales slowed by $9.1 million to $30 million ? a 23% drop ? for 30 shows now playing. Attendance fell 22,420 to 242,528.</p></article>

<p>Wal-Mart asserted that it would try to find jobs for the affected employees in nearby Wal-Mart stores, and if that effort proved unsuccessful giving the employees 60 days worth of pay along with resume and interview training.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the American stores to be closed are "Wal-Mart Express" stores; only 12 U.S. Wal-Mart Supercenters and four Sam's Club stores will be shuttered.

<article id="0000246" published-at="2017-11-15" title="Alabama Republicans Pass Resolution In Support Of Senate Candidate Roy Moore"><p>National Republicans may be bailing on Senate candidate Roy Moore after nearly a week of sexual harassment accusations, strange interviews, and even a press conference involving Gloria Allred. But members of at least one Alabama GOP organization say they're standing by their man.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alreporter.com/2017/11/15/shelby-county-republican-executive-committee-votes-unanimously-support-judge-roy-moore/?platform=hootsuite" type="external">The Shelby County GOP issued a resolution Wednesday</a>, expressing support for Moore and listing reasons that members of the county and state Republican parties will continue to back the former judge in the race for Jeff Sessions's vacant Senate seat, even as the RNC ? and leadership within the "Republican uprising" ? question whether Moore remains a suitable candidate for office.</p>
<p>"We call on Republicans in Alabama to support Roy Moore and defeat the Democrat Party candidate," the resolution says. "So that our voice in Washington, D.C. will continue to be represented by a Republican who supports the Republican Party principles and platform we hold dear and who will push forward a conservative agenda that is best for the United States of America."</p>
<p>The resolution goes on to list the date of Roy Moore's primary win, and suggests that since he is the official choice of Alabama Republicans, he should remain in the race. The body of the resolution claims that Moore has been a "consistent proponent" of Republican positions on fiscal matters, abortion, and "family values."</p>
<p>WHEREAS, Roy Moore has been a consistent proponent of the positions of the Alabama Republican Party, including conservative fiscal policy, pro-life and traditional family values, less government regulations and interference ? with an emphasis on personal freedoms,</p>
<p>THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED BY the Executive Committee of the Shelby County Republican Party that we will assist and support Roy Moore in his efforts to win the U.S. Senate special election on December 12, 2017, and represent the great state of Alabama,</p>
<p>THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED BY the Executive Committee of the Shelby County Republican Party that we call on Republicans in Alabama to support Roy Moore and defeat the Democrat Party candidate so that our voice in Washington, D.C. will continue to be represented by a Republican who supports the Republican Party principles and platform we hold dear and who will push forward a conservative agenda that is best for the United States of America.</p>
<p>This is the second such local Republican resolution to emerge in as many days, as Alabama Republicans battle the national party to keep their chosen candidate ? even as accusations that a 30-year-old Moore preyed on high school-aged women while serving as a district attorney, pile up. The Winston County Republican Party Executive Committee passed their resolution on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Alabama Republican Steering Committee will officially decide later this week whether to drop Moore. They are expected to flout the national GOP and retain their chosen Senate candidate.</p></article>

So will the Chicago Reading Initiative, CPS? nearly decade-old approach to implementing balanced literacy that requires two hours of reading instruction a day in elementary and high schools. <a href="/news/index.php?item=1363&amp;amp;cat=30" type="external">That initiative has shown mixed results.</a></p>
<p>The new principles unveiled today dictate that each day, every student should:</p>
<p>* ?Read about something I like and understand?</p>
<p>* ?Write about something meaningful to me?</p>
<p>* ?Enjoy listening to an adult read aloud?</p>
<p>* ?Talk about what I read and write?</p>
<p>Dixon Elementary reading specialist Maureen Gallagher says she thinks the new principles are solid but present challenges:&amp;#160; ?Getting the amount of books in the classroom that children really need and getting teachers to [expand] their toolbox to implement as much reading as possible.?</p>
<p>Elizabeth Cardenas-Lopez, who manages the Striving Readers project, says CPS is having ?an ongoing conversation? about where additional funding for books might come from.</p>
<p>?If it doesn?t come from central office, hopefully it will come from principals, areas,? she says.</p>
<p>Debra Moriarty, director of student achievement at the non-profit Academy for Urban School Leadership, says that AUSL-run schools are already using similar principles. ?It is awesome [that we will] have the support and professional development that is needed for teachers to really implement this,? she says. ?They have to have a greater understanding of what it means to give an effective read-aloud, to have independent reading in their classroom.?</p>
<p>Nationally-known literacy specialist Richard Allington appeared at Thursday?s event at the Chicago History Museum to launch the initiative. (He came in conjunction with the American Reading Company, which pitched its classic children?s books to educators in attendance.)</p>
<p>Before Allington spoke, Paul Whitsitt, director of the Office of Reading and Language Arts, told the crowd that the district?s more complex, six-year-old reading instruction manual will still be used, though it will be updated and re-launched in late winter or early spring 2011. Teachers, he said, still need more professional development to understand the district?s strategies.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>But the new principles offer an ?emergency-level,? simple message that any teacher, administrator or parent can quickly use to check the quality of reading instruction, Whitsitt added.</p>
<p>Determining the right reading level for books for students to read can be challenging, Whitsitt said, but ?if a child?s enjoying what they are reading, they probably understand it,? which is important.</p>
<p>The framework will not create additional work for teachers, he said, but they should keep the principles in mind when creating lessons.</p>
<p>Allington described the poor quality of reading instruction he observed at a recent visit to a failing school district: ?In nine days, we never saw a child reading anything longer than a sentence, never saw a child writing anything longer than a sentence.? Children spent their time working on low-level worksheets.</p>
<p>While reading programs commonly available from publishing companies include an average of just 12 to 18 minutes a day of reading, students should be reading in school for at least an hour, or even two, each day, Allington said.</p>
<p>?That may be the reason you have low reading achievement,? he added. ?You?ve got [only] enough reading in a core reading program to get you through Monday.?</p>
<p>Someone who is reading at a 2nd-grade level for two hours a day should read 12 short children?s books each day, Allington pointed out, or about 750 books in a school year. By the same token, teachers should assign older students one or two (or more) chapter books a week, instead of spending several weeks ? or worse, months ? working through one book.</p>
<p>He also emphasized that teachers and students should engage each other in ?literate conversation.?&amp;#160; When adults talk about news articles, Allington pointed out, they rarely ask each other trivial questions like ?What was the title of the man from the mayors? office who was quoted in the third paragraph???</p>
<p>?Never ask a child a question you know the answer to,? he advised.</p>
<p>Struggling readers too often spend their time waiting to take their turn reading aloud (in ?round-robin? style, a strategy experts now widely consider to be ineffective), doing worksheets, and spending time on decoding drills.</p>
<p>To improve reading, Allington recommends that Chicago scrap workbooks, test prep and copied material like worksheets and instead give teachers ?$500 gift certificates to Barnes &amp;amp; Noble? to buy books for their classroom.</p>
<p>Other mistakes Allington said schools make when students have reading problems are:</p>
<p>* Relying too much on classroom aides. A study found that classes with aides actually had lower reading scores than those of the same size without aides ? a result Allington chalks up to teachers having aides work with struggling readers. ?We?ve got almost 50 years of research showing if you want kids to be stupid, put them with a paraprofessional,? he said.</p>
<p>* A lack of communication between classroom teachers and special education and bilingual teachers. Students can?t learn to read with just 30 minutes of good teaching a day but the rest ?crap,? Allington said. ?The teacher?s job is not to teach a 4th-grade reading curriculum. It?s to teach the children in front of her.?</p>
<p>* A lack of reading expertise on the part of special educators. ?Only 19 states require special education teachers to have even one course in teaching how to read,? Allington said. ?Special ed kids get less, and lower-quality, reading instruction than anyone else in the building. If you wanted a system that didn?t work, that would be a damn good plan.?</p>
<p>* Unequal treatment of struggling readers. One study found that teachers correct reading mistakes by good readers using a problem-solving approach ? asking questions like, ?Did that make sense?? But poor readers are interrupted eight times more often, usually the moment they utter the wrong sound ? causing them to read word-by-word, slowly, and with a hesitant tone that sounds like they are asking a question.</p>
<p>Allington slammed the federal Reading First program, as well, for its over-reliance on phonics and its use of the DIBELS (Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills) assessment. ?You don?t need to test kids to figure out where they are,? he said, noting that young children?s ?invented writing? of words ? usually filled with mistakes and non-letters ? provides a good sense of how much phonemic awareness they are developing.</p>
<p>After the event, principals and literacy specialists met in six break-out groups to share successful strategies for increasing children?s interaction with reading, writing, talking, and listening.</p>
<p>Buckingham Therapeutic Day School reading specialist Rosa Sutton told a group that when she noticed that books in the library were not being utilized as fully as they could be, she ?emptied the library to make sure there were enough books in the classroom.?</p>
<p>?It really increased the [classroom] library,? she says. ?You should have 35 to 40 books per child.?</p></article>

<article id="0000257" published-at="2017-08-01" title="Cuba stops issuing new permits for some private enterprises"><p>The Cuban government announced Tuesday that it was placing at least a temporary hold on the opening of a private sector that employs more than a half-million people and has become a significant force in the island economy.</p>
<p>Authorities will suspend the issuance of permits for a range of occupations and ventures, including restaurants and renting out rooms in private homes, the government said in the Communist Party newspaper Granma.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>The suspension includes the growing field of private teachers as well as street vendors of agricultural products, dressmakers and the relatively recent profession of real estate broker. The announcement did not say when the issuing of permits would resume and said that enterprises already in operation can continue.</p>
<p>"No one assumes that the goal of these measures is to roll back the development of self-employment in Cuba," the article said. "Nothing could be farther from reality."</p>
<p>Despite that assurance, there are fears that the move could have long-term consequences.</p>
<p>"It's only a stop sign along the road, but with a discouraging message even it is temporary," said economist Omar Everleny Perez. "The country needs more hopeful messages."</p>
<p>President Raul Castro expanded an opening of the economy to private-sector employment in 200 categories of business in 2010. The government says nearly 570,000 people are employed in the enterprises, including hundreds of restaurants and guest houses.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The most visible effect of the reforms was a huge increase in private rooms and guest houses, often nicer and with better services than the state-owned hotels, along with private restaurants catering to tourists around the country.</p>
<p>It helped fuel GDP growth of about 1 percent so far this year, following a dip last year, but officials have expressed concern about tax evasion and the use of raw materials from the black market in the growing segment.</p>
<p>Granma said that "putting the house in order is the highest priority of the Cuban state."</p></article>
<article id="0000261" published-at="2017-02-25" title="Democrats select Tom Perez as national chairman"><p>ATLANTA ? Democrats chose former Labor Secretary Tom Perez as their new national chairman Saturday over a liberal Minnesota congressman, capping a divisive campaign that reflected the depths of the party?s electoral failures as well as the energy from resistance to President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Perez, the first Latino to hold the post, edged Rep. Keith Ellison in the second round of voting by Democratic National Committee members gathered in Atlanta. The new chairman must rebuild a party that in the last decade has lost about 1,000 elected posts from the White House to Congress to the 50 statehouses, a power deficit Democrats have not seen nationally in 90 years.</p>
<p>In a nod to his winning margin of 35 votes out of 435 cast, to say nothing of the lingering friction between old-guard Democrats and outspoken upstarts, Perez tapped Ellison to serve as deputy chair.</p>
<p>?We are all in this together,? Perez said, calling on Democrats to fight ?the worst president in the history of the United States.?</p>
<p>Ellison, who had backing from many liberals, including 2016 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, added his own call for unity and noted that he and Perez both want to rebuild state and local Democratic parties across the country.</p>
<p>?We don?t have the luxury of walking out of this room divided,? Ellison said, as the erstwhile rivals stood together on stage as some young Ellison supporters jeered from the gallery.</p>
<p>Trump chimed in via Twitter: ?Congratulations to Thomas Perez, who has just been named Chairman of the DNC. I could not be happier for him, or for the Republican Party!?</p>
<p>Republicans control the White House, Congress and 33 governorships, while the GOP is one Senate confirmation from a conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Despite President Barack Obama?s personal electoral successes, the party suffered crushing defeats, losing the House majority in 2010 and the Senate in 2014.</p>
<p>Perez told party activists earlier in the day that Democrats face a ?crisis of confidence? and ?a crisis of relevance.?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The new chairman first entered the race upon urging from Obama and his inner circle. The former president released a statement praising both men after the vote.</p>
<p>?I know that Tom Perez will unite us under that banner of opportunity,? Obama said, ?and lay the groundwork for a new generation of Democratic leadership for this big, bold, inclusive, dynamic America we love so much.?</p>
<p>The son of Dominican immigrants, Perez comes to the job with a demonstrably liberal record as a civil rights attorney and backer of organized labor, but he carried the establishment label as a Maryland resident who?s spent years in the Washington orbit, working in the Justice Department and ultimately as an Obama Cabinet officer.</p>
<p>Former Vice President Joe Biden endorsed him; one of Obama?s closest aides, Valerie Jarrett, made calls to DNC members on Perez?s behalf as late as Friday night.</p>
<p>Perez will not be the undisputed ?leader of the party,? even with Democrats out of power.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California will remain the highest ranking Democrats in Washington. But Perez must now join with Schumer and Pelosi as part cheerleader, part fundraiser, part organizer and recruiter, part public messenger, helping frame the party?s arguments and identity, while charting a strategy to turn energy into votes in upcoming elections.</p>
<p>Perez and Ellison appeared together for a joint news conference afterward in a session that was originally planned to be the winner?s opportunity to address reporters. Perez said they ?are going to put our values in action? for a country he described as ?fearful? over Trump?s priorities.</p>
<p>Besides his endorsement from Sanders, who challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, Ellison had backing from Schumer, who is not regarded as a hero of party liberals.</p>
<p>Liberal groups that backed Ellison ranged from guarded to despondent with the outcome.</p>
<p>Sanders released a statement congratulating Perez but warned ?it is imperative that Tom understands that the same-old, same-old is not working.?</p>
<p>Jim Dean, chair of Democracy for America, called Perez?s election ?incredibly disappointing? and said the ?resistance will persist ? with or without the leadership of the Democratic National Committee.?</p>
<p>Jeff Weaver, who managed Sanders? presidential campaign and now runs the offshoot ?Our Revolution? group, said Perez and Ellison now must prove themselves as a leadership duo.</p>
<p>?Do they really invest in 50 state parties? Are they really going to engage with people in the streets?? Weaver asked. ?Are they really going to bring those people into the party, so that you have a much broader cross-section of Democratically aligned voters represented??</p>
<p>Ellison told reporters he ?trusts? Perez, and he encouraged liberal activists to do the same.</p>
<p>Perez succeeds Chairwoman Donna Brazile, who led the party as interim chief in the fallout from disclosure of the DNC hacking.</p>
<p>Brazile said the party has worked with cybersecurity experts to address vulnerabilities. She chided Trump for his mockery of DNC cybersecurity and his doubts that Russians are at fault, as U.S. intelligence officials have said.</p>
<p>?No, Donald Trump,? Brazile said, ?you can?t go to Staples and buy anti-Russian hacking software.?</p></article>
<article id="0000262" published-at="2012-01-19" title="Ex-wife says Gingrich wanted ?open marriage?"><p>AP Photo</p>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) ? Dredging up a past that Newt Gingrich has worked hard to bury, the GOP presidential candidate?s second ex-wife says Gingrich asked for an ?open marriage? in which he could have both a wife and a mistress.</p>
<p>In an interview with ABC News? ?Nightline? scheduled to air Thursday night, Marianne Gingrich said she refused to go along with the idea that she share her husband with Callista Bisek, who would later become his third wife.</p>
<p>The explosive interview was airing just two days before the presidential primary in South Carolina, a state with a strong Christian conservative bent, and as Gingrich tries to present himself as the strongest alternative to front-runner Mitt Romney.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>In excerpts of the interview released ahead the ABC broadcast, Marianne Gingrich said her husband conducted his affair with Callista ?in my bedroom in our apartment in Washington? while she was elsewhere.</p>
<p>?He always called me at night and always ended with ?I love you,'? she said. ?Well, she was listening.?</p>
<p>Marianne Gingrich, who was Gingrich?s second wife, said Gingrich told her ?Callista doesn?t care what I do.?</p>
<p>?He was asking to have an open marriage and I refused,? she said. ?That is not a marriage.?</p>
<p>She also said Gingrich moved to divorce her just months after she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p>?He also was advised by the doctor when I was sitting there that I was not to be under stress,? she said. ?He knew.?</p>
<p>Gingrich, asked by a voter Thursday about his past mistakes, said questions about his past life were inevitable but that he?d long since sought forgiveness. He said he expected attacks when he got into the race.</p>
<p>?We knew we would get beaten up,? he said while campaigning in Beaufort, S.C. ?We knew we?d get lied about. We knew we?d get smeared. We knew there would be nasty ads and we decided the country was worth the pain.?</p>
<p>Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond flatly rejected Marianne Gingrich?s account, saying: ?It couldn?t be any more opposite of the truth.?</p>
<p>He told reporters that he wouldn?t say anything against his ex-wife, but added that his two daughters from his first marriage had written to ABC to complain that the interview was ?tawdry and inappropriate.? He didn?t answer questions about the specifics of the interview, directing questions to his daughters.</p>
<p>In an interview Thursday with The Washington Post, Marianne Gingrich said that within days of asking for a divorce, her husband gave a speech in which he stressed the importance of ethics and family values in American culture.</p>
<p>?How could he ask me for a divorce on Monday and within 48 hours give a speech about family values and talk about how people treat people?? she said.</p>
<p>Marianne Gingrich said she and Gingrich went to marriage counseling after he asked for the divorce, but that he wavered over what to do and asked for an open marriage to allow him to see whoever he wanted.</p>
<p>She said she decided to go public about the details from their marriage now in order ?to get out there about who I was, so Newt couldn?t create me as an evil, awful person, which was starting to happen.?</p>
<p>Hammond, the Gingrich spokesman, told the AP on Thursday afternoon that the candidate had never asked for an open marriage.</p>
<p>?Divorces are very tough and people have very different recollections of how things happen,? he said.</p>
<p>Marianne Gingrich has said that Gingrich proposed to her before the divorce from his first wife was final in 1981; they were married six months later. Her marriage to Gingrich ended in divorce in 2000, and Gingrich has acknowledged he?d already taken up with Bisek, a former congressional aide.</p>
<p>The House speaker who pilloried President Bill Clinton for his affair with Monica Lewinsky was himself having an affair at the time.</p>
<p>As plans to air the interview were disclosed, Gingrich?s campaign released a statement from his daughters, Kathy Lubbers and Jackie Cushman, suggesting that Marianne Gingrich?s comments may be suspect given the emotional toll that divorce takes on everyone involved.</p>
<p>?Anyone who has had that experience understands it is a personal tragedy filled with regrets, and sometimes differing memories of events. We will not say anything negative about our father?s ex-wife,? they said. ?He has said before, privately and publicly, that he regrets any pain he may have caused in the past to people he loves.?</p>
<p>Gingrich has worked in recent years to present himself as changed man, offering himself in this campaign as a 68-year-old grandfather who has settled down with wife No. 3 and embraced God through Catholicism.</p>
<p>Last year, he said it would be up to voters to decide whether to hold his past against him.</p>
<p>?I think people have to look at me, ask tough questions, then render judgment,? he said then.</p>
<p>But he may not have been banking on his ex-wife, who has been silent so far in the 2012 campaign, to re-start that conversation.</p>
<p>A message seeking comment from Marianne Gingrich was not immediately returned.</p></article>

<p>?I?m involved in all kinds,? the Florida native says. ?I?m passionate about voting rights and ensuring progressive candidates are elected in future elections.?</p>
<p>Through mutual activists, Kreidich met Vicki Braun two weeks ago and found out about the Concerned Citizens for LGBT Safety and Rights March, which will be held Sunday, March 12 from 10 a.m.-1 p.m. at Lafayette Square in Washington (H and 17th streets, N.W.). The march to Logan Circle will begin at 10:45 a.m. where a short rally will take place.</p>
<p>Braun was inspired by recent trans murders in the South and Kreidich agreed to help organize the event.</p>
<p>?Not long ago, I was walking around Rehoboth Beach holding hands with my wife, Susannah, and we were harassed,? Kreidich says. ?So this is a real concern for all.

<article id="0000264" published-at="2016-03-05" title="Colleges Worsen Income Inequality"><p></p>
<p>Tuition gouging for degrees that are useless in the real world and a failed business model have put U.S. colleges front and center as exacerbating income inequality.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>Many college students are increasingly getting priced out of getting the very same skills elected officials in Washington, D.C. have strenuously argued are needed to stop rising pay gaps.</p>
<p>Annual private college costs have surged 24% over the last ten years, to $40,917 on average, and are up 37% for public universities, to $18,391, data from the College Board show. At the same time, median U.S. household income has steadily dropped 5.7% from 2003 to 2013.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, student unemployment worsened over the last decade: The 20-to-24-age bracket saw jobless rates rising to 11.1% from 9.5% in 2003, and for 25 and older, it grew a percentage point to 5.6%.</p>
<p>Over the decades, college officials have used their nonprofit status to build an unsustainable business model more akin to hoteliers, one that real estate mogul Donald Trump would envy. And all on the backs of taxpayers, students and their families.</p>
<p>Schools across the U.S. offer practical degrees, useful in the corporate or public sector, like engineering, software design, or accounting.&amp;#160; But even the most prestigious colleges no longer offer a solid liberal arts education. Instead, many schools charge nosebleed tuition for degrees built on useless courses about, say, the cultural efficacy of soap operas, or sex and gender in society, that don?t lead to work in the real world and exacerbate income inequality.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The broken college business model has dire consequences, as students face a brutally-competitive job market in the wake of the worst financial collapse since the Great Depression. Solid, practical degrees are more important than ever, as ?young adults change jobs on average 11 times in the first 25 years of their adult lives,? notes George Leef, director of research for the&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.popecenter.org/" type="external">John William Pope Center for Higher Education Policy Opens a New Window.</a>.</p>
<p>A top college watchdog, the American Council of Trustees and Alumni (ACTA), adds: ?It is a tragedy that our colleges and universities are increasingly characterized by their high costs, not their high standards,? adding, ?it is time to demand improvement.?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, income inequality is rampant for those without college degrees. Employees with just a high-school diploma earn just two-thirds of the typical salary of college graduates, down from 81% in 1965, the earliest year for available data, says the Pew Research Center.&amp;#160;Young adults with high-school diplomas face three times the likelihood of living in poverty than they did 35 years ago, Pew says.</p>
<p>Another disturbing headline: The era of the four-year college education is over. ACTA says: ?Six years is the norm used by the U.S. Department of Education? with ?far too many? students taking even longer to graduate, burdening families even more.</p>
<p>Ask yourself: Where is it written in the tax code that a college?s nonprofit status means it should prioritize spending on bling over reducing tuition?</p>
<p>Why are taxpayers, students and their families subsidizing commercial activity at colleges, when these schools get so much federal and state aid on top of tax breaks?</p>
<p>Where are the Congressional hearings into tax breaks meant for colleges operating solely for educational purposes ? a mission that is supposed to help solve income inequality?</p>
<p>DC Ignores Incentives Problem</p>
<p>The student debt bubble has blown to $1.2 trillion, as Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren, Al Franken, and Richard Durbin push for new legislation to help student borrowers, including more tax increases on upper brackets to help pay for student debt.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama has already issued an executive order to extend caps on student borrowers? repayments at 10% of their monthly income. Seven in 10 college seniors graduating last year had student loan debt. Those graduates owed an average of $29,400 each, according to the Project on Student Debt.</p>
<p>But this is a story about incentives, not after-the-fact fixes. College officials are hiking tuition costs even though they operate their schools as nonprofits, and even though students get substantial federal and state aid.</p>
<p>Colleges and universities get a lot of tax breaks. They are exempt from paying federal corporate income taxes, state and local sales taxes, and property taxes. Their endowments accept tax-deductible contributions and they don?t have to pay capital gains taxes on these funds. Also, colleges can borrow money using tax-exempt bonds and they do not have to pay taxes on the interest they earn.</p>
<p>This, as numerous schools, including Harvard University ($58,600 for tuition, room and board), Stanford University ($56,446) and Yale University ($60,900), sit on multi-billion dollar endowments that rival the size of many hedge funds.</p>
<p>At the same time, college students got $136.7 billion in federal and state grants to pay for their degrees in 2012 and 2013 (see <a href="https://trends.collegeboard.org/student-aid/figures-tables/total-student-aid-and-nonfederal-loans-current-dollars-over-time" type="external">here Opens a New Window.</a>). Often, when students approach colleges for help, they instead get stuck with loans, anecdotal evidence shows.</p>
<p>Degrees in Studying Lady Gaga, Mad Men</p>
<p>In its <a href="http://cew.georgetown.edu/unemployment2013" type="external">report Opens a New Window.</a> last year, ?Hard Times: College Majors, Unemployment and Earnings? Georgetown University concluded income inequality was an issue for college grads with certain degrees: ?Today, what you make depends on what you take.?&amp;#160; It found that ?unemployment is generally higher for non-technical majors,? such as the arts (9.8%) or law and public policy (9.2%).?</p>
<p>Specifically, it reported low median earnings in the $50,000 range for majors in the humanities and liberal arts, psychology and communications, vs. the $75,000 to $83,000 range for college grads majoring in computers, mathematics, and engineering .</p>
<p>Georgetown also found joblessness is high for film and photography majors, as well as for grads majoring in anthropology, architecture and political science, whereas&amp;#160; joblessness was low for grads with degrees in mathematics (5.9%) and computer science (8.7%) (for more, see <a href="http://cew.georgetown.edu/unemployment2013" type="external">here Opens a New Window.</a>).</p>
<p>ACTA?s latest <a href="http://www.goacta.org/initiatives/what_will_they_learn" type="external">What Will They Learn? Opens a New Window.</a> report finds ?do it yourself? curriculums -- where students pick their own curriculums -- are in vogue. Partly because of that, just 2%, 22, of the 1,091 colleges and universities studied, got an A grade for offering the basic requirements students need for a decent education, according to this scale. The A list included Pepperdine University ($44,902), Morehouse College ($25,468) and Baylor University ($34,480). The U.S. military Academy also scored an A.</p>
<p>The basic standards are: English composition, literature, foreign language, U.S. government or history, economics, mathematics, and natural or physical science. If schools offered six or seven of these basic requirements, they got an A. If just two were offered, that meant a D grade; just one resulted in an F.</p>
<p>More than a third, 35.5% or 387 schools, got a B grade, 30.8% a C, 23.4% a D, and 8.3% an F, ACTA found.</p>
<p>The blue-chip colleges in America got dismal grades even though annual costs easily top the $55,000 threshold.&amp;#160; Harvard and Yale both got a D. The University of California at Berkeley ($27,386 for out-of-state students) and Brown University ($46,408) both scored an F.</p>
<p>?Brown has an ?open curriculum,? meaning students may take whatever classes they wish, with no requirements at all,? ACTA reports. The John William Pope Center?s Leef notes that: ?At Berkeley, for example, a student can graduate without cracking open a great novel, speaking even a few words of a foreign language, understanding statistics or knowing anything that happened more than a week ago.?</p>
<p>Most of the state universities in Michigan and Wisconsin scored Cs, Ds or Fs.</p>
<p>One of the most expensive colleges studied, Amherst College, ($46,574), did not require a single one of ACTA?s seven core subjects. Instead, Amherst?s curriculum lets students ?confront the meaning of his or her education, and does it without imposing a particular course or subject on all students,? ACTA says.</p>
<p>Leef also points out that a study done by his center found that the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill sells these impractical courses: The Stage Musicals of Rodgers and Hammerstein; Food in American Culture; The History of Hip-Hop Culture; Sex and Gender in Society; and Guerrillas and Revolution in 20th Century Latin America.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;ACTA also says that at the University of Indiana?Bloomington, students can fulfill their ?Social and Historical Breadth of Inquiry? requirement by taking a course in ?The Fame Monster: The Cultural Politics of Lady Gaga.?</p>
<p>At Middlebury College, students can satisfy their ?Historical Studies? requirement by enrolling in the course ?Blame It On Bossa Nova: The History of a Transnational Phenomenon? or by taking ?Mad Men and Mad Women,? which uses AMC?s ?Mad Men? ?as a course foundation.?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a recent survey of college graduates ?found that barely half knew that the U.S. Constitution established the separation of powers,? the college watchdog ACTA says. ?Only 38% could identify the correct length of congressional terms of office.?</p>
<p>College Bling</p>
<p>But instead of focusing on lowering tuition costs and improving their course offerings, many colleges are more interested in splashy college bling in the form of white elephant football stadiums, four-star college cafeterias, and sports complexes on the level of a Chelsea Piers in New York City.</p>
<p>All while an excess of administrators continues to help drive tuition costs and student debt higher, and all of which is pricing students out of an education they need to stop the very same income inequality politicians are outraged about.</p>
<p>University officials argue their bling polishes their brand names and attracts students. However, students increasingly subsidize these expenditures, as private donations and ticket sales repeatedly fail to meet projected costs.</p>
<p>Annual National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) industry revenue from tickets, television, and merchandising is more than $15 billion, Bloomberg figures show. And that has colleges blowing out their arenas. The University of California at Berkeley spent $474 million on a new football stadium two years ago. This, after state legislators cut $650 million from the university system's $3-billion budget, causing tuition costs to rise 17% for in-state students, and 5% for nonresidents.</p>
<p>Colorado State University is working on a $220 million football stadium expected to be finished by 2016 as tuition costs bear down. It is estimated colleges in Texas are spending more than a billion dollars on football arenas (see <a href="http://sportsblogs.star-telegram.com/mac-engel/2014/08/sellout-texas-has-spent-more-than-1-billion-on-college-football-stadiums.html" type="external">here Opens a New Window.</a>).</p>
<p>Student athletes, of course, get more help than regular students. Recently, the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics estimated that Division I schools with football programs spend about $91,900 per athlete, roughly seven times the spending per student of $13,600.</p>
<p>Reports indicate that NCAA data reveal just 16.2% of the spending at Division 1 schools with football teams actually goes to student aid. The rest goes to salaries, game expenses, and facilities. The highest-paid college officials increasingly are coaches.</p>
<p>Colleges from the University of Texas at Austin to UCLA to Yale have reinvented the standard cafeteria into restaurant-style eateries. No more steam tables for meat loaf or pasta. Now, espresso makers, sushi bars, roast beef or turkey stations, vegan bars and designer sundae stations are increasingly the norm.</p>
<p>Oklahoma City University has a raw vegan bar. The University of California at San Diego has a vegan ?eatery and lounge? on campus. The University of North Texas turned one of its dining halls into an all-vegan cafeteria. High Point University in North Carolina even has a four-star level restaurant, 1924 Prime Steakhouse.</p>
<p>Colleges are also building out state-of-the art gym facilities, with Olympic-size pools, saunas, Jacuzzis, expansive weight rooms, aerobics and yoga centers, and a string of squash, racquetball, basketball, volleyball and tennis courts.</p></article>

<article id="0000269" published-at="2017-07-19" title="Trump warns Senate Republicans about dire consequences of failure to pass health care bill"><p>A combative President <a href="/topics/donald-trump/" type="external">Trump</a> launched an urgent, last-ditch bid Wednesday to revive an Obamacare repeal effort that had been left for dead just 24 hours earlier, imploring <a href="/topics/senate/" type="external">Senate</a> Republicans to stay in Washington until the job is done and warning that failure would decimate the party and its agenda.</p>
<p>?I?m ready to act,? <a href="/topics/donald-trump/" type="external">Mr. Trump</a> said at the <a href="/topics/white-house/" type="external">White House</a>. ?For seven years you?ve promised the American people that you would repeal Obamacare. People are hurting. Inaction is not an option.?</p>
<p>The urgent public plea marked a confrontational shift in tone for <a href="/topics/donald-trump/" type="external">Mr. Trump</a>, who had been lobbying senators mainly behind the scenes, and a renewed commitment to the effort. One day earlier, <a href="/topics/donald-trump/" type="external">Mr. Trump</a> said Republicans should force Democrats to own Obamacare by letting it collapse under its unsustainable weight.</p>
<p><a href="/news/2017/jul/19/donald-trump-hosting-gop-senators-white-house-obam/" type="external">SEE ALSO: Trump hosting GOP senators at White House on Obamacare repeal</a></p>
<p><a href="/topics/donald-trump/" type="external">Mr. Trump</a> got personal at times, leaning into Sen. Dean Heller, a Nevada Republican who faces a tough re-election battle next year and is wary of backing the repeal-and-replace effort.</p>
<p>?He wants to remain a senator, doesn?t he?? <a href="/topics/donald-trump/" type="external">Mr. Trump</a> said to laughter.</p>
<p>It?s unclear whether the eleventh-hour gambit will work. Several moderates are still concerned about reining in the Medicaid program for the poor, while a Plan B to repeal Obamacare now and replace it later would sow uncertainty in the insurance markets and leave more than 30 million Americans without health care coverage by 2026, according to budget estimates.</p>
<p><a href="/topics/senate/" type="external">Senate</a> Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said he will force his members to stand up and be counted next week when he moves to bring a House-passed health care bill to the floor to kick-start debate on <a href="/topics/senate/" type="external">Senate</a> measures.</p>
<p>?We cannot keep the commitment we?ve made to the American people to repeal and replace Obamacare unless we get on the bill,? Mr. McConnell said.</p>
<p>A sufficient number of Republicans had threatened to link arms with Democrats and sink efforts to bring a replacement bill or a fallback plan that would gut Obamacare and give Congress two years to devise a new program.</p>
<p>Sen. Susan M. Collins of Maine was the only Republican to object to both options, at least openly, so Republican leaders could be hoping to leave things flexible enough to avoid more than two defections from their 52-seat majority for the procedural motion, with Vice President Mike Pence serving as a tie-breaker if necessary.</p>
<p>?There is a large majority in our conference that want to demonstrate to the American people that they intend to keep the commitment they made in four straight elections to repeal Obamacare,? Mr. McConnell said. ?I think we all agree it?s better to both repeal and replace. But we could have a vote on either.?</p>
<p>Senators are free to offer a plethora of amendments once the chamber takes up either plan, leaders said, so Republicans will have options and can vote to tweak the underlying proposals.</p>
<p>?Any senator who votes against starting debate is really telling America that you?re fine with Obamacare,? <a href="/topics/donald-trump/" type="external">Mr. Trump</a> said.</p>
<p>Conservative groups furious at wavering Republicans piled on. Some threatened to present <a href="/topics/senate/" type="external">Senate</a> Republicans who resist repeal with busts of Benedict Arnold, the Revolutionary War turncoat.</p>
<p>?They have to choose. Do they want to be traitors? Do they want to be the next Arlen Specters or Charlie Crists?? said Club for Growth President David McIntosh, referring to notable Republicans who switched to the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Yet some moderate Republicans are itching to move on. They say party leaders should return to regular order and include Democrats, governors and other stakeholders in the health care reform process after attempts to draft an Obamacare replacement in secret and pass it on Republican votes alone fell short.</p>
<p>?I?d like to get some hearings going in the health committee,? Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Alaska Republican, said Wednesday on her way to a floor vote.</p>
<p>Sen. Lamar Alexander, Tennessee Republican and chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said he will schedule hearings on ways to stabilize the insurance markets in the short term, regardless of how the vote turns out next week.</p>
<p>Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican whose recent surgery forced him to recover at home this week, also called on <a href="/topics/senate/" type="external">Senate</a> leaders to ?receive input from members of both parties.?</p>
<p>The Congressional Budget Office said the replacement plan that stalled this week would have resulted in 22 million fewer people holding insurance a decade from now. The ?repeal, then replace? option would result in 32 million fewer Americans with coverage, the CBO said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The CBO said the repeal-only plan ? President Obama vetoed an identical one about 18 months ago ? would save $473 billion, but premiums would increase by 25 percent compared with current law in 2018, by 50 percent in 2020 and double by 2026.</p>
<p>Also Wednesday, The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey showed only 13 percent of Americans support repealing the health care law without a replacement in hand. It said 8 in 10 believe Republicans should offer to negotiate with Democrats if their own effort fails.</p>
<p>Democrats said Republicans should cut their losses and work on bipartisan fixes to the current program, which failed to attract enough young and healthy people in the early rounds.</p>
<p><a href="/topics/senate/" type="external">Senate</a> Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, said allowing the markets to crumble, as <a href="/topics/donald-trump/" type="external">Mr. Trump</a> suggested before renewing his replacement push, would be unconscionable.</p>
<p>?President <a href="/topics/donald-trump/" type="external">Trump</a>?s promise to let our health care system collapse is so, so wrong on three counts,? he said. ?It?s a failure morally, it?s a failure politically and it?s a remarkable failure of presidential leadership.?</p>
<p>The <a href="/topics/white-house/" type="external">White House</a> said it would make the latest round of cost-sharing payments that reimburse insurers that lose money on low-income customers? costs, but it hasn?t made a long-term commitment to the payments.</p>
<p>Mr. Schumer urged Congress to do three things immediately to prop up the markets: guarantee funding for cost-sharing payments, establish a reinsurance program that backstops insurers that take on high-cost customers and let people in counties without any insurers on their Obamacare exchanges shop on the D.C. small-business portal that members of Congress use.</p>
<p>?These proposals are specific, nonideological and could pass quickly and make life better for millions of Americans,? he said.</p>
<p>But conservatives said if <a href="/topics/senate/" type="external">Senate</a> Republicans continue to flounder on repeal, the near-term fight is to block Democratic measures that look like more Obamacare.</p>
<p>?Make no mistake, when lawmakers call for ?bipartisan market stabilization? they mean more taxpayer money and more regulations,? said Heritage Action for America, a conservative pressure group. ?That approach is unacceptable.?</p>
<p>A slate of Republican holdouts were scheduled to huddle in the Capitol late Wednesday, hoping to make progress on the replacement effort.</p>
<p><a href="/topics/white-house/" type="external">White House</a> legislative affairs director Marc Short said the president discussed with <a href="/topics/senate/" type="external">Senate</a> Republicans the devolving of Medicaid programs to states to give them more flexibility, and an amendment put forward by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah designed to drive down premiums.</p>
<p>Mr. Short said any proposed legislation will retain a stipulation that tax credits cannot be used for abortion funding and will include a one-year ban on federal funding for Planned Parenthood.</p>
<p>Despite long odds, some <a href="/topics/senate/" type="external">Senate</a> Republicans said the <a href="/topics/white-house/" type="external">White House</a> summit gave the repeal-and-replace effort new life.</p>
<p>?Sometimes when you are facing defeat and nobody wants to accept it, that prompts people to rethink positions, open up their minds,? said Sen. Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Republican. ?People talk, another accommodation here or there ? we want to get a result, we all want to fix this problem. We?re just not giving up. I think that?s a good thing, isn?t it??</p>

<article id="0000270" published-at="2016-05-09" title="U.S. Crude Rises on Canadian Wildfire Outages and Saudi Reshuffle"><p></p>
<p>Oil rose on Monday after Canada's most destructive wildfire in recent memory knocked out over a million barrels in daily production capacity, but caution among investors prevented a return to late April's 2016 price highs.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>The lost capacity is equivalent to well over a third of the country's typical daily production, and almost all of Canada's crude from oil sands is exported to the United States.</p>
<p>U.S. crude futures rose 65 cents to $45.31 a barrel by 1118 GMT, having risen earlier by as much as $1.28, while Brent crude futures gained 40 cents to trade at $45.77 a barrel.</p>
<p>The fire, which broke out on May 1, has forced three major oil firms to warn they will be unable to deliver on some contracts for Canadian crude.</p>
<p>The impact of the production loss has been far more marked in the U.S. crude market, where prices for West Texas Intermediate oil for delivery in July are now above those for Brent.</p>
<p>Investors now hold near-record high bets on a rising oil price, which analysts say might mean there is less scope for Brent to rally after having gained 25 percent in a month.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>"Positioning has been already very stretched in the oil market ... Some must have taken the opportunity to exit, so that's one angle that momentum is slowing down," Barclays Capital commodities strategist Miswin Mahesh said.</p>
<p>"There is a slight fear that prices have recovered too quickly, and we risk repeating the same price trajectory seen around Q2 2015, where the rally slowed down the market balancing process," he added.</p>
<p>Canadian officials on Sunday showed some optimism as favorable weather helped fire fighters, driving the flames away from the oil sands town Fort McMurray, but there was no timeline for a restart of operations at evacuated sites.</p>
<p>"The market is close to balanced ... when we consider the large amount of supply offline in Canada and elsewhere, which could last for months," Morgan Stanley said.</p>
<p>U.S. shale oil output is in decline and production is also falling in Latin America, Asia and Nigeria, eroding a 1-2 million barrels per day supply overhang that pulled down oil prices by 70 percent between 2014 and early 2016.</p>
<p>Markets were also watching Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, where a government shake-up over the weekend included the appointment of Khalid al-Falih as head of the new Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources.</p>
<p>"Changes in Saudi Arabia oil leadership only underscore the shift in strategy to one focused on market share over price," Morgan Stanley said.</p>

<article id="0000271" published-at="2016-08-19" title="The 10 Top Nasdaq 100 Dividend Stocks: Do Any Belong in Your Portfolio?"><p></p>
<p>Image source: Getty Images.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>Historically, the Nasdaq 100 hasn't been well-known as a habitat for dividend stocks. The tech-heavy exchange was full of companies that tended to reinvest their profits into growth projects rather than returning capital to shareholders. But in recent years, more Nasdaq-listed companies have are looking at dividends as a critical part of their total return success.</p>
<p>Below, we examine the 10 top-yielding dividend stocks in the Nasdaq 100 today, with an eye toward identifying whether any of them give you the combination of income and growth prospects that make them ideal candidates for your portfolio.</p>
<p>Here are the 10 highest-yielding stocks among the Nasdaq 100 as of Aug. 18:</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Data source: Yahoo! Finance.</p>
<p>The most obvious thing about this chart is the huge lead that Seagate Technology has over its Nasdaq 100 brethren. The maker of hard-disk drives and other data storage products has long been on many investors' danger lists in terms of expectations for a dividend cut in the future, especially because the company has been under considerable pressure as the mobile revolution reduces the importance of PCs, with their traditional reliance on hard drives for storage. In addition, Seagate's free cash flow has been less than its dividend payments in the first two quarters of 2016.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, such a high yield would indeed be a danger sign. However, Seagate has actually seen its yield drop from double-digit percentages earlier this year as the stock recovered somewhat from lows below $19 a share, and optimism about the company's prospects are the primary cause. <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/08/05/how-seagate-technology-plc-gained-31-in-july.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness" type="external">Investors were pleased by Seagate's recent restructuring announcements Opens a New Window.</a>, and even though the company expects to reduce production of hard drives, it is looking at focusing more on high-end enterprise applications, which carry higher margins. In addition, efforts to expand its exposure to flash memory and solid-state drives could represent growth opportunities for Seagate as well. Rival Western Digital has also seen some positive movement in its share price, and although its yield also remains high, rays of hope have emerged for the data storage industry.</p>
<p>Another trend you can see in this list of stocks is that it includes many former high-flyers that have come upon tough times. In the semiconductor industry, for instance, Qualcomm and Intel are both going through the pains of adapting to changing conditions in the PC and mobile chip businesses. Cisco has seen similar changes afflict its networking hardware unit. Yet an recently improving tech sector has lifted those stocks and sent their yields lower compared to where they were early in 2016.</p>
<p>Among the stocks above, however, there are some interesting growth candidates. <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/07/06/corporate-profits-in-britain-could-soar-and-brexit.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness" type="external">Vodafone has struggled due to competitive pressure Opens a New Window.</a> in the European wireless telecom market, but the decline in the British pound could bolster its profits due to favorable foreign-exchange impacts and help send the stock higher. Moreover, expansion efforts in emerging markets in Africa, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region could also add to growth. Even though Vodafone no longer has its exposure to the U.S. market after selling its minority stake in Verizon Wireless, the British telecom arguably has even better prospects because of the potential in many underserved emerging markets.</p>
<p>At the same time, Paychex has exposure to the strong U.S. economy. By offering payroll services to employers, especially small and mid-sized businesses, Paychex keeps its finger on the pulse of American employment trends. As job growth has increased and the economy has recovered from the financial crisis, Paychex has been able to sustaining its own growth. With the U.S. still outpacing its peers overseas economically, Paychex offers not only an attractive yield but also plenty of possibilities for rising share prices.</p>
<p>For dividend investors looking at the Nasdaq as a source of stock ideas, the index's traditional aversion to dividends has almost entirely disappeared. By focusing on the stocks with the best growth prospects, however, you'll ensure that you not only get paid while you wait for companies to reach their full potential but also enjoy share-price appreciation when they succeed in their growth goals. Seagate offers that mix for those who are willing to assume the execution risk of the storage-device maker's turnaround efforts, and both Vodafone and Paychex also have opportunities to expand their respective businesses to give dividend investors even more of what they want in the months and years ahead.</p>

<article id="0000272" published-at="2017-08-18" title="WATCH: Cops Raid Wrong House, Assault Pregnant Woman &amp; Destroy Her Property"><p>Sacramento, CA ? Body camera footage has now been released by the Sacramento police department showing the moments leading up to the moment police decided to invade&amp;#160;Zityrua Abraham?s apartment. The police threw the pregnant woman to the ground in the process of kicking down the door of the home they believed the suspect they were pursuing had just entered.</p>
<p>Commentary by Jon Masters,</p>
<p>As previously reported&amp;#160;she and her family were outside their apartment, and Abraham noticed the police, but all of a sudden they came rushing in. She said the person they were really looking for was in an adjacent building. Nevertheless, she attempted to tell the police that she had an 18-month old child sleeping in the bedroom. However, according to Abraham, they didn?t care.</p>
<p>After one of the officers threw her to the ground, throwing her on her stomach, she began having contractions. ?The doctor said the way that I landed, my body twisted the wrong way ?cause my left side hurts, and I landed all right here on my right side,? she said at the time of the incident.</p>
<p>Once officers gained entry into the home, by kicking down the door, they apprehended her mother?s boyfriend. Police officers told her that her mother?s boyfriend looked like a car thief suspect they were pursuing. Her mother?s boyfriend had entered their apartment to get a glass of water just before police stormed in after him.</p>
<p>Abraham went immediately to local&amp;#160; <a href="http://fox40.com/2017/08/17/body-camera-video-released-in-sacramento-police-incident-involving-pregnant-woman/" type="external">News Channel Fox 40</a>&amp;#160;to decry the treatment she received by those sworn to protect and serve her best interests. According to the news reports, police blamed Abraham for getting in the way. Sgt. Bryce Heinlein reflected on the events of the day telling reporters:</p>
<p>At that point one of the officers grabbed the female by the arm. During that time she fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Abraham scoffs at the notion she somehow fell down on her own accord. She responded:</p>
<p>I have a baby in my stomach, I?m not fixing to just fall or exaggeratedly fall.&amp;#160; I?m not fixing to do anything to harm my son.</p>
<p>When asked if the actions of the officer who allegedly threw her to the ground where appropriate Heinlein said:</p>
<p>To this day, Abraham maintains her innocence and says the whole home invasion/arrest of her mother?s boyfriend caught her off-guard. She rejects any notion that she and her family are somehow, someway, to blame for what happened when police mistook her mom?s boyfriend for their suspect. She said:</p>
<p>I wasn?t in the way. I was telling them this is my home, trying to figure out what?s going on. I got a 1-year-old that lives here. We wasn?t doing nothing but minding our business that day.</p>
<p>Making matters worse for Abraham, when police entered her apartment they kicked down the door and did not fix it. Luckily, however, neighbors were more helpful than police and actually nailed the frame back together while she was in the hospital.</p>
<p>?I knew they were going to try to justify this whole thing. Right is right and wrong is wrong and. That was wrong what they did, all the way around,? said Abraham.</p>
<p>As you watch the video below, remember, none of the people involved in this raid had committed a crime and no one was arrested ? yet all their lives were put in danger thanks to the blatant incompetence of the police.</p>

<p>When Mike Harrington rose to speak, in that piercing alto of his, we all felt that the familiar language of socialism took on the complexion of youth, the freshness of truth. For a moment, it seemed as if all the shame and defeats of our century were erased, and the soaring hope of early socialism rang clear. Not that Mike didn?t live, every minute of his days, with a full consciousness of how terrible this century had been; that consciousness bore down upon his every opinion and decision; it kept prodding him into revisions of thought and perspective. Still, he had the extraordinary capacity?it almost seemed a gift of nature?to lift the concerns of daily realism into a transcendent realm, the optimism of a man who has blinked nothing, yet, as a tempered democrat, lives by his margin of hope.</p>

<article id="0000274" published-at="2016-07-17" title="A Prime Day to Celebrate the Boss?s Business"><p>Moving merchandise for Amazon in the Washington Post.</p>
<p>Amazon.com rang up its biggest sales day ever on Tuesday as shoppers hit up its <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2016/07/12/amazons-prime-day-is-here-with-100000-deals-and-a-lot-of-hype/" type="external">Prime Day event</a>, a day-long pageant of deals available only to members of its Prime subscription program.</p>
<p>That was the lead on a news story in the Washington Post ( <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2016/07/13/prime-day-sets-sales-record-for-amazon/" type="external">7/13/16</a>)?owned, of course, by Amazon CEO <a href="" type="internal">Jeff Bezos</a>.</p>
<p>And the story discloses that parenthetically: ?(Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, owns the Washington Post.)? But there seems to be some confusion: While welcome, disclosure is not an inoculation. We still look askance at a news story with lines like, ?That the sale drew such strong spending from shoppers for a second year suggests that Amazon is making inroads establishing this as an appointment summer shopping event.?</p>
<p>When the closest thing to a critical angle is to note that some people were angry that a challenging checkout process meant ?they weren?t able to take advantage of the deals,? we?ve gone beyond the sort of a problem that mere disclosure can fix.</p>

<article id="0000275" title="?I?m Using Alternative Stats?: The Daily Show Visits the Super Bowl to Mix Politics and Sports"><p>The Media Night at the Super Bowl is the perfect opportunity for late night shows to do some man-on-the-street work; and as Guillermo of Jimmy Kimmel Live <a href="" type="internal">showed us earlier this week</a>, the players involved with the big game are often times willing to go along with the fun.</p>
<p>We?re just two days away from Super Bowl LI between the Atlanta Falcons and New England Patriots, and Roy Wood Jr. of The Daily Show used the opportunity to get away from politics a little bit. But as he found out, it?s tough for any political journalist simply to leave behind the worlds of Beltway mania&amp;#160;during these strange and unconventional times.</p>
<p>As such, Wood Jr.?s segment blurred the lines between the big game and the cacophony of headlines stemming from the administration of President Donald Trump. At one point, he pressed Falcons cornerback Jalen Collins on the blatantly false number of fumbles in a game, to which Roy Wood quickly clarified: ?I?m suing alternative stats.?</p>
<p>?It?s gotta be real, it?s on the paper,? he offered, <a href="" type="internal">mocking Kellyanne Conway?s Meet The Press slip-up</a>.</p>
<p>For help leaving the political journalism behind, he turned to Fox Sports 1?s Katie Nolan for a pep-talk before acknowledging to one cameraman, ?It?s exciting right! The whole world?s on fire outside, but here we are.? He celebrated the fact that inside the Media Night festivities, ?There was nothing to remind me of Donald Trump?s awful policies.?</p>
<p>That is, until he sees one of the President?s pals up close and personal: ?Ah shit, it?s Tom Brady.? Watch above via Comedy Central.</p>

<article id="0000279" published-at="2010-07-04" title="On Fourth of July, Let Iraq Go"><p>The Fourth of July celebrates the Declaration of Independence of the American colonies of Great Britain, on the grounds that they deserved representative government and popular sovereignty? something denied to them by the British crown.</p>
<p>Iraq was occupied by American troops in 2003 after an illegal invasion, and it is still so occupied. The viceroy appointed by George W. Bush, Paul Bremer, had no legal charter from the US Congress and represented no one, having never been elected to anything. He wrote dozens of laws for the Iraqis by fiat. They are still technically the law of the land in Iraq. He used Iraq?s oil revenue, billions of dollars worth, to run his interim government, even though no Iraqi voted to give it to him for that purpose. In subsequent years the US intervened heavy-handedly in Iraqi political affairs and still does so today. Few complaints of the Founding Fathers against Britain could not be lodged against the United States by Iraq.</p>
<p>All through spring of 2009, US officers in Iraq heavily lobbied the new president, Barack Obama, not to honor the Status of Forces Agreement that George W. Bush had negotiated with the Iraqi parliament during his last months in office. It called for troop reductions. The officers opposed them. It called for US forces to cease actively patrolling major Iraqi cities on June 30, 2009. the officers said that step was foolhardy, and would make it impossible to keep up their collection of intelligence on urban guerrillas. It called for rapid US troop reductions. The officers argued that Iraq would fall back into instability.</p>
<p>Obama stuck to his guns, and the US soldiers stopped patrolling the cities independently on June 30, 2009. In July of that year, the number of attacks by guerrillas and the number of civilians killed both fell by one third. It appears that the patrols were causing violence, not stopping it, since the guerrillas attacked the patrols and ended up killing civilians.</p>
<p>The troop withdrawal also proceeded apace throughout the past year. Although Iraq remains in a low-intensity civil war, the monthly death toll of civilians and security forces averages 300-400 now, compared to 2500 a month in summer of 2006. At the height of the troop escalation or surge there were around 170,000 US troops in Iraq. Today there are about 88,000 and the number is rapidly falling.</p>
<p>Everything the naysayers in the Pentagon alleged about the effect of implementing the SOFA was wrong.</p>
<p>Now unnamed sources in Iraq <a href="http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/fighting-but-not-calling-it-combat/" type="external">are leaking again to the New York Times</a>. They want to insist that the timetable for troop withdrawal in the SOFA is unrealistic. They cannot imagine that US troops will really leave by the end of 2011. They are sure that the SOFA will be renegotiated by the new Iraqi government whenever it is finally formed.</p>
<p>While the SOFA could be tinkered with, there are powerful forces working against that outcome. The Sadrists, fundamentalist Shiites who follow cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, may well be kingmakers of the new government, and they are dead set against any change to the SOFA timetables. The Sadrists are highly politically networked and their relative success in the March 7 parliamentary elections attests to their political strength even today. They could prove spoilers of any attempt by the US to drag its feet on withdrawal, since they can put thousands of protesters and hundreds of guerrillas in the street.</p>
<p>Nor is the threat only of renewed political unrest among Sadrists if the US stays in force. Al-Hayat reported on May 24, ?The local government in Basra announced yesterday its commitment to the security agreement signed by Iraq and the United States for scheduling the US forces? withdrawal. The announcement came in reply to statements by Al-Sadr Trend in the governorate about preparing its armed wing ?Al-Mahdi Army? to resume the resistance activity against the remaining forces in the governorate and to wait for orders to do this from Trend Leader Muqtada al-Sadr.?</p>
<p>It is true that the 50,000 or so troops that will be left in Iraq as of September may not all be ?non-combat? units, since there will be some rebranding. And it is true that Iraq will need the US air force for years to come, for logistics purposes. But to say that the timetable will be tinkered with at the request of the Iraqi parliament in any major way is wishful thinking.</p>
<p>The US commanders were expecting to be asked by the Iraqi officers to go on joint patrols in the major cities. They got few invitations, even though they had trained many of the Iraqi officers who now gave them the cold shoulder. The new Iraqi military is perfectly capable of patrolling on its own now in cities such as Baghdad, and of facing down any ordinary threat from militias. The US is not needed for routine security patrols. While the Iraqi troops have not been able to establish order in Mosul or in Diyala Province, the prospect of the dwindling number of US troops doing so is slim to none. Iraq is just going to be a little unstable for a few years, and even if US troops stayed in numbers past the deadlines, it is highly unlikely that they could miraculously lend the place stability. Bush knocked Iraq off balance, and it will likely remain off balance for a good long time. Bush was not authorized by the Iraqi people to destroy the country. He was acting more like his namesake, King George III, than like a president who won an election.</p>
<p>Moreover, as the US military has increasingly focused on Afghanistan, many will realize that they just don?t have the resources to continue in Iraq.</p>
<p>Iraqi factions are finding it hard to form a government in the wake of the March 7 parliamentary elections. But they have a perfectly good interim government, that of incumbent Nuri al-Maliki, in the meantime. And it took Lebanon 5 months to form a government recently. The Lebanon case is instructive because the national unity government that came out of months of wrangling is fairly representative and seems to have forestalled further trouble of the sort we saw in May 2008. Vice President <a href="" type="external">Biden may or may not succeed in helping the factions make progress during his visit to Baghdad this weekend</a>, but contrary to what some American politicians say, there is no reason the process of government-formation cannot be protracted. Consensus is better in Iraqi politics than up-and-down-votes that cause some faction to lose and to lose face.</p>
<p>For the pragmatic reason that the US cannot afford Iraq, and because it is the right thing to do, the Obama administration should withdraw in a systematic and deliberate manner from Iraq. We owe its people their independence. It is what we used, at least, to stand for.</p></article>
<article id="0000286" published-at="2014-03-11" title="Obama Creates New National Monument"><p>On Tuesday, President Obama held a ceremony at the White House to announce his use of executive authority to expand the <a href="http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/content/ca/en/prog/blm_special_areas/nm/ccnm.html" type="external">California Coastal National Monument</a> (CCNM) to include the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands on the Mendocino Coast. This is the first land-based addition to the CCNM and permanently protects more than 1,660 acres of beach, bluffs, and the Garcia River estuary. The area is home to rare and endangered species such as coho salmon, steelhead, the Point Arena mountain beaver, and the Behren?s silverspot butterfly. The Mendocino Coast of California was recently picked for the number 3 spot in the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/01/10/travel/2014-places-to-go.html" type="external">?52 Places to Go in 2014.?</a>&amp;#160;This is the 10th national monument designated by President Obama. For comparison, President Clinton created 19 new monuments and enlarged three others, while President George W. Bush used his power under the Antiquities Act just 5 times.</p>
<p>While Obama has been criticized in the past for his reluctance to declare monuments, there appears to be new momentum in the administration to conserve. Former Interior Secretary Ken Salazar <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/03/25/president-obama-designates-five-new-national-monuments" type="external">announced five designations</a> before leaving office last year, and in November, his successor Sally Jewell delivered a major agenda-setting speech on conservation that challenged Congress to pass the many backlogged conservation bills that are pending, saying that ?President Obama is ready and willing to step up where Congress falls short.?</p>
<p>Obama confirmed this in his state of the Union speech, saying????I?ll use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations.?</p>
<p>Even Congress seems to be hearing the message. Although the previous 112th Congress became somewhat notorious as the first in decades not to protect a single new acre of public lands, last Tuesday, Congress passed a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/congress-passes-bill-to-protect-michigans-sleeping-bear-dunes-as-wilderness-area/2014/03/04/89c0dc34-a3ee-11e3-a5fa-55f0c77bf39c_story.html" type="external">bill to set aside</a> more than 30,000 acres of wilderness at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in Michigan.</p>
<p>?The President?s decision to protect this stunning section of California?s coastline shows his commitment to helping communities protect the lands and waters they love,? said Matt Lee-Ashley, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. ?It also sends a clear signal to Congress that???as the President has already made clear???he is not going to continue to wait while dozens of parks and wilderness bills remain stalled, year after year.?</p>
<p>?The President is right to use his authority to ensure that America?s most special places are protected for everyone to experience and enjoy.?</p>
<p>Despite the new momentum to conserve, Obama still has a long way to go to establish balance between conservation and fossil fuel development on federal lands. From the beginning of Obama?s first term through 2013, 7.3 million acres of public lands were leased to oil and gas companies, while just 2.9 million acres were permanently protected.</p>
<p>The newly-designated area has long been considered for special protection. In July, the House <a href="http://huffman.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/huffman-introduces-first-bill-as-us-congressman" type="external">unanimously approved</a> Rep. Jared Huffman?s (D-CA) proposal to add the area to the California Coastal National Monument, but subsequently the bill was left to languish in the Senate.</p>
<p>?I am thrilled that President Obama has preserved these pristine and breathtaking coastal lands,? said Congressman Huffman. ?Thousands of new visitors each year will flock to see this gateway to the Coastal National Monument. As they enjoy some of the best ocean views in Northern California, they will also provide a significant boost to the local tourism industry, already Mendocino County?s biggest employer. I thank President Obama for bringing this land into permanent protection as a National Monument.?</p>
<p>?This is great news for small businesses, because entrepreneurs know protecting our natural assets is one way we can enhance the financial success of small businesses and local economies.? said John Arensmeyer, Founder and CEO of Small Business Majority. ?Small business owners in the West strongly believe the designation of additional national parks and monuments enhances local jobs and the economy.?</p>
<p>The Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks in New Mexico, the Boulder-White Clouds in Idaho and the Greater Canyonlands in Utah are on the top of conservationists? wish lists for future monument designation.</p>
<p>In response to the president?s action Rep. Rob Bishop released the following statement. ?The legislation was held up in the Senate so the president could usurp the congressional process,? said Bishop. ?In other words, the House was punked by the president. Had the Senate done its job, the bill would have been considered and passed under regular order. There was broad support for the measure.?</p></article>
<article id="0000288" published-at="2015-01-17" title="Elon Musk looks to other companies, students to push Hyperloop forward"><p>Elon Musk is a man of many hats, with Tesla at the forefront of the electric car revolution and SpaceX in the midst of innovating space transportation. But not all of Musk?s ideas are feasible and some are in the wishful realm rather than reality. One of them is the high-speed transportation system Hyperloop, a $6 billion concept calling for pods to shuttle people between U.S. cities.</p>
<p>Instead of quietly putting the idea away, Musk this week affirmed his commitment by going on Twitter ? his preferred platform to make announcements ? to share that he was exploring building a Hyperloop test track ?for companies and student teams to test out their pods,? <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2475312,00.asp" type="external">PC Mag</a> reported, adding the track will likely be at an unspecified location in Texas.</p>
<p>In another tweet, Musk mused he was ?also thinking of having an annual student Hyperloop pod racer competition, like Formula SAE.?</p>
<p>Originally introduced by Musk in August 2013 as an alternative to California?s maligned high-speed rail system, Hyperloop would function by transporting people in low-pressure tubes with capsules ? or ?pods? ? with up to 28 passengers each. The pods would move at low and high speeds through the tube on air cushion provided through pressurized air and aerodynamic lift, <a href="http://carfanaticsblog.com/2013/08/12/elon-musk-releases-hyperloop-details/" type="external">Car Fanatics Blog</a> reported. Hyperloop could transport people and freight from Los Angeles to San Francisco in about half-hour and the trip would cost $20 if ridership reached 7.4 million people.</p>
<p>Parallel to Hyperloop, Musk is also focused on artificial intelligence, recently donating $10 million to the Future of Life Institute for a global AI research program, PC Mag reported. The donation is surprising considering Musk raised concerns about AI at an MIT conference.</p>

<p>U.S. futures were down and gold hit a fresh nominal high over fears that any deal on <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2011/07/24/live-blog-the-u-s-debt-battle/?mod=e2tw" type="external">U.S. debt reduction</a> will come too late for the United States to meet an Aug. 2 deadline to avoid defaulting on its debts, the Wall Street Journal said in a live blog of the day's market movements.</p>
<p>"With just days to go now before the Aug. 2 deadline, investors who had previously written the impasse off as political games are now going to seriously consider the possibility of a default," GFT <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110724-705138.html" type="external">Global Markets</a>director of global dealing operations Martin Slaney told Dow Jones Newswires.&amp;#160;</p>

<p>The Shanghai market was hardest hit, losing 2.16 percent with the additional impact of infrastructure concerns following a fatal <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/china/110723/bullet-train-crash-china-kills-11" type="external">high-speed train crash</a> on the weekend.</p>

<p>After weeks of agonizing talks, President Barack Obama has been unable to convince Republican leaders that a "grand bargain" on long-term deficit reduction must include <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/americas/united-states/110723/no-new-debt-deal-after-war-words-between-obama-a" type="external">tax increases on the rich</a> as well as spending cuts for the poor.</p>
<p>The Republican majority in the lower House have said they will not agree to raise the limit on the country's debt, now totaling $14.3 trillion, to allow the government to service its debts without a deal on the deficit.</p>
<p>Economists including Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke have warned of catastrophic consequences for the world economy, and U.S. credit worthiness, in the event the world's richest economy defaults.</p>
<p>The stalemate only hardened over the weekend when chief Republican negotiator John Boehner refused to return Obama's telephone calls.</p>
<p>Despite Monday's market turmoil, many analysts still believe neither side will allow a default.</p>
<p>Dariusz Kowalczyk, a senior economist and strategist at <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gNJOT7xyzUluCQUQboVzndlGq33g?docId=CNG.7b60b3003a7af7c33f4f5e84be2d4c22.471" type="external">Credit Agricole</a>CIB, told AFP: "With a week still to go, I think the general sentiment is that there could be many solutions.

<p>Twitter Ads: Chances are your business is already on Twitter engaging customers in some aspect, so adding a Twitter ads campaign can only help drive that engagement up and gain additional followers and sales. Twitter Ads allows extremely hyper-targeted ads, which can lead to a fantastic ROI.</p>
<p>Local Networks: Many businesses aren?t taking advantage of <a href="http://societyflorence.com/circle-the-local-network-is-this-new-app-worth-the-time/" type="external">&amp;#160;local networks such as Circle Opens a New Window.</a>&amp;#160;to facilitate discussion and gain more customers. While this might not be applicable to a national brand, individual chains can participate in local networks to become more authoritative and act as a go-to resource for local information. Other local networks such as Meetey are an under-utilized tool that can be of big value.</p>
<p>2. Crowdsource a Custom Wiki</p>
<p>Crowdsourcing was all the rage in 2013, and in 2014 one can reasonably expect it to be even more relevant when it comes to social networks. Successfully utilizing crowdsourcing can be difficult because it requires an already high level of engagement, but if done correctly it can pay dividends for both businesses and customers alike. Crowdsourcing a custom wiki is essentially asking your past customers to develop content for you to help other customers. It could be anything from testimonials to FAQs to common issues; whatever it is, the content is coming from the customers, meaning it?s honest. It will also help you as a business get valuable feedback in order to improve and offer better services.</p>
<p>3. Engage Your 21st&amp;#160;Century Coupon&amp;#160;Young Professionals</p>
<p>One of the main demographic users for social networks, they would never clip a coupon out of a magazine and bring it to your establishment. Businesses are using social media to create customized, unique ?eDeals? to engage and draw in customers. Whether it?s&amp;#160; <a href="http://storify.com/miguelsalcido/is-apple-s-ibeacon-the-wave-of-the-future/" type="external">harnessing the power of the iBeacon Opens a New Window.</a>&amp;#160;to create GPS targeted deals or offering dedicated customer service agents via Twitter to respond to issues and offer customer retention deals, the 21st&amp;#160;century coupon is a game changer. Each social network offers a somewhat different opportunity relating to how a business could offer a coupon. For example, ?checking-in? on Facebook or FourSquare could unlock a deal, or tweeting that you?re at a current location could do the same. The more creative a business is with its social coupons, the higher the likelihood of engagement.</p>

<article id="0000292" published-at="2012-11-09" title="Lies and liars lost"><p>My cynicism about the stupidity of the American public would have increased exponentially if Mitt Romney would have been elected president. In over 50 years of voting and 25 years of working professionally in the world of politics and public policy, I had never seen such outrageous and persistent lies, distortions and intellectual insults from a presidential candidate. Please note that I was not an Obama supporter; I proudly voted for the Libertarian candidate.</p>
<p>Repeatedly, Romney sold his soul to first get the Republican nomination and then attempt to win the presidency. For such a supposedly religious person he had no difficulty in saying anything to win support, despite contradictions with his previous positions and statements as well as with objective facts. The only thing you could trust about him was his love for his family and religion, and oh yes his quite negative view of 47 percent of the American public muttered when he thought he was only talking to a bunch of his rich supporters. But for such callous behavior he deserves to go to Mormon hell for lying to so many, including himself apparently because he could justify just about anything because the end of becoming president justified all means.</p>
<p>Up until the last moment so many of his supporters and the mental midget blowhards on right-wing talk radio let their own delusional thinking prevent them from seeing reality. On FOX News, the usual idiots kept predicting landslide state victories for Romney even after all major networks had declared reelection of President Obama, including the FOX network. Not so surprising when one appreciates the anti-science views of so many conservatives. Remarkably, the supposed data driven and smart Romney bought into the delusional, self-serving predictions from his supporters in the final days and hours.</p>
<p>?Impossible to beat Santa Claus,? said the poisonous pundit Rush Limbaugh as his explanation of why Romney lost, very much in line with the 47 percent belief of Romney. Rush only sees lies on the left and none of the multitude of lies that came from the Romney campaign. And he easily ignores the over 65 demographic taking Medicare and Social Security benefits who mostly voted for Romney. True conservatives should stop listening to the herd of right-wing radio nuts.</p>
<p>Here is my recommendation to President Obama: Offer Mitt Romney the new cabinet position of Secretary of Business. What a show of innovative bipartisan thinking. And Romney should gladly accept the offer if he has any core belief whatsoever of serving his country.</p>
<p>The two-party plutocracy remains alive and very well. Third party presidential candidates once again did miserably. Most congressional incumbents were reelected, as usual. The American delusional democracy marches on.</p>
<p>Billions of dollars wasted propagating lies from both sides designed to piss off or frighten people. Happy to see all those millionaires and billionaires wasting their money on the Romney campaign. Now, every one of them should donate equal amounts to the recovery efforts related to the Sandy Hurricane disaster.</p>

<article id="0000293" published-at="2015-05-30" title="Screech on Trial: ?Saved By the Bell? Actor Dustin Diamond Convicted in Stabbing"><p>TV actor Dustin Diamond was convicted Friday of two misdemeanors stemming from a barroom fight, but a Wisconsin jury cleared the former "Saved by the Bell" actor of the most serious felony charge.</p>
<p>The jury's verdict came just hours after the 38-year-old actor testified that he never intended to stab anyone in the fight last Christmas Day. He had pleaded not guilty to a felony charge of recklessly endangering public safety, plus two misdemeanors ? carrying a concealed weapon and disorderly conduct.</p>
<p>The first misdemeanor carries a maximum sentence of nine months in prison, the second a maximum of 90 days in prison.</p>
<p>Diamond didn't display emotion at the jury's decision Friday night. He told reporters he couldn't comment as he left the courtroom after a 13-hour day of testimony and jury deliberations.</p>
<p>Diamond, who played the character Screech on the popular 1990s show, said some people had wanted to shake his hand and pose for photos at the bar, but that others were badgering him and his girlfriend, Amanda Schutz. He said he was trying to scare bar patrons in Port Washington after his girlfriend was punched in the face.</p>
<p>"I felt like we were being set up for antagonistic purposes," he said.</p>
<p>Witnesses testified that Schutz pushed one woman at the bar and grabbed another woman's hand, initiating the incident. Schutz also faces a misdemeanor disorderly conduct charge.</p>
<p>Diamond said he tried to help Schutz and took out his pocketknife to deter the group from hurting her more.</p>
<p>The man who was stabbed, 25-year-old Casey Smet, testified Thursday that he didn't know he had been stabbed until he had left the bar and was talking to police.</p>
<p>After maintaining a serious facade during most of the trial, Diamond grinned Friday when a defense attorney asked if he liked being compared to the character Screech. Diamond said he liked being identified in public as the goofy television character.</p>
<p>"That means they love you," Diamond said. "That means you're doing your job."</p>
<p>Ozaukee County District Attorney Adam Gerol argued Friday that Diamond lied about what happened and that the actor had scripted his testimony.</p>
<p>Gerol showed body-camera footage of Diamond's testimony to a Port Washington police officer the night of the fight. In the video Diamond first said he might have struck Smet with a pen. In a video of testimony later that night, Diamond said he had a knife at the bar, but hadn't used it to stab anyone.</p>
<p>The jury also convicted Schutz with disorderly conduct Friday night. Schutz faces a maximum of 90 days in prison.</p>
<p>A sentencing date for Diamond and Schutz has not been announced.</p></article>
<article id="0000294" published-at="2017-09-11" title="Global insurance capital rule snared in transatlantic divide"><p>By Huw Jones</p>
<p>LONDON (Reuters) ? The first global standard for investors to compare how much capital insurers from different countries hold to keep policies safe is caught in a transatlantic tussle, casting doubt on whether it is practical, industry and regulatory officials say.</p>
<p>Global banks have used common ?Basel? capital rules for decades, and the $180 billion bailout for insurer AIG (N:) during the 2007-09 financial crisis prompted regulators to embark on a similar standard for insurers in 2013 for the world?s top 50 insurers.</p>
<p>But four years into the work there is no completed International Capital Standard (ICS) nor a firm date for its introduction, making it harder for investors and policyholders to compare insurers from different parts of the world.</p>
<p>?The sense is there has been a collective pause around the ICS following elections in the United States and the European Union, as well as Brexit,? said Mike Consedine, chief executive of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which groups U.S. state-level regulators.</p>
<p>Slow progress has triggered speculation within the industry that regulators may tell insurers the process is now on hold when they meet in Kuala Lumpur in November.</p>
<p>Hugh Savill, director of regulation at the Association of British Insurers, a trade body, said the ICS lacked sufficient political support for now to drive it through to completion.</p>
<p>?There is a serious stalemate, and I see us no nearer agreement than two years ago,? Savill said.</p>
<p>Others were openly critical.</p>
<p>?It?s a mess. The U.S. won?t play and the ICS is going nowhere,? said the chief executive of a European insurer.</p>
<p>?I don?t think you will get a material change in global capital because nobody can afford it.?</p>
<p>Few believe, however, that a new capital rule would lead to big hikes in requirements.</p>
<p>The ICS is being written by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) whose chair, Victoria Saporta, a Bank of England executive director, said a significant step forward was taken in July when the first version of the ICS was published for field testing.</p>
<p>?There is no question that arriving at an ICS that achieves greater convergence than that of the different group capital standards adopted in different jurisdictions and regions is a challenging task,? Saporta told Reuters.</p>
<p>?But it is also a necessary one if policyholders of international groups are to be better protected, whilst also enjoying the more inclusive offering that can result from the greater capital efficiencies of international diversification.?</p>
<p>CARRY ON TALKING</p>
<p>The IAIS has yet to come up with a single approach to calculating the amount of capital the world?s top 50 or so insurers will have to hold.</p>
<p>It is testing two ?approaches? for valuing liabilities such as future payouts on policies.</p>
<p>The first approach is based on U.S. accounting rules, while the second is based on market prices, similar to EU capital rules known as Solvency II.</p>
<p>But without as yet unclarified adjustments, the two approaches would come up with different capital requirements and leave investors scratching their heads.</p>
<p>?Is there a bridge between U.S. accounting and Europe?s Solvency II? There is none that is economically sound,? said Tobias Buecheler, head of regulatory strategy at German insurer Allianz (DE:).</p>
<p>?It?s unclear how those approaches can be combined, aligned. You have a divide between the United States and Europe.?</p>
<p>Insurance industry officials say the IAIS should instead focus on managing risks from the sector?s activities, seen as more fruitful regulatory territory.</p>
<p>Insurers point out that AIG was the only insurer bailed out in the financial crisis, and this was because it had moved into non-core, riskier hedge fund activities.</p>
<p>Cristina Mihai, head of international affairs at Insurance Europe, a trade body, said it would be hard to have an ICS based on just one approach.</p>
<p>Finding a common approach is becoming more difficult.</p>
<p>NAIC announced a few weeks ago it was teaming up with the Federal Reserve to write a new U.S. capital rule, and Consedine made clear that any global rule would have to fit in with what this double act comes up with, not the other way round.</p>
<p>?We have stressed the need previously for the ICS to be principles-based and to give countries a certain level of jurisdictional flexibility. That?s going to be critical for the United States,? Consedine said.</p>
<p>Complications loom in Europe, too.</p>
<p>European insurers will begin using a new accounting rule in 2021 known as IFRS 17, representing a major overhaul of how income is calculated. The EU?s Solvency II rules will be reviewed, meaning there could be changes with knock-on effects for the ICS.</p>
<p>?There are more goalposts and they are all moving, that is the problem,? Allianz?s Buecheler said.</p>
<p>Consedine said NAIC remains committed to the goals of the ICS, but it must result in something that is ?workable for the United States and for regulators?.</p></article>

<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has delayed imposing additional sanctions on Russia and is unlikely to approve them unless Moscow carries out a new cyber attack or some other provocation, a senior administration official said on Monday.</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Sunday that Washington was preparing new sanctions on Russia over its support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.</p>
<p>?The ambassador got out ahead of things this time,? the senior administration official, who deals with the issue, told Reuters on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>The Washington Post first reported that Trump had put a stop to a plan for additional economic sanctions on Russia.</p> Related Coverage

<p>The official said Trump was concerned that immediately imposing more sanctions, on the heels of last weekend?s U.S.-led strike against Russian-backed Assad, would interfere with his efforts to negotiate agreements with Russian President Vladimir Putin on combating Islamic extremism, policing the internet and other issues.</p>
<p>The United States has taken a series of recent measures against Russia, including expelling diplomats over a poisoning case in Britain and imposing sanctions against 24 Russians, including Putin allies, over interference in the U.S. presidential election and other ?malign activity.? Moscow has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>On Monday, the administration accused Russian government-backed hackers of a global cyber attack on routers and other networking equipment.</p>
<p>The official said Trump had expressed concern that if the administration did not proceed cautiously, tensions between Washington and Moscow - already at their worst since the Cold War - could escalate dangerously, the official said.</p>
<p>Asked for comment, the White House gave an identical response to an earlier statement by Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, who said: ?We are considering additional sanctions on Russia and a decision will be made in the near future.?</p> HOLDING OFF ?A LITTLE WHILE?
<p>Another senior administration official said Haley had gotten a little bit ahead of herself by saying more sanctions were coming, but not by much.</p>
<p>?They were discussed but it was decided to hold off for a little while,? that official said.</p>
<p>Haley?s office declined to comment.</p>
<p>Trump still believes he can negotiate with Putin, but that it is not likely to be productive if he is also criticizing him repeatedly, the first official said.</p> U.S. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders holds the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, DC, U.S. April 13, 2018.

<p>Trump criticized Putin after the suspected gas attack in Syria for backing ?Animal Assad,? but he has not done so again.</p>
<p>Washington has said it had proof that Syrian forces conducted the deadly chemical weapons attack on April 7.</p>
<p>If the U.S. sanctions were enacted, they would be the second such batch in just over a year against Syria?s weapons of mass destruction program.</p>

<p>LONDON (Reuters) - ?Who?s next?? investors in Russia are asking as they scramble to clear their portfolios of ?oligarch risk? - holdings in companies that may be next in line for U.S. sanctions after metals company Rusal was targeted last week.</p> FILE PHOTO: A view shows a tower of the Kremlin (R) and the Foreign Ministry headquarters (back) in Moscow, Russia March 16, 2018. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/File Photo
<p>The threat of more sanctions had already made investors wary of Russian companies, seen as more vulnerable to U.S. action than the sovereign. Their fears proved justified when on April 6, the U.S. Treasury slapped sanctions on a range of Russian companies and ?oligarchs? ? businessmen deemed to be close to the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Aluminum company Rusal, controlled by Oleg Deripaska, has been one of the main targets. Rusal itself has warned that the impact of sanctions could trigger technical default on some of its debts.</p>
<p>Earlier sanctions on major Russian companies were so-called sectoral sanctions which limit U.S. investor participation in debt-raising for sanctioned firms. The sanctions imposed on Rusal this month go further, barring U.S. investors from having any dealings with the sanctioned entities.</p>
<p>Russia?s sovereign debt and assets of other Russian companies are not yet sanctioned but that might change. Washington is looking at new sanctions aimed at Russian companies allegedly dealing with equipment related to chemical weapons in Syria.</p>
<p>?The question investors have is: who is next? Could you extend Rusal-style sanctions to other companies? Potentially they could,? said Greg Saichin, chief investment officer for emerging market debt at Allianz Global Investors.</p>
<p>?We know of a number of individuals who are either owners of companies or have stakes in companies, who may be next in line ... There is oligarch risk so we have moved to reduce the Kremlin element in the portfolio,? he added.</p> Related Coverage
<a href="/article/us-usa-russia-sanctions-kudlow/trump-adviser-denies-confusion-over-russia-sanctions-idUSKBN1HO2PI" type="external">Trump adviser denies confusion over Russia sanctions</a>
<p>A list of 210 wealthy Russians named by the U.S. Treasury in January is widely seen as the place to look for clues. It contained 96 oligarchs, including Vladimir Potanin, co-owner of Norilsk Nickel, metals magnates Alisher Usmanov and Alexei Mordashov and CEOs of two big state-run banks.</p>
<p>John Bates, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments, said he had reduced exposure to companies with high ?oligarch risk?, noting that if sanctions were expanded ?we could be in another quite severe leg down in terms of valuations.?</p>
<p>The latest U.S. sanctions have caused pain across Russian markets, which were riding high with investors prior to last week?s sell off. Investors? Russian bond holdings as of end-March would have been around $46 billion, assuming their allocation to Russia was the same as its share in various global bond indexes, data from State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) shows.</p> CALCULATED RISKS
<p>Last week, as the rouble dropped 6 percent, equities fell 4.6 percent and Russian corporate dollar bond yields surged by an average 100 basis points, those portfolios would have suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Ratings agency Fitch said the sell-off reflected fears the sanctions list would be extended, possibly to companies that transact with the already designated entities and individuals.</p>
<p>As a result, investors are not ready yet to pick over the wreckage for bargains.</p>
<p>Even before the meltdown, asset managers had been screening Russian companies to avoid exposure to those already subject to sanctions imposed after Russia?s annexation of Ukraine?s Crimea region in 2014.</p>
<p>Ironically though, those sanctions made companies? debt more attractive to some investors. A volatile rouble, government pressure to cut external debt and higher barriers to raising debt on international markets steadily reduced their outstanding debt levels.</p>
<p>Russian companies, excluding banks, have about $270 billion in hard currency debt according to TD Securities, and just $13 billion falls due in 2018. Servicing that will not be a problem ? unless they are hit with sanctions too.</p>
<p>Fund managers would have to take a ?calculated risk? on which Russian names to sell, Saichin of Allianz said.</p>
<p>?If no sanction has been imposed you basically have to sit on it,? he said, noting there were few buyers for the bonds anyway.</p>
<p>Money managers in general see low sanctions risk for Russian sovereign debt and securities of state-run flagship companies such as Gazprom, which supplies a major part of Europe?s energy, or Sberbank, Russia?s biggest bank.</p>
<p>Others such as Lukoil or Phosagro, which have kept themselves at arms? length from the Kremlin, are also considered a safer bet.</p>
<p>Markets reflect that view ? the bonds of steelmaker Severstal, around 80 percent owned by Alexei Mordashov, were the biggest fallers last week from a list of mining and energy firms, after Rusal and Polyus Gold, Abhishek Kumar, lead investment manager for emerging markets fixed income beta at SSGA, noted.</p>
<p>Polyus is controlled by the family of Suleiman Kerimov who is on the sanctioned individuals list.</p>
<p>Bonds in Evraz, Norilsk Nickel, Metalloinvest and steel pipe maker TMK also fell an average 3-5 cents last week, while Lukoil and state firm Rosneftegaz fell the least.</p>
<p>?Clearly, the sentiments are against any companies dealing in commodities,? Kumar said.</p>
<p>Steelmaker NLMK is controlled by Vladimir Lisin while TMK is majority-owned by Dmitry Pumpyansky. Neither man is on the list of sanctioned individuals.</p>
<p>As for Russia?s sovereign debt, most investors are sitting tight, believing Washington will not bar investors from it, even if the U.S. Congress is trying to build support for such a step.</p>
<p>Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers said the ?mindset? was not to ditch Russian government debt even if the latest sanctions had raised fears the sovereign might be hit.</p>
<p>?We think that would be highly unlikely. It would be like an act of war,? he said.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump?s Twitter post on currencies in China and Russia was a warning to those countries against devaluing their currencies, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Tuesday in an interview with CNBC.</p> Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin testifies before the House Committee on Appropriations on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 11, 2018.

<p>Trump accused Russia and China on Monday of devaluing their currencies while the United States raises interest rates, prompting China to accuse the United States of sending confusing messages.</p>
<p>?It was a warning shot at China and Russia about devaluation. China has devalued their currency in the past,? Mnuchin said. ?He?s watching it.?</p>
<p>He said the Twitter post was not related to Trump?s view on the strength of the dollar.</p>
<p>Trump said on Twitter on Monday: ?Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the U.S. keeps raising interest rates. Not acceptable!?</p>
<p>The tweet referred to what Trump sees as unfair trading advantages: If a country?s currency is artificially low, its exports are more competitive. Higher U.S. interest rates would generally increase the value of the dollar, making U.S. exports more expensive.</p>

<p>Since Trump took office in January 2017, the dollar has weakened substantially against most currencies, including the Chinese yuan and, until the United States imposed sanctions on Russia in the last few weeks, the ruble.</p>
<p>Against the yuan, the dollar has fallen by 8.6 percent since Jan. 20, 2017, while it has appreciated 4.5 percent against the ruble.</p>
<p>Until the United States announced sanctions on Russian oligarchs this month, however, the dollar had weakened by nearly 4 percent against the Russian currency.</p>
<p>That gain was entirely erased by a two-day drop of 8.4 percent in the ruble on April 9 and 10.</p>
<p>More widely, the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback?s value against a basket of major trading partner currencies, has declined by 11.2 percent since Trump became president.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury, in a semiannual report on Friday, again refrained from naming any major trading partners as currency manipulators. The report came as the Trump administration pursues potential tariffs, negotiations and other restrictions to try to cut a massive trade deficit with China.</p>

<article id="0000298" published-at="2017-02-09" title="Here's Why SM Energy Co's Stock Plunged 11% in January"><p></p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>Shares of SM Energy (NYSE: SM) stumbled into 2017, slumping 11% during the first month. While the company had some good news, investors focused more on what the company did not say.</p>
<p>SM Energy actually got the year started off on the right foot, announcing in early January that it had sold its non-operated Eagle Ford shale assets to a unit of private equity firm KKR (NYSE: KKR) for $800 million. That sale will give SM Energy additional flexibility to aggressively grow its Midland Basin assets over the next few years.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Analysts loved the deal, with both Bank of America/Merrill and Baird releasing bullish commentary shortly after its announcement. BofA, for example, initiated the stock at Buy with a $52 price target citing the company's notable transition after selling $2 billion of assets since 2013 to focus on the Midland Basin. Meanwhile, Baird said the stock was underappreciated and reiterated its buy rating and $49 price target. The analyst thought that the company should benefit from rising oil prices due to its focus on the low-cost Midland Basin.</p>
<p>About a week later SM Energy announced that it had put the rest of its Bakken shale assets up for sale by launching a formal bid process for its Divide County assets. The company hopes to close a transaction by mid-year. That announcement follows an earlier divestiture of Bakken assets to Oasis Petroleum (NYSE: OAS). SM Energy used the proceeds from the Oasis Petroleum transaction to help finance an acquisition in the Midland Basin.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the month, SM Energy received another vote of confidence from analysts after KeyBanc said investors should buy shares before its month-end conference call. The analyst thought that the call would prove to be a catalyst for the stock because it would feature an update on its Midland Basin well results. Unfortunately, that call did not turn out to be a catalyst. Instead, <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/01/31/why-sm-energy-cos-stock-is-stumbling-today.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness" type="external">shares plunged Opens a New Window.</a> because the company said it would invest capital in testing its acreage instead of ramping up to full development mode. That suggests production growth could come in below what investors were hoping.</p>
<p>SM Energy is still in the early stages of a transition from a diversified shale producer to a company entirely focused on the red-hot Midland Basin. This development is taking longer than investors had hoped. However, that is because SM Energy wants to make sure it gets things right by fully optimizing its acreage in the Midland. That strategy could prove to be a winner over the long term.</p>

<p>Stocks cut losses in afternoon trading, led by a rise in tech shares. The S&amp;amp;P 500 technology index ended up 0.1 percent, helped by gains in Apple, up 1.7 percent at $127.04, and Facebook, up 1.7 percent at $79.36.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>After the bell, shares of Oracle rose 3.4 percent to $44.33 following results.</p>
<p>Investors were anxious as the Federal Open Market Committee kicked off a two-day policy meeting, to be followed by a statement from Fed Chair Janet Yellen Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Most economists expect the Fed to remove a pledge to be "patient" about raising interest rates from its statement. Market strategists said with or without a change in the language, the Fed may still be on track to raise rates as early as June.</p>
<p>"People are waiting for the Fed to provide some degree of clarity," said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.</p>
<p>Among S&amp;amp;P 500 sectors, materials was the weakest with a 1.2 percent decline, led by DuPont, down 3.1 percent at $74.68.</p>

<p>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 128.34 points, or 0.71 percent, to 17,849.08, the S&amp;amp;P 500 lost 6.91 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,074.28 and the Nasdaq Composite added 7.93 points, or 0.16 percent, to 4,937.44.</p>
<p>In addition to anxiety about the Fed statement, options expiration on Friday may have contributed to the day's volatility, said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist, Bolton Global Asset Management in Boston.</p>
<p>While higher rates would be a sign of strength in the U.S. economy, some investors question whether the economy is strong enough to handle increased borrowing costs.</p>
<p>The S&amp;amp;P 500's pullback followed its biggest percentage gain since Feb. 3 on Monday.</p>
<p>Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson weighed most heavily on the S&amp;amp;P 500 with a 1.2 percent decline to $99.89.</p>
<p>Also boosting the Nasdaq, shares in American Airlines jumped 6.9 percent to $53.69 after an announcement that it would join the S&amp;amp;P 500.</p>
<p>About 6.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.6 billion average for the month to date, according to BATS Global Markets.</p>
<p>Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,607 to 1,429, for a 1.12-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,384 issues rose and 1,330 fell, for a 1.04-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.</p>
<p>The S&amp;amp;P 500 posted 26 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 112 new highs and 62 new lows.</p>

<article id="0000312" published-at="2014-04-18" title="Lap Dancers, the CIA, Payoffs and BP?s Deepwater Horizon"><p></p>
<p>?There was CIA involvement through a company called Mega Oil. They were shipping in arms under the cover of oil tools.?</p>
<p>The BP executive was explaining to me how the CIA, MI6 and British Petroleum engineered a coup d??tat, overthrowing a nation?s elected president who was ?not favorable to BP.? The corporation?s former vice president, Leslie Abrahams, is pictured above, holding an AK-47 in front of BP?s offices in Baku, Azerbaijan. Like most of the other BP executives I spoke with, he proudly added that although he was working for BP, he was also an operative for MI6, British intelligence.</p>
<p>This conversation, which took place in 2010, was far from the weirdest I had in my four-continent investigation of the real story of the Deepwater Horizon.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The BP oil rig blew out on April 20 of that year, four years ago this Sunday.</p>
<p>Last month, the Obama administration officially OK?d BP?s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/20/bp-gulf-of-mexico-leases_n_4996314.html" type="external">right to resume</a> drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. A few days after lifting the ban, just to assure the company that all is forgiven, the U.S. Department of the Interior gave BP a new contract to drill in the Gulf of Mexico ? right next to where the Deepwater Horizon went down. At the same time, the forgive-and-forget U.S. Justice Department has put the trial of David Rainey, the only BP big shot charged with a felony crime in the disaster, on indefinite hold.</p>
<p>The Deepwater Horizon blowout incinerated 11 men on the rig and poisoned 600 miles of Gulf coastline. What political fairy dust does BP keep in its pocket to receive virtual immunity from the consequences?</p>
<p>To understand what really happened in the Gulf of Mexico, and how BP became a corporate creature beyond the reach of the law, British television network Channel 4 sent me on an investigation through a labyrinthine fun house of bribery, lap dancing, beatings, WikiLeaks, a coup d??tat, arrests and oil-state terror.</p>
<p>I found the cause of the tragedy of the Deepwater Horizon 7,000 miles from the Gulf in the ancient city of Baku, the Central Asian caravan stop on the Silk Road.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the interview with agent Abrahams and the full story of the Deepwater Horizon, see, ?Vultures and Vote Rustlers,? the documentary that will be available as a <a href="http://www.gregpalast.com/vulturesandvoterustlersfreedownload/" type="external">download without charge</a> until April 21 courtesy of the not-for-profit Palast Investigative Fund.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The literal source of Soviet power until 1991, Baku has been exporting petroleum for 3,000 years. As the Soviet Union shattered into pieces that year, BP set its sights on the city. It is now the capital of the new nation of Azerbaijan, which sits atop the biggest untapped oil field in the world, right beneath the Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>A coup for BP</p>
<p>In 1992, then-BP Chairman Lord Browne flew into Baku as soon as the young state elected its first president, Abulfaz Elchibey. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher joined him via the ?Iron Lady,? a plane the corporation outfitted especially for her. At a state dinner, Browne handed Abrahams, a BP vice president at the time, a briefcase and showed him the contents: a check for $30 million. Browne then gave the check to the president of Azerbaijan.</p>
<p>Still, the new president remained ?not favorable? to BP?s demand for control of the Caspian oil, so MI6, the CIA and the corporation went into action. The spy agencies armed and empowered former Soviet KGB chief Heydar Aliyev, who in 1993 overthrew Azerbaijan?s elected government. Once he became dictator, Aliyev named himself president for life and within four months signed a no-bid deal to give the reserves to BP.</p>
<p>BP and MI6 man Abrahams was instructed, he told me, to ?smooth the way? for the deal by taking Azeri officials to London in Browne?s jet for weekends of lap dancing and other entertainment. By Abrahams? own estimation, he paid over $3 million in additional cash bribes to make certain BP would have no trouble.</p>
<p>I should note that Abrahams broke no law: Bribery by a British subject was legal then. BP executives did not deny the payoffs when I questioned them directly, and MI6 officers proudly confirmed the coup?s purpose of locking in the offshore deal for BP.</p>
<p>Quick-dry, quick-kill cement</p>
<p>What does this have to do with the blowout of the Deepwater Horizon?</p>
<p>This: It is now well established that the disaster occurred when the cement used to cap the well failed, allowing explosive methane gas to fill the rig and transform it into a sinking fireball.</p>
<p>But this was not BP?s first cement failure and explosion. Just 17 months earlier, BP?s Caspian Sea Transocean rig had suffered exactly the same fate.</p>
<p>The cause of the two blowouts was identical. In the Caspian as in the Gulf, BP laced its cement with nitrogen gas. The nitrogen bubbles sped up the drying of the mixture, saving BP half a million dollars a day on rig rental charges. But in offshore high-pressure zones, nitrogen-spiked cement can fail. And it did. Twice.Question: Why in the world was BP allowed to use this insanely dangerous ?quick-dry? cement just after a failure in the Caspian? Answer: A cover-up ? via threats, beatings, arrests, bribery, perjury and the complicity of the U.S. State Department.</p>
<p>I learned of the prior blowout only because of a coded message from the Caspian Sea received from one very nervous eyewitness. To get the evidence, I flew to Baku and headed across the road-less desert to find more witnesses.</p>
<p></p>

<p>But we had been ratted out. My crew was placed under arrest by Azerbaijan?s secret police. Although officers demanded our film, I was allowed to keep my pen, which was actually a hidden camera. (I?ve learned a few things from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pArBEnKcoMw" type="external">Maxwell Smart</a>.)</p>
<p>How do you keep a monstrous blowout from going public? As one of the arresting cops told us with odd pride, ?BP drives this country.? It drives it with cash. Robert Ebel, former chief of oil analysis for the CIA, estimates that at least <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Energy-Conflict-Central-Asia-Caucasus/dp/0742500632" type="external">$140 million in payments</a> by BP for Azeri oil has gone unaccounted for. Where did it go? Notably, the Aliyev ruling family lives like pashas despite the president?s official salary of $100 a month.</p>
<p>Oil worker advocate Mirvari Gahramanli said she was beaten by police for raising questions. In case I doubted it, she showed me photographs of a dozen cops slamming her with long clubs.</p>
<p>What?s worse, while I was tossed out of the country (it would have looked bad to throw a TV reporter into a dungeon), my witnesses disappeared.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks and oily lies</p>
<p>Just five months before the Deepwater Horizon spill, Rainey ? BP?s vice president for Gulf exploration ? testified before the U.S. Congress that the company had drilled offshore ?for the last 50 years in a manner both safe and protective of the environment.?</p>
<p>BP?s testimony was a lie. The Caspian rig had blown out a year earlier.</p>
<p>But the lie was good enough for Congress. Based on Rainey?s assurances, legislators pressured the Department of the Interior to drop objections to plans for drilling in the Gulf?s deep waters.</p>
<p>Withholding information from Congress is a felony. But Rainey has one heck of a defense: The U.S. State Department was in on the cover-up.</p>
<p>Deep in the pile of confidential State Department cables released by one courageous U.S. soldier, Pfc. Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning, we have the notes from a secret meeting between the U.S. ambassador to Azerbaijan, Anne E. Derse, and the chief of BP?s Caspian operation.</p>
<p>The hugger-mugger was demanded by BP?s American partners, Chevron and Exxon. The U.S. oil companies had complained to the State Department that they were no longer getting their piece of the Caspian loot and BP wouldn?t tell them why. (You?ll remember that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was a member of Chevron?s board.)</p>
<p>In the memo, which you can see in our film ? <a href="http://www.palastinvestigativefund.org/?id=65" type="external">Vultures and Vote Rustlers</a>,? the U.S. ambassador provides the details of the blowout of the bad cement on the BP rig.</p>
<p>The State Department kept schtum (quiet) about it, not even warning U.S. safety regulators. And Exxon and Chevron?s chiefs joined BP?s Rainey in the mendacious sales pitch to Congress, testifying, despite their knowledge, that their offshore drilling methods were as safe as a game of checkers.</p>
<p>Justice is not always abused: Rainey was indicted on a felony charge of obstruction of Congress. However, the charge centers on a relatively minor falsehood: his alleged understatement of the amount of oil bursting into the Gulf. Neither Rainey nor BP will be tried for the deadlier lie to Congress ? the prior blowout caused by the penny-pinching quick-dry cement ? because the U.S. government is itself complicit in the cover-up.</p>
<p>Blowbacks and blowouts</p>
<p>And that?s why we are seeing the red carpet rolled out for BP in the Gulf once more.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Deepwater Horizon rig in flames. Photo by Palast Investigative Fund</p>
<p>When the U.S. government participates in the corruption of other democracies, when it authorizes bribery and ignores police-state tactics to benefit from business deals, the sins of empire can come back to haunt the nation. In the CIA?s world this is called ?blowback.? What was covered up in Baku has killed Americans in the Gulf, and it will likely continue to kill.</p>
<p>And bribery does not simply stay ?over there.? American officials are not as different from the Baku bandits as they may like to believe. The agency in charge of regulating BP?s drilling in the Gulf, the U.S. Minerals Management Service, was rife with watchdogs who, like their Azeri counterparts, took backhanders and payouts from BP. And when I say BP was in bed with the regulators, that is not a metaphor: A BP lobbyist was reportedly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/washington/11royalty.html" type="external">sleeping with</a> a chief of the agency.Don?t bother sending Rainey a file in a cake: The BP man won?t get two minutes of jail time. His trial has been suspended indefinitely.</p>
<p>Immunity from law is not new to BP. As I <a href="" type="internal">reported</a> last month, BP was the main culprit in the disaster caused by the Exxon Valdez grounding. The company walked away without paying a dime to the victims. In the case of the Deepwater Horizon, a few tenacious attorneys have ensured the corporation pays some compensation in the Gulf. But that money comes nowhere close to the damage it caused and will do nothing to harm the company?s bottom line.</p>
<p>The oil is still there</p>
<p>Today BP has declared Gulf waters clean, as if Mother Nature were just a toilet you can poop in and flush. But I?ve been to the Gulf shores. Dig down 10 inches in the shoals off Gulfport, Miss., and you?ll hit Deepwater Horizon crude. Biologist Rick Steiner told me BP?s poisonous sludge will remain just under the surface for another 40 years. Hidden ? just like BP?s crimes.</p>

<article id="0000313" published-at="2011-11-01" title="Holding penalty"><p>One afternoon in September, immigration activists and religious leaders joined politicians standing proudly outside the Cook County Clerk?s Office to celebrate a ?victory for immigrant rights.?</p>
<p>?We are committed to the protection of all citizens of Cook County and improving the treatment of immigrants,? said Cook County Commissioner Jesus Garcia, who had earlier voted along with nine others to approve an ordinance that will end the practice of holding Cook County Jail inmates for immigration purposes.</p>
<p>Under the Fair and Equal County for Immigrants ordinance, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart can decline to enforce an immigration-hold request, also known as a ?detainer,? unless the federal government agrees in writing to reimburse the county for the cost of detention. The ordinance also bars immigration agents from having access to county jail inmates without a criminal warrant.</p>
<p>?The practice of detaining people by the sheriff was also eroding the trust and relationship between residents of various communities,? said Garcia, who drafted the ordinance. ?It was undermining public safety.?</p>
<p>Cook County?s ordinance is among the first enacted in the country designed to resist Secure Communities, a controversial federal program that aims to deport immigrants who have been arrested by local law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>Amalia Pallares, associate professor of political science and Latin American and Latino studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said the spirit of the ordinance could be emulated in other counties.</p>
<p>?It is about the rights of immigrants,? said Pallares, who also co-edited a book about immigration activism in Chicago. ?Every local government has to figure out what makes sense to them, but the spirit can be used to uphold the rights of undocumented immigrants who don?t have a criminal background.?</p>
<p>As of Aug. 31, immigration detainers were issued for 342 inmates among the daily average population of about 9,000 at Cook County Jail, shows a Chicago Reporter analysis of Cook County inmate reports. Last year, 1,665 inmates were placed under immigration hold.About 87 percent have been charged with a felony, and the rest had a misdemeanor charge, the analysis shows.</p>
<p>Since the ordinance was approved, 48 inmates?36 of them with felony charges?have been released after they posted bond, said Steve Patterson, a spokesman for the Cook County Sheriff?s Office.</p>
<p>It costs $143 a day to house an inmate at the county jail. By not holding inmates, Garcia said, the ordinance would save the county $15 million a year. Patterson said that number is actually smaller?about $250,000?a year.</p>
<p>A recent federal court ruling cleared the way for the ordinance. An Indiana court case ruled in June that the detainer requests made by immigration enforcement officials are only a request and not criminal warrants.</p>
<p>The ordinance also came after immigration activists rallied around what they say is a flawed implementation of Secure Communities, Garcia said.</p>
<p>Many undocumented immigrants were being booked into immigration custody after an arrest but not conviction, he said.</p>
<p>The Reporter analysis of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security records bears out his claim. In Illinois, 46 percent of 3,023 people who were booked into immigration custody between Nov. 24, 2009, and July 25, 2011, were never charged with, or convicted of, the crimes for which they were arrested, the analysis shows.</p>
<p>Cook County?s unease with Secure Communities began to surface in April 2009, when the sheriff?s office opted not to share fingerprints of its arrestees with the homeland security department.</p>
<p>?We were trying to get answers from [the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] about Secure Communities,? Patterson said. ?We got a lot of runarounds and conflicting answers.?</p>
<p>Nicole Nava, spokeswoman for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said the ordinance would release criminals back into communities instead of deporting them.</p>
<p>Her agency ?places detainers on aliens arrested on criminal charges to ensure that dangerous criminals are not released from prisons/jails and into our communities,? Nava wrote.</p>
<p>Nava offered three examples of undocumented immigrants being released back to Cook County, including the release of a 32-year-old Mexican charged with a felony and traffic offenses after running a red light and then punching the officer who arrested him.</p>
<p>Garcia said the ordinance was needed to clarify any confusion and to stop immigration enforcement overreach. The ordinance will also protect the county from liability in cases where immigration officials ask the county to hold someone they wrongly suspect as being undocumented.</p>
<p>?We don?t detain people without probable cause,? he said. ?That would violate constitutional guarantees like due process and equal protection. But these detainers are not based on probable cause.?</p>

<article id="0000314" published-at="2016-03-04" title="Key Executive Changes Shake Up Microsoft"><p></p>
<p>Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella continues to put his stamp on the company, announcing Wednesday an executive shuffle that involves the departure of former Nokia Corp. chief Stephen Elop.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>Mr. Elop was the biggest surprise departure in the executive shuffle. Two other Microsoft executives, Kirill Tatarinov and Eric Rudder, will, like Mr. Elop "leave Microsoft after a designated transition period," the company said in a news release. Separately, Mark Penn, who had served in a senior strategist role, is leaving Microsoft as well.</p>
<p>Mr. Elop's departure is the latest sign Microsoft is hitting the reset button on its struggling smartphone hardware business. The more than $9 billion purchase of Nokia's handset business--a deal struck by Mr. Nadella's predecessor Steve Ballmer in late 2013--was supposed to make Microsoft a relevant player in smartphones.</p>
<p>Microsoft declined to make Mr. Elop available for an interview.</p>
<p>Instead under Mr. Elop's leadership at Microsoft, the company's Windows smartphones lost market share and bled red ink. The company recently said it planned to further cut costs at the smartphone business and other hardware units. Nokia already was targeted for thousands of job cuts in the biggest layoffs in Microsoft's history, announced last year.</p>
<p>Last July, in an email that rankled some with an introduction of "Hello there," Mr. Elop outlined 12,500 Microsoft job cuts and underlined the challenges the unit was facing.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>"It is particularly important to recognize that the role of phones within Microsoft is different than it was within Nokia," he wrote. "Our device strategy must reflect Microsoft's strategy and must be accomplished within an appropriate financial envelope. Therefore, we plan to make some changes."</p>
<p>Mr. Elop had been viewed as a potential successor to Mr. Ballmer, and his return to the company was seen as setting the table for him to win respect in Microsoft's board room as directors searched for a new CEO. In February 2014, Mr. Nadella was appointed to the job.</p>
<p>Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets, said Elop's exit "speaks to Microsoft's view that Nokia and the overall mobile strategy was clearly not heading down the right path."</p>
<p>Microsoft's hardware devices businesses, which Mr. Elop ran, will now be folded into a new division with Microsoft's operating systems group. Terry Myerson, also an executive vice president, will lead the division.</p></article>
<article id="0000319" published-at="2017-10-04" title="Big Tobacco's New U.S. Ads Will Be Critical of Smoking -- WSJ"><p>This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (October 4, 2017).</p>
<p>Broadcast television networks and metro newspapers are about to get a boost from an unexpected but familiar source: Big Tobacco.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>It's an old media buy to resolve an old fight. Starting as soon as next month, Altria Group Inc. and British American Tobacco PLC will begin running court-mandated ads to put to rest a lawsuit brought nearly two decades ago by the U.S. Department of Justice over misleading statements the industry had made about cigarettes and their health effects.</p>
<p>The television spots, between 30 and 45 seconds long, will run in prime time five days a week for 52 weeks, and will appear mostly on ABC, CBS or NBC, Altria said. They won't have the graphic images of a typical antismoking public service announcement. Instead, these ads will be reminiscent of the disclosure statement at the end of a pharmaceutical ad, displaying court-mandated text in black on a white screen with a voice narration.</p>
<p>"Altria, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard, and Philip Morris USA intentionally designed cigarettes to make them more addictive," one ad will say. Another reads: "More people die every year from smoking than from murder, AIDS, suicide, drugs, car crashes, and alcohol, combined."</p>
<p>Although the starkness of the black-and-white text ads could be persuasive because they are so out of the ordinary, ad executives said, it is unclear how effective they will be in an age when fewer young people are watching broadcast TV or reading newspapers.</p>
<p>"The good news for the tobacco companies is they'll avoid a lot of their younger audience" who would be more likely to see a video ad on Facebook than a prime-time TV ad, said John Boiler, co-founder of 72andSunny, an agency that does work for the antitobacco nonprofit Truth Campaign. "I think they're getting off kind of lightly."</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Marlboro maker Altria, which owns Philip Morris USA, estimates that it will spend $31 million to broadcast and publish the statements on TV, in newspapers, on company-owned websites and in pamphlets tucked inside the cellophane wrappers on cigarette packs. A spokesman for BAT's U.S. subsidiary Reynolds American, which makes Camels and acquired Newport maker Lorillard in 2015, declined to say how much the company expects to spend.</p>
<p>All the defendants named in the Justice Department's 1999 lawsuit are now owned by either Altria or BAT.</p>
<p>Full-page print ads will appear in at least 45 newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal, starting as soon as Nov. 26, according to a document filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Monday evening by attorneys for Altria, BAT and the Justice Department, outlining their agreement. The print ads will run on five weekends spread over about four months, according to the court filing. Ads will also appear on the newspapers' websites.</p>
<p>Tobacco companies used to be a staple of Madison Avenue ad agencies with figures like the Marlboro Man and Joe Camel, but they have sharply curbed their advertising spending in the U.S. They are no longer allowed to advertise their products on television or billboards, and their legal settlements have funded more than $1 billion dollars in antismoking campaigns.</p>
<p>"This industry has changed dramatically over the last 20 years," Altria's General Counsel Murray Garnick said in a statement, noting that the company supported the 2009 law that gave the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate tobacco. "We're focused on the future and... working to develop less risky tobacco products."</p>
<p>The FDA recently unveiled plans to overhaul how it regulates tobacco, aiming to reduce nicotine in cigarettes so they're no longer addictive and encourage cigarette smokers to switch to less harmful alternatives.</p>

<article id="0000320" published-at="2012-04-24" title="New book recalls British Empire's attempt to intervene in Afghanistan"><p>One of Afghanistan?s nicknames is ?the graveyard of empires.?</p>
<p>First the British Empire swept in and tried to conquer the land, only to be driven out in the deadliest massacre of British soldiers in the empire's history. Then the Soviet Union invaded, only to be driven out by determined, and U.S.-backed, resistance.</p>
<p>A short time later, the Soviet Union collapsed. Though it was much longer, the British Empire also waned in the years after the Afghanistan disaster.</p>
<p>Now, a new book highlights that first attempt to intervene in Afghanistan, to protect its valuable possessions in India.</p>
<p>The book is called ?The Dark Defile: Britain?s Catastrophic Invasion of Afghanistan, 1838-1842." It did not end well for Britain.</p>
<p>Modern readers may find it interesting how some of the issues that faced the Brits back then have parallels today.</p>
<p>Author Diana Preston said after a relatively easy and successful initial invasion, beginning in 1838, a more friendly regime was installed.</p>
<p>But the new regime struggled to win popularity; it was seen as dependent on foreign military power for its position. Plus, its corruption alienated many, its armed forces were weak and of dubious loyalty and it was unable to manage complex tribal relationships.</p>
<p>Not at all unlike the regime of Hamid Karzai, who the U.S. installed as leader shortly after its invasion.</p>
<p>The Afghans rebelled and forced the British to retreat from Kabul in winter 1841-1842. Despite promises of safe passage, the 4,500-man army was massacred, along with its support staff and even the soldiers? wives and children. More than 16,000 perished in the ?dark defiles? on the road back to India.</p>
<p>Only one British man escaped and made it to the U.S. base at Jalalabad, Dr. William Brydon,</p>
<p>The British returned to Kabul in the summer of 1842 to exact retribution and rescue the British and Indians who had been taken prisoner. They burned Kabul?s Grand Bazaar then abandoned Afghanistan to its fate.</p>
<p>Afghans still remember the war with a mixture of pride and anger, Preston said, as the first in a long series of failed attempts by foreign super-powers to dominate their country.</p></article>
<article id="0000321" published-at="2015-05-10" title="Hosni Mubarak and Sons Sentenced to 3 Years in Prison, Likely to Go Free"><p>CAIRO ? An Egyptian court sentenced former president Hosni Mubarak and his two sons to three years in jail without parole on Saturday in the retrial of a corruption case, although the trio is unlikely to go to jail again.</p>
<p>Mubarak, who ruled Egypt with an iron fist for 30 years, and his sons, Gamal and Alaa, already spent at least three years each in prison for other cases, so will probably not have to serve out the sentence.</p>
<p>The retrial was of a case in which Mubarak was sentenced to three years in prison in May last year on charges of diverting public funds and using the money to upgrade family properties. His two sons were given four-year jail terms in the same case.</p>
<p>But Egypt's high court later overturned the convictions and ordered a retrial.</p>
<p>"The ruling of the court is three years in prison without parole for Mohamed Hosni Mubarak and Gamal Mohamed Hosni Mubarak and Alaa Mohamed Hosni Mubarak," Judge Hassan Hassanein announced on Saturday.</p>
<p>Mubarak's treatment by the courts since being toppled from the presidency during the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings has been perceived by his opponents as too lenient and raised doubts about Egypt's transition toward democracy.</p>
<p>Charges against him of conspiring to kill protesters during the uprising, centered around Cairo's Tahrir Square, were dropped, and some of his associates were released from jail.</p>

<article id="0000324" published-at="2018-01-16" title="King children criticize Trump, decry racism on MLK holiday"><p>ATLANTA (AP) ? Two of Martin Luther King Jr.'s children and the pastor of his historic Atlanta church marked the national King holiday Monday with sharp denunciations of President Donald Trump, focusing on disparaging remarks he is said to have made about African countries and Haitian immigrants. Angry pro-Haiti protesters and Trump supporters yelled at each other from opposite sides of a street near the president's Florida resort.</p>
<p>At gatherings across the nation, activists, residents and teachers honored the late civil rights leader on what would have been his 89th birthday and ahead of the 50th anniversary of his assassination in Memphis, Tennessee. But in the many speeches delivered from pulpits and podiums across the country, Trump's name came up nearly as often as King's, with speakers indicating that his turbulent presidency was undermining efforts to ease racial tensions in the U.S.</p>
<p>The president spent his first Martin Luther King Jr. Day in office buffeted by claims that during a meeting with senators on immigration last week, he used a vulgarity to describe African countries and questioned the need to allow more Haitians into the U.S. He also is said to have asked why the country couldn't have more immigrants from nations like Norway.</p>
<p>In Washington, King's eldest son, Martin Luther King III, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=db44oYipj74&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be" type="external">criticized</a> Trump, saying, "When a president insists that our nation needs more citizens from white states like Norway, I don't even think we need to spend any time even talking about what it says and what it is."</p>
<p>He added, "We got to find a way to work on this man's heart."</p>
<p>In Atlanta, King's daughter, the Rev. Bernice King, told hundreds of people who packed the pews of the Ebenezer Baptist Church that they "cannot allow the nations of the world to embrace the words that come from our president as a reflection of the true spirit of America."</p>
<p>"We are one people, one nation, one blood, one destiny. ... All of civilization and humanity originated from the soils of Africa," Bernice King said. "Our collective voice in this hour must always be louder than the one who sometimes does not reflect the legacy of my father."</p>
<p>Church pastor the Rev. Raphael Warnock also took issue with Trump's campaign slogan to "Make America Great Again."</p>
<p>Warnock said he thinks America "is already great ... in large measure because of Africa and African people."</p>
<p>Down the street from Trump's Mar-a-Lago retreat in Palm Beach, Florida, on Monday, Haitian protesters and Trump supporters yelled at each other from opposing corners. Trump was staying at the resort for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. Video posted by WPEC-TV showed several hundred pro-Haiti demonstrators yelling from one side of the street Monday while waving Haitian flags. The Haitians and their supporters shouted "Our country is not a shithole," referring to comments the president reportedly made. Trump has said that is not the language he used.</p>
<p>The smaller pro-Trump contingent waved American flags and campaign posters and yelled "Trump is making America great again." One man could be seen telling the Haitians to leave the country. Police kept the sides apart.</p>
<p>Trump dedicated his weekly address to the nation, released Monday, to King.</p>
<p>"Dr. King's dream is our dream, it is the American dream, it's the promise stitched into the fabric of our nation, etched into the hearts of our people and written into the soul of humankind," he said in the address, which he tweeted to his followers. "It is the dream of a world where people are judged by who they are, not how they look or where they come from."</p>
<p>The president's remarks appeared not to resonate with the Rev. Al Sharpton, who also used the holiday to take aim at the racial rhetoric Trump is said to have used.</p>
<p>"Trump Tower is in the wrong state," Sharpton told a crowd of 200 at the National Action Network in Harlem. He said it was embarrassing that Trump is from New York. "What we're going to do about Donald Trump is going to be the spirit of Martin Luther King Day," he said.</p>

<article id="0000328" published-at="2018-11-01" title="Cold cash"><p></p>
<p>I?ve heard politicians and analysts say that campaign finance reform is not a sexy issue. Perhaps that explains my attraction to it. I am not a sexy person. I wear thick, high-waisted cotton underwear without apology. The issue of campaign finance reform and I were made for each other.</p>
<p>Under our current system, it costs a phenomenal amount of money to run for office. Politicians are forced to prioritize their list of evils, accepting money from groups they?d rather not be beholden to in order to stand firm against more evil evils.</p>
<p>If I were running against a popular, monied candidate whom I suspected of being a Nazi, I might well take money from a hot dog lobbyist who, with a wink and a nod, asked me to vote against stiffer regulations on the acceptable percentage of insect parts in hot dogs. What, after all, are a few more fly wings in my almost-all-beef weenies compared to brownshirts goose-stepping past my neighborhood coffee shop?</p>
<p>In a way I feel sorry for politicians. They are in a bit of a pickle. As repugnant as fund raising is, they can?t get elected without it. Even a lowly citizen like me is caught in a similar predicament. Until we have campaign finance reform, I feel forced to support candidates that share my views. I did a fund-raiser for a man running for California state treasurer. There. I?ve said it. Recently, I did a Democratic fund-raiser in D.C. Common Cause was picketing out front. I was in hell. I wish someone in charge of the list of hypocrites could tell me I?m not on it, but I fear that I am.</p>
<p>After state Sen. Tom Hayden lost in the primary of the California governor?s race?typically, candidates I support do lose?anyways, after Hayden lost, I wrote him a note to inquire how I could help in his fight for campaign finance reform. He invited me to visit him on the Senate floor in Sacramento to see how things work. I was sort of a legislator for a day. It?s like being queen for a day, except there?s no tiara and you don?t cry as much.</p>
<p>Sen. Hayden can?t be bought. He apparently votes his conscience. In the eyes of many legislators, he sets a bad example. It?s like when I rinsed the syrup containers when I waitressed at the International House of Pancakes?the other waitresses hated me.</p>
<p>I really admire Sen. Hayden?s courage. Still, when we were in the hallways, I tried to pretend I didn?t know him. I might want to run for office someday.</p>
<p>I felt quite sheepish about my own fund-raising participation. I had already told Sen. Hayden about the Democratic fund-raiser in Washington, but I did purposely ixnay the undraiserfay I did for the guy running for easurertray.</p>
<p>I was amazed at how truly dull being a state senator is. At times I could barely keep my eyes open. When I first went to the Senate floor, one of our duly elected was sound asleep in a chair.</p>
<p>As each bill comes to the floor, both sides can state their views twice for two minutes. These senators are some of the worst speakers I?ve ever heard. I used to recite ?Little Orphant Annie? with more passion.</p>
<p>The California state Senate does not vote electronically; rather, it calls roll almost constantly. It?s like the recorded announcement at the airport telling you that the red zone is for loading and unloading passengers only. Some poor guy at the Senate calls those 40-or-so names in alphabetical order for hours on end. Did he audition for the job? Who failed? Maybe the guy who called out, ?Anderson, Baker, Bostick, Higgleby, Bronson . . . Damn.? The senators are so blas about this roll calling, which must be used as torture in the penal systems of some dictatorships, that they can be engrossed in conversation and, without missing a beat, yell ?aye? or ?no? and continue the conversation.</p>
<p>Eighty-something-year-old Ralph Dills was elected to office in the late 1930s. We were chatting when his name was called. He responded, ?Dills, aye,? and continued talking. Another senator asked, ?Ralph, do you know what you just voted for??</p>
<p>?No,? he said. Then he leaned towards me and said, ?That happens a lot.?</p>
<p>Considering the pace and the bulk of bills, I?m sure it does.</p>
<p>This must drive the anxious crowd of lobbyists wild. The rules say that the lobbyists may not be on the Senate floor, so they wait in the hall. They can watch the proceedings on a monitor, talk on their cellular phones, and lean on the wall to write notes to a senator on the back of their business card, which they send in with a guard or a page. A typical note says, ?I have grave concerns about Bill X. Could I speak with you?? The senator then leaves the Senate floor, which is carpeted, and goes out into the tiled hallway to be coerced. Tile good. Carpet bad.</p>
<p>As I exited the Senate floor, an old gentleman with tubes up his nose and an oxygen tank was wheeled onto the carpet. When I inquired, I was told he was a retired senator who is now a lobbyist. Before I could ask where the hell he was going, I was told senators never lose their welcome on the plush red carpeted floor. I know this is an awful thought, but this guy must be incredibly persuasive. Who?s gonna turn him down? Anything he asks could be his last wish. If he wants more fly wings in hot dogs, fine. A simple ?no? could push him over the edge.</p>
<p>I don?t think my political representatives are corrupt, but rather, like all of us, caught in a system that needs overhaul. What I saw of the state senator?s job makes cheating to get it a bit like tunneling into French Guiana. There must be only three types of legislators: true public servants, corrupt con men, and the stupidest members of the work force, who are perhaps safer there than operating heavy machinery or serving hot coffee.</p>

<p>Regina Boyles, e-mail: My brother thinks that Rush Limbaugh is the Second Coming. I?m convinced that Rush is the Antichrist. Can you find supporting evidence for either view?</p>
<p>A: Regina, dump your brother. Blood may be thicker than water, but water has a whole lot more uses.</p>
<p>Without much research, it was easy to find error in your brother?s view that Rush Limbaugh is the Second Coming. The Second Coming is Jesus? reappearance on earth, at which time something fairly bad is supposed to happen to all of us who have not accepted him as our savior?something with fire.</p>
<p>Rush Limbaugh has been with us since 1951, and I?m pretty certain we haven?t been overtaken by an inferno. It has been sweaty hot in my house recently, but I don?t believe the bad punishment coming my way after the Second Coming could be thwarted by air conditioning.</p>
<p>I can?t find as much argument against your assertion that he is the Antichrist, but here?s some: He seems too petty to be the chief evil spirit. He is avoidable and not physically compelling. His mother?s name is Millie.</p>
<p>Glen Raphael, Mountain View, Calif.: I?ve always loved peanut butter. My favorite brand is ?Old-Fashioned,? which according to the label contains ?Just peanuts and saltathat?s all!?</p>
<p>But now I read that peanut butter contains high levels of natural carcinogens. So my question is: Could the plastic peanut butters like Skippy be better for you because they have fewer peanuts? Have I been living a lie all these years?</p>
<p>A: I called Mrs. Gooch, the founder of a small chain of large health food stores here in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, I asked her not about natural carcinogens in peanuts, but about the pesticides used on peanut plants. Mrs. Gooch felt that you and I both ate too much peanut butter.</p>
<p>She also explained that if we don?t want pesticides in our food, we have to buy natural foods. She said we?re voting every time we buy a jar of peanut butter. It?s no wonder I?m stressed-out all of the time.</p>
<p>After I hung up the phone, I realized I had asked the wrong question. It took me a few weeks to recover.</p>
<p>When I reread your question, I called Dale Anne Ogar, the managing editor of the UC-Berkeley Wellness Letter. Dale said it is possible that commercial peanut butter is safer than freshly ground, which can contain the carcinogen aflatoxin.</p>
<p>Somewhere in here there?s another fine ?Murder, She Wrote? episode.</p>
<p>Larry Hudson, Greer, S.C.: Isn?t it time for the Confederate flag to be removed from the South Carolina statehouse?</p>
<p>A: Yes, I think so. I called the sergeant at arms at the South Carolina statehouse to ask how long it had been there. He said that a resolution had been passed to hang it in 1962, on the 100th anniversary of the War Between the States.</p>
<p>I don?t know why they didn?t take it down after the anniversary. However, I used to know a family who put Santa Claus on their roof in October and left him there through August. It seems like much the same problem.</p>

<article id="0000329" published-at="2017-10-31" title="Facebook says Russian ads seen by as many as 126M users"><p>WASHINGTON ? Major tech companies plan to tell Congress Tuesday that they have found additional evidence of Russian activity on their services surrounding the 2016 U.S. election.</p>
<p>Facebook, for instance, says a Russian group posted more than 80,000 times on its service during and after the election, potentially reaching as many as 126 million users. The company plans to disclose these numbers to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the testimony. The person declined to be named because the committee has not officially released the testimony.</p>
<p>Twitter plans to tell the same committee that it has uncovered and shut down 2,752 accounts linked to the same group, Russia?s Internet Research Agency, which is known for promoting pro-Russian government positions.</p>
<p>That number is nearly 14 times larger than the number of accounts Twitter handed over to congressional committees three weeks ago, according to a person familiar with the matter. This person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the new findings ahead of the hearing on Tuesday.</p>
<p>And Google announced in a blog post that it found evidence of ?limited? misuse of its services by the Russian group, as well as some YouTube channels that were likely backed by Russian agents.</p>
<p>Three hearings in two days</p>
<p>The companies are set to testify at three hearings Tuesday and Wednesday as part of congressional probes of Russian election interference.</p>
<p>Colin Stretch, Facebook?s general counsel, plans to tell the Judiciary panel that 120 pages set up by the Russian agency posted repeatedly between January 2015 and August 2017. The company estimates that roughly 29 million people were directly ?served? posts in their news feeds from the agency over that time. Those posts then spread widely on Facebook, although Stretch?s prepared testimony makes clear that many of the 126 million people reached this way may not have seen the posts.</p>
<p>These ?organic? posts that appeared in users? news feeds are distinct from more than 3,000 advertisements linked to the agency that Facebook has already turned over to congressional committees. The ads ? many of which focused on divisive social issues ? pointed people to the agency?s pages, where they could then like or share its material.</p>
<p>On Twitter, the Russia-linked accounts put out 1.4 million election-related tweets from September through Nov. 15 last year ? nearly half of them automated. The company also found nine Russian accounts that bought ads, most of which came from the state-backed news service Russia Today, or RT.</p>
<p>Twitter said last week it would no longer accept ads from RT and Sputnik, another state-sponsored news outlet. It will donate the $1.9 million it has earned from RT since 2011 to support external research into political uses of Twitter.</p>
<p>Google said that two accounts linked to the Russian group spent $4,700 on ads its platforms during the 2016 election. The company also found 18 YouTube channels likely backed by Russian agents. Those channels hosted 1,108 videos with 43 hours of material, although they racked up just 309,000 views in the U.S. between June 2015 and November 2016, Google said.</p>
<p>Preempting regulation</p>
<p>A bill unveiled earlier this month would require social media companies to keep public files of election ads and require companies to ?make reasonable efforts? to make sure that foreign individuals or entities are not purchasing political advertisements in order to influence Americans.</p>
<p>The companies haven?t commented on the proposed legislation, but say they?re at work on the problem. Last week Facebook said it will verify political ad buyers in federal elections and build transparency tools to link ads to the Facebook pages of their sponsors. Twitter has also said it will require election-related ads for candidates to disclose who is paying for them and how they are targeted.</p>
<p>Google announced on Monday that it will also verify the identity of election-related ad buyers and identify these advertisers publicly via an ad icon. It will provide a public database of election ads detailing who purchased each one, and will publish a transparency report on election ads as well.</p>
<p>The companies have been under constant pressure from Congress since it was first revealed earlier this year that Russians had infiltrated some of their platforms. Facebook has already spent more than $8.4 million lobbying the government this year, according to federal disclosure forms.</p>
<p>All three firms are expected to face questions about what evidence of Russian interference they found on their services, as well as why they didn?t find it earlier. They will almost certainly do what they can to convince lawmakers that they can fix the problem on their own, without the need for regulation.</p>
<p>Beyond ads</p>
<p>The issue goes far beyond ads. Fake news, fake events, propaganda and other misinformation spread far and wide on social media services in 2016 without the need for paid advertisements. But regulating online speech would be more difficult for U.S. lawmakers.</p>
<p>In addition, analysts and online speech advocates have warned that policing internet election ads is not the same thing as doing so in print newspapers or on TV. Automated advertising platforms allow basically anyone with an internet account and a credit card to place an ad with little or no oversight from the companies.</p>
<p>Facebook has said it is building machine learning tools to address this issue, but didn?t provide details.</p>

<article id="0000330" published-at="2018-11-01" title="Secret Leaked Israeli Cable Confirm Israeli-Saudi Coordination To Provoke War"><p>Early this morning, Israeli Channel 10 news published a leaked diplomatic cable which had been sent to all Israeli ambassadors throughout the world concerning the&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-11-06/making-sense-saudis-game-thobes" type="external">chaotic events</a>&amp;#160;that unfolded over the weekend in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, which began with&amp;#160;Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri?s unexpected resignation after he was&amp;#160;summoned to Riyadh by his Saudi-backers, and led to the Saudis announcing that&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-11-06/verge-catastrophe-saudi-arabia-says-lebanon-declared-war" type="external">Lebanon had ?declared war?</a>&amp;#160;against the kingdom.</p>
<p>Related |&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">Saudi Arabia Claims Lebanon, Iran Declared War Against It</a></p>
<p>The classified embassy cable, written in Hebrew,&amp;#160;constitutes the first formal evidence proving that the Saudis and Israelis are deliberately coordinating&amp;#160;to escalate the situation in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The explosive classified Israeli cable reveals the following:</p>
<p>As is already&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-09-11/breaking-news-saudi-crown-princes-secret-visit-israel-brings-embassy-scramble" type="external">well-known</a>, the Saudi and Israeli common cause against perceived Iranian influence and expansion in places like Syria, Lebanon and Iraq of late has led the historic bitter enemies down a pragmatic path of unspoken cooperation as both seem to have placed&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-08-24/netanyahu-putin-iran-must-leave-syria-or-we-will-act" type="external">the break up of the so-called ?Shia crescent?</a>&amp;#160;as their primary policy goal in the region.</p>
<p>For Israel, Hezbollah has long been its greatest foe, which Israeli leaders see as an extension of Iran?s territorial presence right up against the Jewish state?s northern border.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Israeli reporter who obtained the document is&amp;#160;Barak Ravid, senior diplomatic correspondent for&amp;#160; <a href="http://news.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=1272790&amp;amp;sid=126" type="external">Channel 10 News</a>. Ravid announced the following through Twitter&amp;#160; <a href="https://twitter.com/BarakRavid/status/927629611713941505" type="external">yesterday</a>:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Watch today?s Hebrew broadcast Channel 10 News report which features the Israeli diplomatic cable ? the text of which is featured in Channel 10?s screenshot (below) ?&amp;#160; <a href="http://news.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=1272790&amp;amp;sid=126" type="external">here</a>.&amp;#160;</p>

<p>Below is a rough translation of the classified Israeli embassy cable using Google Translate as released by&amp;#160; <a href="http://news.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=1272790&amp;amp;sid=126" type="external">Israel?s Channel 10 News</a>:</p>
<p>Al-Hariri?s resignation proves that the international argument that Hezbollah?s inclusion in the government is a recipe for stability is basically wrong. This artificial unity creates paralysis and the inability of local sovereign powers to make decisions that serve their national interest. It effectively turns them into hostages under physical threat and are&amp;#160;forced to promote the interests of a foreign power ? Iran&amp;#160;? even if this may endanger the security of their country.</p>
<p>The events in Lebanon and the launching of a ballistic missile by the signatories to the Riyadh agreement&amp;#160;require increased pressure on Iran and Hezbollah on a range of issues from the production of ballistic missiles to regional subversion.?</p>
<p>Thus, as things increasingly heat up in the Middle East, it appears the anti-Iran and anti-Shia&amp;#160;alliance of convenience between the Saudis and Israelis appear to have placed Lebanon in the crosshairs of yet another looming Israeli-Hezbollah war. And the war in Yemen will also continue to escalate ? perhaps now with increasingly overt Israeli political support. According to&amp;#160; <a href="http://news.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=1272790&amp;amp;sid=126" type="external">Channel 10?s commentary</a>&amp;#160;(translation),</p>
<p>In the cable, Israeli ambassadors were also asked to convey&amp;#160;an unusual message of support for Saudi Arabia&amp;#160;in light of the war in which it is involved in Yemen against the Iranian-backed rebels.?</p>
<p>All of this comes, perhaps&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-10-28/shocking-viral-interview-qatar-confesses-secrets-behind-syrian-war" type="external">not coincidentally</a>, at the very moment ISIS is on the verge of complete annihilation (partly at the hands of Hezbollah), and as both Israel and Saudi Arabia have of late increasingly declared&amp;#160;? <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-09-11/breaking-news-saudi-crown-princes-secret-visit-israel-brings-embassy-scramble" type="external">red lines</a>?&amp;#160;concerning perceived Iranian influence across the region as well as broad Hezbollah acceptance and popularity within Lebanon.</p>
<p>What has both Israel and the Saudis worried is the fact that&amp;#160;the Syrian war has strengthened Hezbollah, not weakened it. And now we have&amp;#160;smoking gun internal evidence that Israel is quietly formalizing its unusual alliance with Saudi Arabia&amp;#160;and its power-hungry and hawkish crown prince&amp;#160;Mohammed bin Salman.</p>

<article id="0000331" published-at="2016-04-01" title="Obama?s war with the news media goes international"><p>Ever since he became president, Barack Obama has had it out with the press?from the White House?s own press corps, which has been reduced to acting as stenographers feeding on every press release fed to it by Obama?s press secretary, to recent calls for a federal agency to combat ?disinformation? from foreign news sources.</p>
<p>After Obama?s recent trip to Argentina, which coincided with the 40th anniversary of that nation?s fascist military coup, Argentina?s neo-fascist president and Obama?s newest best friend Mauricio Macri, announced that Argentina was pulling out of the Latin American consortium of nations that fund TeleSur as a rival to Western-controlled news media.</p>
<p>No sooner had Air Force One left Buenos Aires, Argentina?s U.S.-backed right-wing government announced that it was selling its shares in TeleSur, a Caracas-based news network started in 2005 by Venezuela?s late president Hugo Chavez. In addition to Argentina and Venezuela, TeleSur was financed by Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>Hern?n Lombardi, Macri?s handpicked crony named as head of the government?s public media department, complained that TeleSur prevented Macri supporters from having input on TeleSur?s financial and editorial decisions. A number of Latin American journalists have criticized Argentina for its actions against TeleSur, especially since Argentina?s Televisi?n Digital Abierta (TDA) cable service, which provides cable TV service to 80 percent of Argentina?s television viewers, is dropping TeleSur from its offerings.</p>
<p>The Argentine decision resulted in Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to liken the Macri government to the Argentine military dictatorship. ?It?s the same as when&amp;#160;30,000 young people disappeared in Argentina between 1976 and 1983; they are trying to make Telesur disappear.&amp;#160;It?s the same media oligarchy,? Maduro said in response to Argentina?s move. Maduro is currently facing a recall attempt by the right-wing opposition-controlled Venezuelan National Assembly that is supported by Washington and the complex of George Soros-linked NGOs in Venezuela. If Maduro is ousted by the opposition, TeleSur will either be scrapped by the rightists or privatized and become indistinguishable from Spanish-language commercial networks like Univision.</p>
<p>One of Macri?s first moves was to fire all the long-time hosts on Argentine Public Radio and replace them with his right-wing and Zionist cronies, many of them from the pro-fascist newspaper La Nacion. The same purge has also been waged against the Argentine Public Broadcasting Corporation. Macri?s actions against the press resulted in not one complaint from Obama, who has been waging a similar battle against independent media at home and abroad.</p>
<p>In Washington, Ohio Republican Senator Rob Portman and Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy are sponsoring a Senate bill titled the ?Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act? that seeks to counter ?foreign propaganda and disinformation? and establish foreign networks and news sources to counter foreign propaganda abroad. The bill would also create a Center for Information Analysis and Response within the State Department that would work with the Department of Defense, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Broadcasting Board of Governors (that board that oversees Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and others), the U.S. intelligence community, and other relevant agencies.?</p>
<p>Murphy, who would not have sponsored the legislation without a wink and nod from the Obama White House, said the new agency would be ?telling counter-narratives to the Russian story, to the Chinese propaganda stories all around the world.? The U.S. effort is particularly aimed at the state-owned RT satellite news network of Russia and CCTV satellite news network of China. The U.S. has already shown what it is prepared to do by supporting Argentina?s decision to help cripple TeleSur. Iran?s PressTV and some independent Arab networks are also in the gun sights of Portman?s and Murphy?s new propaganda agency. Al Jazeera America, seen by millions of Americans on cable, is due to go off the air in April after Qatar decided to end the American venture, which has been based in Washington, DC. Al Jazeera?s Arabic service from Doha will continue.</p>
<p>The new legislation would effectively recreate the of U.S. Information Agency (USIA), which was scrapped under the Reagan administration. However, unlike the USIA, the new U.S. propaganda agency would not be bound by the 1948 Smith-Mundt Act, which prohibited the distribution or broadcast of USIA propaganda within the United States. U.S. audiences would be subjected to the same degree of U.S. government propaganda as foreign audiences under the Portman-Murphy bill.</p>
<p>The Obama administration drove the last stake into the heart of the Smith-Mundt Act in 2013 when the National Defense Authorization Act had a rider attached to it by Representatives Mac Thornberry (R-TX) and Adam Smith (D-WA) that permitted U.S. funded media operations like the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and Radio and TV Marti to provide to the American public programming that Smith-Mundt previously permitted only for foreign audiences.?</p>
<p>The Portman-Murphy bill is backed by George Soros?s and the CIA?s network of contrivances in Washington, including the U.S. Institute of Peace and the Atlantic Council. Critics of the bill claim that it represents a clear violation of First Amendment rights of freedom of the press and freedom of speech. The involvement of the Pentagon and CIA in the new U.S. propaganda agency is to ensure that U.S. propaganda and counter-propaganda efforts contain a heavy dosage of psychological warfare operations (PSYOPS) and military deception (MILDEC) to ensure U.S. control over the information space.</p>

<article id="0000332" published-at="2011-09-23" title="Breaking with Serbia Tough for Kosovo Serbs"><p>by Matthew Brunwasser</p>
<p>The Albanian-dominated government in Pristina has very little presence here. Institutions like the post office, schools and hospitals are funded and managed by Belgrade. But Serbia wants to join the European Union. And the EU only accepts members who have normal relations with their neighbors. Many countries have made it clear they don't consider Serbia's presence in Kosovo very neighborly.</p>
<p>"The pressure by the international community and by Pristina has never been stronger than in the past 2-3 months,"? says Tatjana Lazarevic, a Serb who works at a community development organization in the divided city of Mitrovica, which marks the beginning of the Serbian-controlled north. Lazarevic says its absurd to even consider cutting off the institutions.</p>
<p>Lazarevic says: "Why would anyone dismantle a system which works for 12 years, on the basis of free will of 100 percent of the Serbian population of the north? I would say if the Serbian institutions are dismantled, 100 percent of the people in the north would flee."?</p>
<p>It's not that Serbs so strongly oppose Albanians running their post office. Controlling institutions is about political power. The wounds from the 1999 war have not healed. Despite the fear and hatred between the two communities, some two-thirds of Serbs in Kosovo live in the south under rule by Pristina. While distrust is high, ethnic violence is rare. Kosovo's form of government was created by the Ahtisaari plan, named after the Finnish Nobel laureate who designed it. It gives strong protections for minorities' rights. Of the 16 Kosovo government ministers in Pristina, three are Serbs.</p>
<p>Like Nenad Rasic. "Our only concern as gov representatives, is not to make tension or radical moves that could make the Serbs panic,"? says Rasic.</p>
<p>Many Kosovo Serbs fled after the 1999 war and he's afraid more might leave: some out of fear and some for economic reasons. Belgrade helps Serbs get by in Kosovo through jobs and subsidies. If they disappear, Rasic says, Serbs may also leave for economic reasons.</p>
<p>"The only way we can help the Serbs in Kosovo is provide them the benefits,"? says Rasic.</p>
<p>Ahtisaari is based on the decentralization of powers and offers the north limited autonomy. The plan's first step would be to hold local elections in the north for communities to choose their leaders. There are already eight Serbian municipalities in the south, which were elected last year. Voter turnout by Serbs was around 47 percent. Peiter Feith heads the executive body implementing Ahtisaari. He says Serbs in the north haven't yet seen the benefits of participation.</p>
<p>Feith says: "We have not yet, because of local resistance, been able to hold elections in Mitrovica North. There are other provisions which would give far reaching autonomy to the Serb community. For instance, they would be allowed to work with Belgrade and get support from Belgrade in the sectors of health and education and there are other things that can be thought of."?</p>
<p>Serbia's lead negotiator in Belgrade ? Pristina dialogue, Borko Stefanovic says: "That's a dream scenario of Mr. Feith, but he's wrong."?</p>
<p>Stefanovic says Serbia will not stop supporting Serbian institutions in Kosovo. And that the international community is deceiving itself.</p>
<p>"First of all, we have no intention to help in creating something called an independent Kosovo,"? says Stefanovic. "The other thing is that the Serbs in the north would never accept Pristina-based institutions. And they know it."?</p>
<p>But while the north of Kosovo is mostly Serbian, some five percent of the population is Albanian, like Adem Mripa. He says at some point, Serbia will have to let go.</p>
<p>"I believe that Belgrade should promote reconciliation, and persuade Serbs to live equally with Albanians in Kosovo,"? says Mripa. "They must know that this country will be called Kosovo and not Serbia. I think that pressure on Belgrade from the international community is the only way to promote reconciliation in this part of Kosovo."?</p>
<p>Kosovo remains a highly charged political issue for Serbs, an underground reservoir of emotional power which politicians can easily tap into. While polls show Serbian voters think the EU and economic issues are more important than Kosovo, no one expects any dramatic moves before Serbia's national elections in April.</p></article>

<p></p>
<p>Blackwater?s recent troubles (the alleged indiscriminate killing of Iraqi civilians by the company?s ?independent contractors?) have led to speculation that Erik Prince, Blackwater?s founder and president, may seek to lead his company into new and perhaps less controversial lines of business. What better way to do that than by marketing a signature handgun? That?s right, the embattled private military firm has apparently partnered with arms manufacturer Sig Sauer to offer a ?Blackwater Special Edition P226,? a 9mm handgun. According to the ad ( <a href="http://blog.wired.com/defense/2007/10/blackwater-spec.html" type="external">posted to Wired?s Danger Zone</a>), ?When personal protection of world leaders in high-risk environments is your job then you only want the best equipment.?

<article id="0000334" published-at="2013-07-03" title="Celebrating Progressive Patriotism on the 4th of July"><p><a href="http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/flag.gif" type="external"></a>July 4 is an occasion for Americans to express their patriotism. But the ways we do so are as diverse as our nation.</p>
<p>To some, patriotism means ?my country ? right or wrong.? To others, it means loyalty to a set of principles, and thus requires dissent and criticism when those in power violate those standards. As Martin Luther King said in a speech during the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955, ?the great glory of American democracy is the right to protest for right.?</p>
<p>Former President George W. Bush expressed the first version, questioning the patriotism of anyone who challenged his war on terrorism. In his 2001 State of the Union address, for example, Bush claimed, ?You?re either with us, or with the terrorists.? He introduced the Patriot Act to codify this view, giving the government new powers to suppress dissent. (The anti-war movement countered with bumper stickers illustrated with an American flag that proclaimed ?Peace is Patriotic.?)</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The flag, as a symbol of the nation, is not owned by the administration in power, but by the people. We battle over what it means, but all Americans ? across the political spectrum ? have an equal right to claim the flag as their own.</p>
<p>Progressives understand that people can disagree with their government and still love their country and its ideals.</p>
<p>Indeed, throughout U.S. history, many American radicals and progressive reformers have proudly asserted their patriotism. To them, America stood for basic democratic values ? economic and social equality, mass participation in politics, free speech and civil liberties, elimination of the second-class citizenship of women and racial minorities, a welcome mat for the world?s oppressed people. The reality of corporate power, right-wing xenophobia and social injustice only fueled progressives? allegiance to these principles and the struggle to achieve them.</p>
<p>Most Americans are unaware that much of our patriotic culture ? including many of the leading symbols and songs ? was created by people with decidedly progressive sympathies.</p>
<p>For example, the Pledge of Allegiance was authored and promoted by Francis Bellamy, a leading Christian socialist. Bellamy penned the Pledge of Allegiance in 1892 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus? discovery of America by promoting use of the flag in public schools.</p>
<p>It was the Gilded Age, an era of major political and social conflict. Reformers were outraged by the widening gap between rich and poor, and the behavior of corporate robber barons who were exploiting workers, gouging consumers and corrupting politics with their money. Workers were organizing unions. Farmers joined forces in the Populist movement to leash the power of banks, railroads and utility companies. Progressive reformers fought for child labor laws, against slum housing and in favor of women?s suffrage. Radicals were gaining new converts.</p>
<p>In foreign affairs, Americans were battling over the nation?s role in the world. America was beginning to act like an imperial power, justifying its expansion with a combination of white supremacy, manifest destiny and spreading democracy. At the time, nativist groups in the North and Midwest as well as the South were pushing for restrictions on immigrants ? Catholics, Jews and Asians ? deemed to be polluting Protestant America. In the South, the outcome of the Civil War still inflamed regional passions. Many Southerners, including Civil War veterans, swore allegiance to the Confederate flag.</p>
<p>Bellamy (cousin of best-selling radical writer Edward Bellamy) believed that unbridled capitalism, materialism and individualism betrayed America?s promise. He hoped the Pledge of Allegiance would promote a different moral vision to counter the rampant greed he thought was undermining the nation. Bellamy initially intended to use the phrase ?liberty, fraternity and equality,? but concluded that the radical rhetoric of the French Revolution wouldn?t sit well with many Americans. So he coined the phrase, ?one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all,? intending it to express a more egalitarian vision of America, a secular patriotism to help unite a divided nation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"The New Colossus," by Emma Lazarus, on a plaque in the base of the Statue of Liberty (wikicommons)</p>
<p></p>
<p>And there was Katharine Lee Bates, a professor of English at Wellesley College. Bates was an accomplished and published poet, whose book&amp;#160;America the Beautiful and Other Poems&amp;#160;includes a sequence of poems expressing outrage at U.S. imperialism in the Philippines. A member of progressive-reform circles in the Boston area, concerned about labor rights, urban slums and women?s suffrage, an ardent feminist, for decades she lived with and loved her Wellesley colleague Katharine Coman, an economist and social activist.</p>
<p>?America the Beautiful,? written in 1893, not only speaks to the beauty of the American continent but also reflects her view that U.S. imperialism undermines the nation?s core values of freedom and liberty. The poem?s final words ? ?and crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea? ? are an appeal for social justice rather than the pursuit of wealth.</p>
<p>In the Depression years and during World War II, the fusion of populist, egalitarian and anti-racist values with patriotic expression reached full flower.</p>
<p>Langston Hughes? poem, ?Let America Be America Again,? written in 1936, contrasted the nation?s promise with its mistreatment of his fellow African-Americans, the poor, Native Americans, workers, farmers and immigrants:</p>
<p>O, let my land be a land where Liberty Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath But opportunity is real, and life is free Equality is in the air we breathe.</p>
<p>In 1939, composer Earl Robinson teamed with lyricist John La Touche to write ?Ballad for Americans,? which was performed on the CBS radio network by Paul Robeson, accompanied by chorus and orchestra. This 11-minute cantata provided a musical review of American history, depicted as a struggle between the ?nobody who?s everybody? and an elite that fails to understand the real, democratic essence of America.</p>
<p>Robeson, at the time one of the best-known performers on the world stage, became, through this work, a voice of America. Broadcasts and recordings of ?Ballad for Americans? (by Bing Crosby as well as Robeson) were immensely popular. In the summer of 1940, it was performed at the national conventions of both the Republican and Communist parties. The work soon became a staple in school choral performances, but it was literally ripped out of many public school songbooks after Robinson and Robeson were identified with the radical left and blacklisted during the McCarthy period. Since then, however, ?Ballad for Americans? has been periodically revived, notably during the bicentennial celebration in 1976, when a number of pop and country singers performed it in concerts and on TV.</p>
<p>Aaron Copland?s ?Fanfare for the Common Man? and ?A Lincoln Portrait,? both written in 1942, are now patriotic musical standards, regularly performed at major civic events. Few Americans know that Copland was a member of a radical composers? group.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Woody Guthrie (AP Photo/File)</p>
<p></p>
<p>The words to ?This Land Is Your Land? reflect Guthrie?s assumption that patriotism and support for the underdog were interconnected. In this song, Guthrie celebrated America?s natural beauty and bounty, but criticized the country for its failure to share its riches. This is reflected in the song?s last and least-known verse, which Pete Seeger and Bruce Springsteen included when they performed the song in January 2009 at a pre-inaugural concert in front of the Lincoln Memorial, with President-elect Obama in the audience:</p>
<p>One bright sunny morning; In the shadow of the steeple; By the relief office; I saw my people. As they stood hungry; I stood there wondering; If this land was made for you and me.</p>
<p>During the 1960s, American progressives continued to seek ways to fuse their love of country with their opposition to the government?s policies. The March on Washington in 1963 gathered at the Lincoln Memorial, where Martin Luther King Jr. famously quoted the words to ?My Country ?Tis of Thee,? repeating the phrase ?Let freedom ring? 11 times.</p>
<p>Phil Ochs, then part of a new generation of politically conscious singer-songwriters who emerged during the 1960s, wrote an anthem in the Guthrie vein, ?The Power and the Glory,? that coupled love of country with a strong plea for justice and equality. The words to the chorus echo the sentiments of the anti-Vietnam War movement:</p>
<p>Here is a land full of power and glory; Beauty that words cannot recall; Oh her power shall rest on the strength of her freedom; Her glory shall rest on us all.</p>
<p>One of its stanzas updated Guthrie?s combination of outrage and patriotism:</p>
<p>Yet she?s only as rich as the poorest of her poor; Only as free as the padlocked prison door; Only as strong as our love for this land; Only as tall as we stand.</p>
<p>This song later became part of the repertoire of the U.S. Army band.</p>
<p>And in 1968, in a famous anti-war speech, Norman Thomas, the aging leader of the Socialist Party, proclaimed, ?I come to cleanse the American flag, not burn it.?</p>
<p>In recent decades, Bruce Springsteen has most closely followed in the Guthrie tradition. From ?Born in the USA,? to his songs about Tom Joad (the militant protagonist in John Steinbeck?s&amp;#160;The Grapes of Wrath), to his anthem about the 9/11 tragedy (?Empty Sky?), to his album&amp;#160;Wrecking Ball&amp;#160;(including its opening song, ?We Take Care of Our Own?), Springsteen has championed the downtrodden while challenging America to live up to its ideals.</p>
<p>Steve (?Little Stevie?) Van Zandt is best known as the guitarist with Springsteen?s E Street Band and for his role as Silvio Dante, Tony Soprano?s sidekick on the TV show, ?The Sopranos.? But his most enduring legacy should be his love song about America, ?I Am a Patriot,? including these lyrics:</p>
<p>I am a patriot, and I love my country; Because my country is all I know. Wanna be with my family; People who understand me; I got no place else to go. And I ain?t no communist, And I ain?t no socialist, And I ain?t no capitalist, And I ain?t no imperialist, And I ain?t no Democrat, Sure ain?t no Republican either, I only know one party, And that is freedom.</p>
<p>Since the American Revolution, each generation of progressives has expressed an American patriotism rooted in democratic values that challenged jingoism and ?my country ? right or wrong? thinking. They rejected blind nationalism, militaristic drum beating and sheep-like conformism.</p>
<p>Throughout the United States? history, they have viewed their movements ? abolition of slavery, farmers? populism, women?s suffrage, workers? rights, civil rights, environmentalism, gay rights and others ? as profoundly patriotic. They believed that America?s core claims ? fairness, equality, freedom, justice ? were their own.</p>
<p>America now confronts a new version of the Gilded Age, brought upon by Wall Street greed and corporate malfeasance. In the midst of a recession, the gap between rich and poor is still widening. Although the economy has improved in recent years, Americans are feeling more economically insecure than at any time since the Depression. They are upset by the unbridled selfishness and political influence-peddling demonstrated by banks, oil companies, drug companies, insurance companies and other large corporations. They are angry at the growing power of American-based global firms who show no loyalty to their country, outsource jobs to low-wage countries, avoid paying taxes and pollute the environment.</p>
<p>Sam Walton, the founder of Walmart, America?s largest corporation, promoted the motto ?Buy American.? But today the retail giant, now owned by his heirs, imports most of its merchandise from Asia, much of it made under sweatshop conditions. (Ironically, most American flags are made in China.)</p>
<p>We are, once again, battling over immigration and who belongs in America. Some right-wing groups and talk-show pundits, calling themselves patriots, have even challenged the citizenship of our president.</p>
<p>These trends have triggered a growing grassroots movement ? reflected by Occupy Wall Street but involving a diverse coalition of community groups, immigrant rights organizations, unions, consumer advocates and human rights activists ? demanding stronger regulations to protect consumers, workers and the environment from abusive corporations, living wages, fairer trade and higher taxes on the very rich to pay for better schools, safer roads and student loans.</p>
<p>This movement, which embodies the idea of ?liberty and justice for all,? reflects America?s tradition of progressive patriotism. It recognizes that conservatives have never had a monopoly on Old Glory.</p>

<article id="0000340" published-at="2014-08-18" title="Florida Surrogates Go Nuclear"><p>Two&amp;#160;well-heeled surrogates of Gov. Rick Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist continue to pollute the Florida airwaves with misleading claims. This time they distort the facts of a state settlement last year with Duke Energy that will cost ratepayers $2.9 billion over 20 years.</p>
<p>The $2.9 billion is actually two pots of money: nearly $1.5 billion that will be charged to ratepayers for costs related to Duke?s decision last year to close the Crystal River nuclear plant, and $1.4 billion in so-called advance fees that were charged to ratepayers to build a new nuclear plant in Levy County (that was later canceled) and upgrade the existing Crystal River plant.</p>
<p>But <a href="" type="internal">NextGen Climate Action</a>, a liberal group backing Crist for governor, and the Republican Party of Florida, which backs Scott, inaccurately conflate the costs of the two projects and blame the entire amount on other guy:</p>
<p>NextGen?s ?Shocking? Claims</p>
<p>NextGen, the group financed by billionaire climate-change activist Tom Steyer, has jumped into the Florida governor?s race in a big way. And the Republican Party of Florida has leaped to Scott?s defense. <a href="" type="internal">We recently wrote</a> about a back-and-forth between the two groups over oil drilling near the Everglades.</p>
<p>This time, NextGen attacks the Republican governor for the state Public Service Commission?s decision on Oct. 17, 2013 to approve a $5 billion settlement with Duke Energy.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;iframe style="width: 500px; height:300px;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="https://video.factcheck.org/play/89b7dde588b"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;</p>
<p>The ad starts with a TV news reporter saying, ?We Floridians are paying billions of dollars to the nation?s largest power company and getting nothing in return.? The ad?s narrator then says, ?One defective power plant. Another never built. Florida Fleeced by Duke Energy. Rick Scott knew but he?s letting Duke keep collecting billions anyway.?</p>
<p>The ad then shows on the screen an excerpt from a Tampa Bay Times <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/energy/florida-psc-approves-duke-energy-agreement-with-customers-on-hook-for-32/2147708" type="external">news story on the settlement</a>: ?Duke?s customers on the hook for up to $3.2 billion.? (The $3.2 billion estimate proved to be too high, as we?ll explain later.)</p>
<p>We asked NextGen for information to support the claims in the ad. ?It was the Tampa Bay Times that said ?Duke?s customers on the hook for up to $3.2 billion,? and it was Rick Scott?s appointed Public Service Commission commissioners that voted for the settlement,? NextGen told us in a statement.</p>
<p>But it is not that simple. The facts show that decisions made by the last three administrations ? including Crist?s ? were responsible for a portion of the settlement, but no administration is responsible for all of it.</p>
<p>As we previously mentioned, there are two components of the settlement. Let?s first take the $1.4 billion in advance fees that Duke Energy (and its predecessor, Progress Energy) were allowed to charge its ratepayers for two simultaneous projects: construction of a new nuclear power plant in Levy County and repairs to the Crystal River plant.</p>
<p>Duke Energy this year <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/energy/duke-energy-to-cancel-proposed-levy-county-nuclear-plant-fasano-says/2134287" type="external">canceled the Levy plant project</a> and <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/energy/duke-energy-announces-closing-of-crystal-river-nuclear-power-plant/1273794" type="external">closed Crystal River</a> after repairs failed ? so the wasted money on these projects is a sore point with ratepayers, including the group ? <a href="http://stopdukeripoff.org/" type="external">Stop Duke Rip Off</a>.?</p>
<p>It was then-Gov. Jeb Bush who signed an <a href="http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/media/enews/2006/pdf/sbo888er.pdf" type="external">energy bill in 2006</a> that changed state policy to allow utility companies to charge advance fees to help finance nuclear projects (known as the nuclear cost recovery clause). <a href="http://votesmart.org/public-statement/184433/governor-bush-signs-historic-energy-legislation-launches-tampas-first-ethanol-production-facility#.U-udwGNAc1I" type="external">Bush issued a press release on June 19, 2006,</a> to announce he signed the bill, but it made no mention of this major change in financing nuclear plants or even nuclear energy for that matter.</p>
<p>Tampa Bay Times business columnist Robert Trigaux on Aug. 9, 2013, <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/energy/who-gets-credit-for-nuclear-advance-fee-law-one-of-worst-in-state-history/2135706" type="external">wrote a column</a> about the law headlined, ?Who gets credit for nuclear advance fee law, one of worst in state history?? Trigaux said the Legislature passed the law in a ?deceptive process,? quoting a state senator as saying ?[there] was no mention of prepay costs recovery on the Senate floor.? He spread the blame around. ?It?s tragic that in seven years, no Florida legislator, governor or member of the state Cabinet has summoned the public service spirit to repeal or even seriously amend this loser measure,? he wrote. (Both Crist and Scott amended the law, as we will discuss later, but neither repealed it.)</p>
<p>It was under this law that Progress Energy went to the Crist administration and proposed building a nuclear power plant in Levy County. Crist was governor of Florida from <a href="http://www.flheritage.com/kids/governor.cfm?id=52" type="external">Jan. 2, 2007, to Jan. 4, 2011</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/aug2009/2009-08-11-091.asp" type="external">On Aug. 11, 2009</a>, Crist and his Cabinet, in their roles as members of the <a href="http://www.dep.state.fl.us/siting/" type="external">Department of Environmental Protection?s siting board</a>, approved the project. The siting certificate, signed by Crist, was <a href="http://publicfiles.dep.state.fl.us/Siting/Outgoing/Web/Certification/pa08_51_2010_C.pdf" type="external">issued Aug. 26, 2009</a>. Crist was well aware that the law would allow Duke to charge ratepayers advance fees to pay for the plant. <a href="http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20090812/ARTICLE/908121037?p=3&amp;amp;tc=pg&amp;amp;tc=ar" type="external">In a story on the day Crist approved the plant</a>, the Herald-Tribune of Sarasota noted that Progress was seeking approval from the PSC to charge ratepayers for the Levy plant and quoted Crist as saying, ?I would encourage the company to keep the rates as low as possible.?</p>
<p>Progress Energy (and later Duke Energy after a <a href="http://www.duke-energy.com/corporate-merger/" type="external">2012 merger)</a> was able to go to the Public Service Commission to get approval for the advance fees as permitted under law ? a process that started under the Crist administration and continued under the Scott administration, according to <a href="http://www.psc.state.fl.us/library/FILINGS/13/01011-13/01011-13.pdf" type="external">Charles Rehwinkel</a>, a deputy counsel at the <a href="http://www.floridaopc.gov/" type="external">Office of Public Counsel</a>, which represents ratepayers in utility cases before the Public Service Commission.</p>
<p>?That amount did NOT emanate from the settlement,? Rehwinkel, referring to the $1.4 billion in advance fees, told us in an email. ?As part of the settlement, we took dollars that the Commission had already approved under the advanced recovery law and addressed how they would be recovered (over what timeframe and at what price point).?</p>
<p>In other words, the $1.4 billion in advance fees was already approved by the PSC under Crist and Scott for projects Crist and his administration approved. For NextGen to say Scott allowed Duke to ?keep collecting billions? ignores the arguably more important roles played by Bush and Crist in these failed projects.</p>
<p>(Rehwinkel told us the original $3.2 billion estimate included $1.8 billion in advance fees, but the company has provided updated information that puts the cost of the advance fees at $1.4 billion, reducing the total cost to ratepayers to $2.9 billion ? not $3.2 billion. He said the $1.4 billion in advance fees included $1 billion for the now-canceled Levy plant and $350 million for repairs to close the Crystal River plant.)</p>
<p>As for the cost of closing the Crystal River plant, Rehwinkel told us that state regulators were merely following standard regulatory procedures when charging ratepayers $1.466 billion ( <a href="http://www.psc.state.fl.us/library/filings/13/06894-13/06894-13.pdf" type="external">see page 3 of the settlement</a>) that allow utilities to recover expenses for plants that close but still have ongoing costs, such as debt payments and storage of spent nuclear fuel. He said the expected life of the plant was 40 years, but it was closed after 33 years.</p>
<p>So, although it happened on Scott?s watch, no governor is to blame for those costs.</p>
<p>One last thing about the NextGen ad. It implies that state regulators approved the settlement in exchange for $500,000 in campaign contributions that Scott received from Duke Energy and Progress Energy. We did find that <a href="http://election.dos.state.fl.us/committees/ComLkup.asp" type="external">the Progress Energy PAC</a> gave $500,000 in two contributions to Scott?s political action committee Let?s Get to Work on Nov. 18, 2013, and Dec. 31, 2013. But NextGen provides no evidence that those contributions influenced the decision-making process.</p>
<p>When we asked for evidence, NextGen?s statement merely noted that the contributions came weeks after the PSC approved the settlement, saying ?it?s up to Scott to answer for his campaign contributions.? That?s not how it works. The onus is on NextGen to back up a claim that, if true, would be a violation of law.</p>
<p>Republican Party of Florida Response</p>
<p>The state Republican Party responded with its own misleading ad.</p>
<p>&amp;lt;iframe style="width: 500px; height:300px;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="https://video.factcheck.org/play/8636748864a"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;</p>
<p>The ad, called ?Crist?s Giveaway,? replays the first 10 seconds of the NextGen ad. It, too, opens with a TV news reporter saying, ?We Floridians are paying billions of dollars to the nation?s largest power company and getting nothing in return.? The ad?s narrator then says, ?One defective power plant. Another never built.?</p>
<p>It then interrupts the NextGen narrative with these words: ?Charlie Crist let it happen when he was governor. Crist made it easier for Duke Energy to take your money. Crist signed a law helping Duke get billions, while Rick Scott put a stop to the Crist giveaway.?</p>
<p>The Republican Party says in its backup documents that Crist approved the Levy project ? which is absolutely correct, as we noted earlier. That much is accurate. But, as we also noted, Progress and Duke charged ratepayers advance fees based on a law signed by Bush.</p>
<p>So, how did Duke Energy make it easier to ?take your money? and what law did he sign that helped Duke ?get billions? of dollars? The only support for that is a bill that Crist signed ? <a href="http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=39607" type="external">HB 7135</a> ? that amended the 2006 law signed by Bush. HB 7135 allowed related transmission costs to be included in the advance fees charged to ratepayers.</p>
<p>The only problem: The bill Crist signed had very little impact on the $2.9 billion settlement with Duke. The amount is in the tens of millions, not at all in the billions, Rehwinkel told us in an email. ?I can unequivocally say that the HB 7135 transmission amendment did not impose billions of dollars of costs on customers in the form of advanced recovery as it turned out,? he said.</p>
<p>When we asked for an accounting of the billions of dollars mentioned in the ad, <a href="http://www.rpof.org/staff/susan-hepworth/" type="external">RPOF spokeswoman Susan Hepworth</a> responded with an email that said: ?Our ad makes ZERO reference to the settlement. We only refer to the law which Charlie Crist expanded that put taxpayers on the hook for the failed power plants.?</p>
<p>It?s just not accurate to say the Republican ad makes ?zero reference? to the settlement. The ad clearly makes a reference to the settlement by showing a full third of the NextGen ad, which was all about the settlement. The narrator in the Republican ad even reads from the same script when she says, ?One defective power plant. Another never built.? That?s a clear reference to Duke Energy?s two failed nuclear projects ? the defective Crystal River plant that was closed and the Levy plant that was never built.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Republicans still did not provide any evidence that the law Crist signed helped Duke ?get billions.?</p>
<p>The ad also says that ?Rick Scott put a stop to the Crist giveaway.? It is true that Scott last year signed into law <a href="http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=50560" type="external">SB 1472</a>, which amended the 2006 law signed by Bush. The law Scott signed requires utilities to begin construction within 10 years of obtaining a license in order to continuing charging the advance fee. Rehwinkel said the bill Scott signed forced Duke to cancel the Levy project and ?stopped the bleeding.?</p>
<p>But Scott did not repeal the advance fee, which critics of the law wanted. The Tampa Bay Times editorial board called the changes to the law ? <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/editorials/editorial-its-scott-against-the-consumer/2126762" type="external">tepid</a>.? It said the bill didn?t go far enough and the law should have been repealed. The <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/energy/critics-hail-modest-reforms-to-nuclear-advance-fee-law/2127170" type="external">Southern Alliance for Clean Energy called the new law</a> an ?important step? but a ?modest bill.?</p>
<p>There is plenty of blame to go around in this saga of the Progress Energy/Duke Energy nuclear plants. But the ads by both sides are simplistic and misleading when they point the finger in only one direction.</p>

<p>?From Ballad of Accounting, words and music by Ewan MacColl</p>
<p>Suddenly jobs are on the political agenda. Politicians from the President on down state that creating jobs for American workers is their top priority. Often any jobs, as with the low-wage jobs that Texas Governor Rick Perry brags he ?created.? Sometimes they want to create ?good paying? jobs. But in this discourse having a job is everything, because it allows one to pay the bills and avoid poverty.</p>
<p>Those who worked with Jean Alonso making missiles in a Massachusetts defense plant ? referred to as American Missile and Communications Corporation but sounding suspiciously like Massachusetts-based Raytheon ? knew how important it was to have a job in this society. But they also recognized that ?good jobs? should mean far more than good-paying ones. And they knew, from their own bitter experience, that many jobs can be toxic, destroying the mind and soul, and sometimes the body as well of those who work them.</p>
<p>Alonso?s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1463538812/counterpunchmaga" type="external">The Patriots: An Inside Look at Life in a Defense Plant</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1463538812/counterpunchmaga" type="external">&amp;#160;</a> begins as the missiles fly at the start of the first Gulf War. The fragile community in the plant is strained by tensions between the patriotic workers and Alonso with her antiwar views and activities. Alonso copes with her own anguish by conducting an informal survey of how her coworkers feel about their work. She learns that these coworkers are filled with a profound sense of hopelessness and despair:</p>
<p>?I feel like a zero.?</p>
<p>?Inferior.?</p>
<p>?Empty.?</p>
<p>?Helpless.?</p>
<p>?I?m very depressed and anxious.?</p>
<p>?I?m so unhappy here I get aches and pains from it.?</p>
<p>?Apathetic. I can?t do anything at home anymore but watch TV.?</p>
<p>?I was a musician, you know, so I still need to write everyday ? if you don?t you have no soul. But I go home and I?m too tired.?</p>
<p>?I feel like there?s something crushed inside ? I feel really defeated. It?s like giving up on your whole self in order to make a living ? you can?t figure a way out.? (pp. 10-11).</p>
<p>These responses, expressing feelings that had never been spoken among these workers, start Alonso and a small group of coworkers on a journey to make sense of what was happening to them at work and why. Through monthly meetings buttressed by Alonso?s library research, they explore the deadening effects of repetitive work accompanied by social powerlessness in the workplace. They try to understand Alonso?s realization that ?something in this work is changing us, as if we were living by Love Canal? (p. 37).</p>
<p>Over the next couple of years this group of defense plant workers examine their dashed hopes and dreams as well as an extensive body of social science literature, in an attempt to figure out just how the work was changing them. They confessed to each other that their ability to reason had diminished after years in the plant. The lack of mental stimulation was reducing their very intelligence. And, indeed, as Alonso learned from her reading, a German researcher had found that IQ declines following years of unskilled labor. This cognitive decline didn?t seem so surprising to the workers when one of them recalled being told by a supervisor, ?You don?t get paid to think.? These workers discovered through their own experience that mindless work induces mindlessness.</p>
<p>Alonso later realized that the experience of the American Missile workers wouldn?t have seemed strange to Adam Smith, who in 1776 wrote of the mind-destroying effects of unskilled work as an unfortunate but inevitable consequence of the then new industrial system:</p>
<p>The understanding of the greater part of men is necessarily formed by their ordinary employments. The man?s whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations and he naturally loses, therefore, the habit [of solving problems] and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become? But in every improved and civilized society this is the state into which the laboring poor, that is, the great body of the people, must necessarily fall (p. 180).</p>
<p>In addition to cognitive problems, the plant workers confronted elevated depression, anxiety, and apathy. Alonso?s research convinced her that these symptoms were similar to those experienced by victims of what psychologist Judith Herman called ?complex chronic post-traumatic stress syndrome? or CCPTSD. She quotes Herman as saying that those suffering from CCPTSD ?have a history of subjection to totalitarian control over a prolonged period of time? (p. 125).</p>
<p>The shop floor environment that Alonso and her fellow workers experienced daily was, indeed, totalitarian. Every motion was monitored. Bathroom breaks were strictly regulated.&amp;#160; Supervisors yelled at workers as if they were disobedient children. Conversations were monitored and often forbidden. Escape, while not impossible, became ever more difficult as years in the plant went by and economic chains bound the workers.</p>
<p>In her efforts to better understand the totalitarian aspects of her work environment, Alonso studied military culture and found many similarities to the culture at American Missile. The similarities were not accidental. She realized that the company deliberately sought out supervisors with military backgrounds. The fact that the company was part of the military-industrial complex, producing missiles for US wars, probably made military culture especially desirable to management.</p>
<p>At the time that Alonso writes about, relations between workers in the plant were especially stressed as many of the workers sought a sense of meaning and community through patriotic identification with the company?s missile-producing mission and with the war in progress and became less tolerant of those questioning the war. Pressure to not rock the boat increased as demand for the missiles rose.</p>
<p>Like many manufacturing companies, American Missile had a union. Unfortunately, this was as much a part of the problem as part of the solution. Union officials refused to pursue cases of sexual abuse, wouldn?t recognize the women?s committee founded by Alonso and others, and systematically harassed militants. Thus, much of the energy to improve the workplace was channeled into often futile attempts at union reform.</p>
<p>Throughout The Patriots: An Inside Look at Life in a Defense Plant Alonso weaves her personal account of nearly two decades in the factory with an account of the research into the effects of the work environment on workers. The result is one of the most thought provoking books you will find to read this year. As the politicians talk endlessly about ?jobs? while providing few, Alonso reminds us that a good society will provide not just jobs, or even well-paying jobs, but jobs that enhance the spirit and development of those who work them.</p>
<p>Surely today, 235 years after Adam Smith described the mind-destroying nature of unskilled work, an ?improved and civilized society,? ? as Smith described the new industrial capitalism ? should be one that proves him wrong. Such a society would be one in which all who work find that their jobs enhance their thinking, spirit, and sense of humanity. Such a society would be one in which workers are not merely the tools of the already wealthy and powerful, but makers of a more decent world for themselves, their fellow workers, and the rest of society. While the politicians beholden to the powerful are not likely to be concerned with this goal, surely the vast majority of us ought to be.</p>
<p>What did you learn in the morning? How much did you know in the afternoon? Were you content in the evening? Did they teach you how to question when you were at the school? Did the factory help you grow, were you the maker or the tool? Did the place where you were living Enrich your life and then Did you reach some understanding of all your fellow men, all your fellow men, all your fellow men?</p>

<article id="0000342" published-at="2018-07-14" title="Gerard Depardieu After Receiving Russian Citizenship: I Love Putin!"><p>Newly minted <a href="/content/dailybeast/cheats/2013/01/03/depardieu-given-russian-citizenship.html" type="external">Russian citizen Gerard Depardieu</a> didn?t wait long to glorify his new homeland and President Vladimir Putin. Less than 24 hours after the Russian leader granted him citizenship, the actor promised to learn Russian and settle down in Moscow?s suburbs, and confessed to loving Russia, Russian literature, and Putin.</p>
<p>Indeed, it seems the first Russian word Depardieu? <a href="/content/dailybeast/articles/2012/12/31/the-return-of-gerard-depardieu.html" type="external">who is leaving France, reportedly to avoid high taxes</a>?learned was slava, or ?glory.? ?Slava Chechnya! Slava Kadyrov!? the French actor told a birthday celebration for Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov in Grozny last October. To the frustration of Russian liberals, Depardieu, 64, failed to meet with any ordinary Chechens to discuss human-rights issues during his visit to the war-torn region. Nor did he make himself available to any independent reporters in Moscow on Friday; instead, he wrote an open letter addressed to a pro-Kremlin state television channel. The actor noted that Russia had ?a great democracy.?</p>
<p>Russian-language websites were rife with negative speculation about the real reasons the French star was praising Russia. On LiveJournal, bloggers wondered what price the Kremlin had to pay to persuade Depardieu to ?love Putin?s terror, which has turned millions of Russian lives into hell.? On Facebook, there was a discussion about who in the Kremlin would get to share the tax money that Depardieu would save by escaping to Russia. Another Russian word the actor might learn, the commenters proposed, was raspilit, or "kickback." Others suggested that Putin?s newly arrived friend might first try to live in Siberia, take public transport wearing a fur coat, and stick Band-Aids to the soles of his shoes to avoid slipping on the icy sidewalks.</p>
<p>The citizenship offer is yet another Kremlin attempt to show the world, ?Look, this one is with us!? said the satirist and journalist Victor Shenderovich said. Speaking on the radio station Echo of Moscow, Shenderovich said bitterly of Depardieu: ?He became a Russian citizen to replace the 3 million Russians who have escaped Russia in the Putin era.?</p>
<p>Following in Depardieu?s footsteps, French actress turned animal-rights activist Brigitte Bardot on Friday threatened to apply for Russian citizenship if two circus elephants in southern France are euthanized. In response, the Russian opposition activist Olga Kurnosova posted an open letter on Facebook explaining to Bardot that Putin granted Depardieu citizenship purely for public-relations reasons ?that were profitable for the current Russian government.?</p>
<p>Official Moscow hailed the arrival of the French actor as the biggest news of the week. Kremlin officials complimented Depardieu on his leading role in a Franco-Russian film about Rasputin??It is a very bold and innovative interpretation of the character,? said Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov?and on his upcoming portrayal of another Russian hero, the pre-Revolutionary rebel Pugachev. Meanwhile, higher-ranking officials spoke proudly of potential opportunities for tax dodgers. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin declared that, when the world sees what Russia has to offer, there will be ?a massive migration of rich Europeans to Russia.?</p>
<p>But to many Russian intellectuals, Depardieu?s escape to Moscow looks absurd. ?Go to Volokalamsk or Magnitogorsk, where people are wondering how to survive from pension check to pension check or how to fix their leaky roof,? said Leonid Heifetz, a Moscow theater director and professor at the Russian University of Theater. ?The entire story is laughable and has zero significance for the everyday lives of Russian people.?</p></article>

Book Derailed"><p>A plan to make the Bible the official state book in Tennessee derailed Thursday when the Republican-controlled Senate sent the measure back to a committee, effectively killing it this year.</p>
<p>The bill has divided Republicans in conservative Tennessee. Some say the Bible is far too sacred to be deemed an "official state book." Conversely, others believe it's an integral part of the state's history.</p>
<p>Tennessee's attorney general, Herbert Slatery, warned in a legal opinion earlier this week that the bill would violate separation of church and state provisions of both the federal and state constitutions. Similar worries about proposals in Mississippi and Louisiana caused lawmakers there to drop measures in recent years.</p>
<p>Still, the GOP-controlled Tennessee House approved the bill 55-38 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Mark Norris, one of the state's most powerful legislators, said Thursday the constitutional concerns were the main reason for sending the bill back to the Senate Judiciary Committee, which could take up the bill next year.</p>
<p>"We debated it, but never talked about the legal issues," he said. "The attorney general's opinion raises legal issues that were not discussed."</p>
<p>Tennessee's official state symbols include the tomato as the state fruit, the tulip poplar as the state tree, the Tennessee cave salamander as the state amphibian and the square dance as the state folk dance. The state also has several state songs such as "Tennessee Waltz" and "Rocky Top." All are listed in the Tennessee Blue Book, considered the definitive almanac of Tennessee state government.</p>
<p>Opponents of the legislation raised concerns about putting the Bible on par with such innocuous state symbols.</p></article>
<article id="0000344" published-at="2012-03-23" title="VIDEO: U.S. Army sergeant expected to face 17 murder charges for Afghan massacre"><p>Robert Bales, the U.S. Army staff sergeant accused of killing 16 Afghan civilians in a massacre more than a week ago, is expected to be charged Friday with 17 counts of murder, as well as additional charges at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., according to various media reports.</p>
<p>Bales is accused of walking away from his base to an Afghan village and shooting and stabbing to death several families, including nine children.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>John Henry Browne, the lead attorney for the accused soldier, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/us/us-sergeant-facing-murder-charges-over-afghan-killing.html?hp" type="external">told The New York Times</a> he was unsurprised by the charges and unconvinced by the facts.</p>
<p>?There?s definitely brain injury, no question about it,? Browne told the Times. "There?s no crime scene. There?s no DNA. There?s no confession, although they?re leaking something, which I don?t believe until I see it. This is going to be a hard case for the government to prove. And my client can?t help me a lot with some of the things because he has mental problems and I believe they?re totally legitimate."</p>
<p>Bales, in a trial that could stretch for years over a series of hearings, could face the death penalty if convicted. There are currently six soldiers and airmen on the U.S. military's death row.</p>
<p>According to the BBC, it's not yet clear why Bales is set to face 17 murder charges. NATO and U.S. officials had previously set the death toll in the attack at 16, though some have cautioned it could actually be higher.</p>
<p>The Taliban criticized the proceedings, saying they have no faith in any trial.</p>
<p>"This was a planned activity and we will certainly take revenge on all American forces in Afghanistan and don't trust such trials," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17484186" type="external">according to the BBC.</a></p></article>

<p>The fallout from the firing of FBI director James Comey goes well beyond politics and Americans may bear the brunt in costs and safety, according to former RNC Chairman Haley Barbour.</p>

<p>?I can?t quantify it from the federal government but it does cost [taxpayers],? he said during an interview on the FOX Business Network. ?It also presents the cost of taking FBI agents off other matters, criminal matters,? he cautioned.</p>
<p>Barbour also said American?s should hone-in on the memo written by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein?a career Department of Justice attorney appointed by the Obama Administration, who advised President Trump on Comey.</p>
<p>?I haven?t seen the memo, but I assume it?s because Comey usurped the power of the attorney general when he said that the FBI and he had decided that there would be no prosecution of Hillary Clinton,? he said. &amp;#160;?The FBI doesn?t have any authority to decide who ought to be prosecuted and not. Their job is to recommend to the attorney general.?</p>
<p>Comey, who was leading a 10-month investigation into the alleged Trump campaign-Russia collusion, carries major implications, according to Barbour.</p>
<p>While we still don?t know what urged President Trump to fire the FBI director, in his letter to Comey, President Trump mentioned he was informed that he was not under investigation.</p>

<article id="0000358" published-at="2016-04-09" title="Are Retail Stores Really Benefiting From Low Gas Prices?"><p></p>
<p>Image source: Nicholas Rossolillo.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>Americans have been enjoying lower gas prices for the last year. That extra savings at the gas pump adds up when you consider the millions of drivers across the country. But where is all of that extra cash going? Is any of it translating into sales and profits for businesses?</p>
<p>Let's start with a side-by-side comparison of gas prices and consumer spending in the past few years. Here's a chart illustrating the trend:</p>
<p>Data source: US Energy Information Administration and Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.</p>
<p>Average gas prices stayed above $3 a gallon until 2014. Since then, gas prices have dropped to roughly half that amount. The average American has been increasing spending on everything from electronics and household goods to eating out. That uptrend really accelerated in mid-2014, as gas prices started to fall. For the past year and a half, Americans have been spending an average of 3% more every month than they did a year ago.</p>
<p>As we can see from the data, Americans are spending a little extra of that money saved at the pump. What has the impact been on retail business specifically?</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Let's consider three retailers to see how they've been faring over the past three years.</p>
<p>Full-year revenue</p>
<p>Sources: Best Buy, Big Lots, and Target annual financial results. All companies' fiscal years end on thelast business day of January. Best Buy's last reported fiscal year was 2016, ended Jan. 30, 2016. Big Lots and Target last fiscal year was 2015, ended Jan. 30, 2016.</p>
<p>Even though Americans are spending more money every year, revenue growth for many retail companies, especially traditional brick-and-mortar retail chains, has been tepid. As far as the companies listed goes, Best Buy has seen drops in revenue over the past three years, Big Lots is flat, and Target is up slightly.</p>
<p>It's been a tough environment for retail. Although Americans are increasing their spending on non-essentials, that spending has been directed more toward eating out (up 7.7% year over year in 2015) and e-commerce purchases (up 6.2% year over year in 2015) than it has been toward general retail in an in-store format.</p>
<p>What happens when gas goes back up?So what would happen if gas prices go back to $3 a gallon or higher? This will eventually happen, and in recent weeks, we've seen gasoline creep back over $2 again. While we've seen consumer spending increase in general over the past year, traditional retail business hasn't experienced as big a boost as other types of business. That extra disposable income generated from low gas prices seems to be irrelevant for a typical retailer, so it may stand to reason that an increase in gas prices would also not affect retail.</p>
<p>Instead, spending gains seen in other consumer categories, such as restaurants and e-commerce, would probably be affected by an increase in gasoline before general retail. To summarize, low energy costs really don't help the traditional brick-and-mortar retail business all that much. Investors concerned with benefiting from the drop, and looking to avoid a hit when gas prices go back up, should look elsewhere.</p>

<article id="0000365" published-at="2016-04-11" title="Central bank money waterfall misses mark"><p>At this point in the economic cycle, the zero interest rate policies (ZIRP) are arguably doing more harm than good.</p>
<p>Global central banks, by pushing interest rates to artificially low levels around the world, are inadvertently causing deflation in my opinion.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>That?s exactly the situation that central banks have been trying to avoid.</p>
<p>The torrent of low interest rate capital is flooding markets with liquidity and the money is being put to work at ever lower rates of return.</p>
<p>Specifically, corporations invest in projects with lower internal rates of return and banks and other asset managers make investments in assets with lower expected rates of return.</p>
<p>The result has been higher asset prices and lower rates of expected future returns.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>In the manufacturing sector, more and more goods are being produced with low interest capital. As a result, prices of manufactured goods continue to deflate.</p>
<p>The effects of ZIRP are apparent in commodities where the low cost of capital lead to massive overproduction and price deflation.</p>
<p>There are many more examples, however, the key point is that low interest rates distort world markets.</p>
<p>In my opinion, interest rate normalization is critical to the long term realization of global central banks? inflation goals and investors expected returns.</p>

<article id="0000366" published-at="2005-06-18" title="Star Wars or Earth Wars?"><p>The Revenge of the Sith, the sixth movie in the Star Wars saga, is drawing record crowds and grossing millions by the week. George Lucas, heady with the success of American Graffiti in 1973, conceived the series two years later. It was to be the story of Anakin Skywalker?s rise, fall and ultimate redemption. Since the story was too large for one film, he divided it into two trilogies and decided (for reasons best known to him) to make the second trilogy before the first one.</p>
<p>He offered the science fiction concept to Universal Studios, who had produced American Graffiti. In a decision they would regret badly in the years to come, Universal passed on it because they dismissed the story as ?unfathomable and silly.? In fact, every single studio in Hollywood passed on it except for 20th Century Fox.</p>
<p>The first film in the series was released in 1977. By the end of its first theatrical run, it had become the most successful in the history of cinema and turned Lucas into a multi-millionaire. In the decades to come, the Star Wars brand would acquire a cult following equally among the young and the old. Some would be drawn to it because of the lure of space travel. Others would love the stunning special effects that became its hallmark. And many would love its portrayal of war between good and evil. Located in a ?galaxy far, far away,? war seemed glorious.</p>
<p>However, it you strip the exotic location and the stunning special effects, the film is a gripping portrayal of the arrogance, anger and hostility that drive people to make war on planet Earth. By not calling it ?Earth Wars,? Lucas ensured that millions of people seeking to escape the real wars going on around them would become moviegoers.</p>
<p>Addressing the Asian defense ministers in Singapore earlier this month, an indignant US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld asked why China was increasing its defense spending in consecutive years by double-digit percentages since it faced no immediate threats. He said such high spending rates could destabilize the Asian military balance. One may, of course, ask the same question of Rumsfeld. The only known enemies of the US are non-state actors that hardly justify the type and level of military spending that it is engaged in.</p>
<p>While accounting for only 5 percent of the world?s population, the US accounts for half of global defense spending, according to figures released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. For the first time since the end of the Cold War, global military spending topped a trillion dollars last year. This amounts to 2.6 percent of the world?s gross domestic product and represents an expenditure of $162 for every man, woman and child on the planet.</p>
<p>In addition to spending $500 billion annually on its military, the US has allocated $238 billion to prosecute the global war on terror since 2003. As Jeffrey Sachs of the Earth Institute argues in his new book, ?The End Of Poverty,? the US has unfortunately neglected the deeper causes of global instability that lead to terror. Its spending on extremely poor people who live on a daily income of less than a dollar a day is about 3 percent of its defense budget. These people are chronically hungry, ill, and uneducated. They lack basic housing and clothing. Today, there are 1.1 billion such people in the globe, all in danger of being killed by poverty.</p>
<p>Yet a callous world continues to increase military spending. No where is this more evident than in South Asia, where defense spending grew by 14 percent last year, compared to a global average growth rate of 5 percent.</p>
<p>While always arguing that it is not engaged in an arms race with India, Pakistan has just raised its defense spending by 16 percent to $3.8 billion. The saving grace is that in the same budget, the government has announced it will raise infrastructure development spending by almost 35 percent to $4.6 billion. Higher economic growth rates in the 6 to 8 percent range have made it possible to raise spending on both defense and development. However, this should not be taken to mean that there is no trade-off between spending on development and defense. If there is any ironclad law in economics, it is that there is no free lunch.</p>
<p>Peace economist Kanta Marwah and Nobel laureate Lawrence Klein have published an analysis of the impact of defense spending on economic growth, drawing upon data from five Latin American countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Peru. During the 1970s and 1980s, these countries spent on average 3.3 percent of their GDP on defense, which translated into an annual military expenditure of $7.4 billion (measured in 1990 US dollars). Marwah and Klein quantify the ?hidden cost? of defense spending during this period, by assessing how much it lowered the rate of economic growth.</p>
<p>Applying econometric methods to annual data over the 1970-91 time frame, they find that military spending had a negative impact on economic growth in all five countries. The worst affected country was Paraguay and the least affected was Bolivia. To determine the impact of the defense burden, they simulated what would have happened had the burden been reduced to 1 percent of GDP, emulating the spending cap set by the Central American nation of Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Marwah and Klein find that high military spending caused Argentina to lose nearly 2 percentage points in its annual economic growth rate during the 1976-81 period. It was during this time that the generals in Argentina waged a ?dirty war? after having overthrown the civilian government of Isabel Peron.</p>
<p>Similarly, Chile lost annually 1 to 1.5 percentage points in its economic growth rate between 1974 to 1988, when the military government of August Pinochet held sway, after having overthrown the government of Salvadore Allende. For the five countries collectively, excessive military spending took off 1.5 percentage points of the annual rate of economic growth.</p>
<p>The findings of this exercise in revisionist history are very revealing and worth pondering over by governments in all developing countries who are seeking a brighter future for their citizens. In particular, they should be of interest to the leaders of South Asia, which is home to a third of the world?s poor.</p>
<p>Pakistan and India need to take the lead in reducing the defense burden on their populations, especially now that their longstanding tensions seem to be dissipating. Capping (and eventually reducing) military spending would be the ultimate confidence building measure on the road to peace.</p>

<article id="0000373" published-at="2013-10-29" title="Taxpayer funding for ?climate change? twice that of border security"><p>The liberal phantom menace of global warming gets more than twice as much federal money as cracking down on the very real menace of failing to secure the United States? borders, the Daily Caller reported Tuesday.</p>
<p>According <a href="" type="external">to a White House report</a>, combined federal spending among cabinet departments to combat ?climate change? was almost $22.2 billion, with $21.4 billion planned for next year.</p>
<p><a href="" type="internal"></a>That compares to about the Department of Homeland Security?s proposed 2014 budget, which includes spending about $12 billion on customs and border enforcement, <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/28/global-warming-gets-nearly-twice-as-much-taxpayer-money-as-border-security/" type="external">the Daily caller reported</a>.</p>
<p>Republicans on the House Energy and Science Committee want to know where all that global warming money is going.</p>
<p>?With billions of dollars currently being spent annually on climate change activities, Congress and the public should understand the scope of what the federal government is doing, how the billions of dollars are being spent, and what it will accomplish,? U.S. Rep. Ed Whitfield, R-Ky., told the Daily Caller.</p>
<p>?Anyone who believes the committee ought to be focusing its attention on climate change related issues should be standing with us to get these answers.?</p>
<p>Democrats, of course, insist they already know the answers ? the only answers that matter anyway. Because in contradiction to hundreds of years of the scientific method, the fountainhead of world progress since the Enlightenment, they insist the ?science is settled,? that the conversation?s over. (For an excellent take on ?settled science,? check out this National Review Online <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/human-exceptionalism/356844/settled-science-claim-not-scientific-wesley-j-smith" type="external">piece from Wesley J. Smith</a>. )</p>
<p>?We have turned a corner on that issue,? Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said last week in a speech to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ?We are ? including in our Congress ? really past the issue of whether we need to respond.?</p>
<p>That?s hogwash. Former Vice President Al Gore?s endless bloviating notwithstanding, respectable, critical thinkers ? whose snout isn?t buried in the public trough of grant money funding ?climate change? research ? who are skeptical of the whole theology <a href="" type="external">are surprisingly easy to find</a> if you look outside the pages of The New York Times and its fellow-traveling brethren.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, combating the actual fact of border insecurity, in a nation hated by terrorists the world over and already harboring an estimate 11 million people here illegally, is set to get half the money ?climate change? fighting gets.</p>
<p>It?s classic liberal thinking: Exactly the wrong priority, exactly the opposite response, to what reality dictates.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for libs, and to paraphrase John Adams, reality is a stubborn thing.</p>
<p>That would be unfortunate for the rest of us, too.</p>

<p>When the Rev. Bryan Kuchar was on trial last week on charges of molesting a child, the jury was sent out to decide all at once whether he was guilty and what his punishment should be if he was. As it turned out, the jury could not reach a decision on guilt, so the Roman Catholic priest will be tried again. When he is, the decision-making process will be significantly different if Gov. Bob Holden signs - as expected - an omnibus crime bill sent to him by the Legislature. It would split the deliberations so a jury would decide first on guilt. If jurors vote to convict, they then would hear evidence and lawyers' arguments about the proper penalty before retiring again to decide punishment.</p></article>

<article id="0000380" published-at="2016-06-06" title="Grover Norquist Trusts Trump's Tax Plan: 'It's Written Down'"><p>Sometimes we at Crooks and Liars have trouble writing up a video.</p>
<p>This is one of those times. Maybe it's because we've already done over 400 posts about Grover Norquist.</p>
<p>Maybe it's because <a href="" type="internal">he was completely discredited</a> by Samantha Bee on The Daily Show (in 2012, mind you) as an overgrown 8th grader, and that should be the end of his "Tax Pledge" for all eternity.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's just that Grover Norquist has been the same smarmy 'tax cuts for billionaires' douchebag for so very long that we are not only tired of his failed ideology, we're to the point where any Grover Norquist video makes all of us want to punch a wall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In any event, here he is, saying what Grover Norquist says, and being called out quite brilliantly as usual by the higher-tolerance-for-this-sh*t-than-we-have Paul Krugman.</p>
<p>Special kudos to Krugman for making Norquist admit that there actually was a Republican President between Saint Ronald Reagan and now. If you listened to Grover you'd think history's only Republican economy was St. Ronnie and his 4% growth recovery (which, by the way, was spurred by GOVERNMENT SPENDING and TAX INCREASES, but I digress).</p>
<p>Krugman also boils down the whole argument in just a few sentences:</p>
<p>KRUGMAN: I think the point is we actually know extremely well what to do. We know exactly what is needed and the problem is the people -- the ideology that Grover is giving here is what stands in the way. The fact that you'll have complete rigid adherence to that ideology, which has failed again and again and again, but nothing has changed, nothing has been learned from experience.</p>
<p>NORQUIST: Look at Reagan and Obama, and Reagan created more jobs and Reagan...</p>
<p>KRUGMAN: They've got to go back 35 years to a completely different situation. We had Bush, got all this stuff, none of it delivered. And it's kind of an amazing thing how Bush has become a nonperson.</p>
<p>But the money quote from this video appears at the 5:00 mark, where Grover says he really likes Trump's tax plan of reducing corporate taxes to 15%.</p>
<p>This is the drowning government in the bathtub dream for Grover. But again, the money quote:</p>
<p>KRUGMAN: Trump is completely incoherent on economic policy. I mean, you can find him on any given day supporting almost anything.</p>
<p>Well, he said he wanted to -- maybe he wanted to raise taxes on the rich, then he said he wanted to cut them. I mean, to actually try to suss out what Trump means, God knows.</p>
<p>NORQUIST: It's written down. And I think the proposal that he has -- getting rid of the death tax, getting rid of the AMT finally, taking the corporate and business takes to 15 percent...</p>
<p>He trusts Trump to stick to an imaginary 15% rate because It's. On. Paper.</p>
<p>Apparently Norquist was in a coma last month when <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2016/05/05/3775761/trump-tax-plan-reversal" type="external">Trump said all of his tax proposals would be subject to "negotiation."</a></p>
<p>Listen, Grover, even Trump doesn't trust Trump on taxes. Who is paying you to do so?</p></article>
<article id="0000381" published-at="2017-10-11" title="NFL Fires Back After Trump Tweets About Commissioner Forcing Athletes To Stand"><p>On Wednesday, the president continued his ongoing feud with the NFL. He has taken it up as a pet cause of his to try and compel players who choose to take a knee during the anthem as a protest on behalf of African Americans to cease their protesting.</p>
<p>In apparent response to reports about the NFL?s consideration of a rule compelling players to stand during the anthem ? and thus stem the tide of distracting criticism produced by what?s turned into a PR debacle thanks to the president?s goading ? Trump took to Twitter Wednesday to praise NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for ?demanding? that all players stand for the pre-game anthem.</p>
<p>There is just one problem ? according to the NFL, Trump got Goodell?s position dead wrong.</p>
<p>A statement from the NFL, posted to Twitter by sports journalist Ian Rapoport, reads:</p>
<p>?Commentary thus morning about the NFL Commissioner?s position on the anthem is not accurate. As we said yesterday, there will be a discussion of these issues at the owners meeting next week. The NFL is doing the hard work of trying to move from protest to progress, working to bring people together.?</p>
<p>Considering this statement from the NFL, Trump has yet again jumped ahead of the truth for the sake of his talking points.</p>
<p>The statement from the NFL responding to Trump?s tweet details Goodell?s efforts to be privy to the concerns of players and potential ways to address those concerns. He reportedly spent Tuesday with the Miami Dolphins, ?witnessing first hand the outstanding work our players and clubs are doing to strengthen our communities.?</p>
<p>Considering Goodell?s past statements, he seems to be of the personal persuasion that all should stand for the anthem, but he is, apparently, among those who do not want to force their position on others.</p>
<p>He is most certainly aware and concerned about, as mentioned, the hold that the controversy surrounding the anthem has put on efforts to address the underlying issues at play. Rather than allowing for a general conversation to proceed, the controversy, fueled in no small part by the president?s persistent belligerence, threatens to divide the league and its fans into ever more intense factions ? and that?s not good for business.</p>

<article id="0000382" title="A recipe for blended worship"><p>By Bob Burroughs</p>
<p>I prefer to call the ?worship wars? by another name: ?worship preferences.?</p>
<p>This, to me, better describes the situation in the vast majority of churches in our country today. We are really not at ?war? over worship style. It is a matter of personal preference.</p>
<p>If I am used to and comfortable with traditional worship, for instance, no one can convince me that contemporary will meet my worship needs. If I am used to and comfortable with contemporary worship, there is no way under heaven to convince me that traditional services are for me.</p>
<p>Some churches have succeeded with a ?blended? worship, but it has to be done very carefully, gently, over a period of time and, most importantly, with good leadership, planning and execution.</p>
<p>The typical ?blended? mix is done by using the 3/4 ? 1/4 model. In the ?traditional? church 3/4 of the service is traditional and 1/4 is contemporary. This means singing the familiar hymns with perhaps rhythm and keyboard upping the tempo and perhaps changing meter. ?Contemporary? churches reverse the formula.</p>
<p>The keys to success are knowing up front that a change of worship style will not bring packs of unchurched people or fringe members into the fold, and careful and involved planning to make sure the introduction of blended worship is met with a positive attitude.</p>
<p>This means the planning process must include church members who are involved from the beginning, and not just the ones who ?go along? with the staff on all decisions. Include a wide variety of folks ? teens, 20s, 30s, etc., and reach the gamut of your people.</p>
<p>The absolute key to success working into a blended service is the right leadership team. Not everyone can lead worship. One may play the guitar and sing well, but leading God?s people requires much more than that ? including some experience.</p>
<p>Here is the order of selection for the blended worship leadership team.</p>
<p>1. Knowledgeable leader. This is obvious but often overlooked. It can, but need not, be the minister of music.</p>
<p>Find someone with good guitar or keyboard skills, or both, who is comfortable on the microphone without overpowering the congregation. Don?t just choose someone you think might be good. Audition people.</p>
<p>This person should have a concept of worship leadership ? that he/she is not performing but leading God?s people and prepares a well-rounded service that is comfortable first to the committee and then to the people. &amp;#160;</p>
<p>This person will cost some extra funding. Never expect people to give their talent free with this much responsibility.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>2. Drummer/percussionist. A praise team will never function well without a knowledgeable drummer: one who knows how to play well, is sensitive to the singing, not always out in ?front? and willing to be taught.</p>
<p>A drummer makes or breaks a service, especially if the congregation is not used to having drums in the church worship experience. Start gently and go from there.</p>
<p>3. Acoustic, electric guitars and bass. Always get the best available, and pay them well ? especially if they are not members of your fellowship. They should know how to read charts, improvise and be sensitive, again, to the congregational singing ? and not go off on obnoxious solos at any given time.</p>
<p>4. Singers. If desired, these can be as few as one or two and as many as eight, but no more. They?ll think they are a choir, and rehearsals will be difficult with too many people. The singers should be good musicians, have good facial expressions, dress properly and realize they are leading and not trying to out-sing the congregation.</p>
<p>Choose both men and women, evenly divided. Allow them to sing parts, not just the melody. This will encourage the congregation to also sing parts, since there is usually only a word sheet provided. Provide them choral scores if available.</p>
<p>5. Rehearsals are a must. The team cannot just walk in Sunday mornings, have a quick run through and expect their lack of preparation to pay dividends. Some teams meet 90 minutes before a service and have a thorough, disciplined rehearsal and a time of prayer. Other teams meet on another night and spend 90 minutes to two hours in preparation.</p>
<p>And, why not? They are charged with the sacred responsibility of leading God?s people to the Throne of Grace and Mercy, and this responsibility should never be taken lightly! Without a good rehearsal, there will be little professionalism in the presentation, and God?s people deserve the best.</p>
<p>6. Visits. The committee should visit surrounding churches that have both successful and unsuccessful blended worship services. This way, they can get a good feel for what will work and not work in your situation, and then evaluate each experience to come to a decision about what to expect and plan to work from there. &amp;#160;</p>
<p>7. Plan the first ?blended experience? when everything is in place. The worship team is ready, the people have been told, primed and are prepared for a new experience. This may take weeks or even months, but it is necessary.</p>
<p>Study your situation and consider if the congregation is really ready for a change in the worship experience and if their worship preferences will match what the church leadership is planning.</p></article>

<article id="0000384" published-at="2008-11-07" title="And Now, Back to the Economy"><p></p>
<p>During his <a href="/mojoblog/archives/2008/11/10704_obama-acceptance-speech.html" type="external">victory speech</a>, President-elect Barack Obama told the world that ?if this financial crisis taught us anything, it?s that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers.?</p>
<p>It seems Wall Street didn?t get the memo. All nine banks about to get a total equity capital injection of $125 billion, courtesy of phase one of the bailout plan, reserved $108 billion during 2008 in order to pay for compensation and bonuses ( <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20081028142433.pdf" type="external">.pdf</a>). Guess who?ll end up footing the bill?</p>
<p>Helping to pay these awards was not supposed to be part of the bailout plan. On the contrary, when the Senate, including Obama, <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&amp;amp;session=2&amp;amp;vote=00213" type="external">approved</a> the $700 billion package in October, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson called this package one that would loosen the credit markets. The idea was that banks would start lending to each other again, as well as to citizens and small businesses.</p>
<p>That hasn?t happened, which is why it?s particularly offensive that this no-strings-attached money is going to line the pockets of the biggest executives on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs, the country?s top investment bank (which since September 21 calls itself a bank holding company), set aside $11.4 billion during the first nine months of this year to cover bonus payments for its 443 senior partners and other employees. That?s one-third less than last year?s amount, but only slightly more than the firm?s $10 billion US government gift. Economic woes notwithstanding, those partners are still <a href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/wall-streets-bonus-hopes-linger-despite-losses/?hp" type="external">expected to make</a> at least $5 million each. While Wall Street may not believe in higher taxes for the richest citizens, it does believe in higher bonuses for top executives. The bulk of bonus money on Wall Street concentrates there, after ferocious internal discussions about how much each person?s contribution to the firm is worth, no matter what the market conditions are on the outside. Trust me, I witnessed too many of these during my time on Wall Street. They are exercises in pure, unadulterated whines of entitlement.</p>
<p>Goldman?s CEO, Lloyd C. Blankfein, bagged a record bonus last year of $67.9 million, including $26.8 million in cash. That amount was nearly double the $38 million that Hank Paulson made at the firm in 2005, the year before he became the treasury secretary, a post for which he received <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/organization/bios/paulson-e.html" type="external">unanimous approval</a> from the Senate in 2006.</p>
<p>Last year, when the financial crisis was just in brewing mode, the top five investment banks paid themselves $39 billion in compensation and bonuses, up 6 percent from 2006. Two of those firms, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, went bankrupt this year. Bank of America is acquiring a third, Merrill Lynch. The remaining two, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, have seen their stock values plummet more than 60 percent.</p>
<p>Yet that didn?t stop their election money from pouring out. Goldman was Obama?s <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?cycle=2008&amp;amp;cid=N00009638" type="external">largest corporate campaign contributor</a>, with $874,207. Also in the Obama top 20 were three other recipients of bailout capital injections: JPM, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley. In the spirit of not sacrificing Main Street for Wall Street, this shouldn?t matter.</p>
<p>Last week ( <a href="http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20081028142314.pdf" type="external">.pdf</a>), House Oversight Committee chairman Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) gave the bailout capital recipient firms until November 10 to come up with some darn good reasons to be paying themselves so much. Specifically, he requested detailed information on the total and average compensation per year from 2006 to 2008, the number of employees expected to be paid more than $500,000 in total compensation, and the total compensation projected for the top 10 executives.</p>
<p>Similarly, New York state attorney general Andrew Cuomo demanded information about this year?s bonuses, requesting a detailed accounting of expected payments to top management, including the size of the firm?s expected bonus pool both before and after knowing that it would be a recipient of taxpayer funds.</p>
<p>As Cuomo told the firms, ?The American taxpayer has provided substantial funds to your firm; the preservation of those funds is a vital obligation of your company. Taxpayers are in many ways now like shareholders of your company, and your firm has a responsibility to them ( <a href="http://www.oag.state.ny.us/media_center/2008/oct/bank_letter.pdf" type="external">.pdf</a>).?</p>
<p>House Financial Service Committee chairman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) concurred. ?Any use of the these funds for any purpose other than lending?for bonuses, for severance pay, for dividends, for acquisitions of other institutions, etc.?is a <a href="http://www.house.gov/frank/tarp103108.html" type="external">violation of the terms</a> of the [Troubled Assets Relief Program] Act.? Next week, his committee will hold oversight hearings on the matter.</p>
<p>To combat these inquires, Wall Street has gone into its best defense mode, projecting an aura of being accommodating and self-deprecating (because it is shedding jobs, too), in order to remain in its status-quo state of self-regulation. Banks are going to tell Congress that of course they won?t use that $125 billion for bonuses?it will go to shoring up balance sheets and for acquisitions just like they promised, whereas the bonus money will come from earnings, as it always does.</p>
<p>If that sounds like accounting prattle, it?s because it is. It doesn?t matter where in the balance sheet capital comes from or goes; the point is, there?s more of it because of taxpayer redistribution in the wrong direction than there would have been otherwise, and that is not just.</p>
<p>According to Gar Alperovitz, economist and coauthor with Lew Daly of the book <a href="http://www.thenewpress.com/index.php?option=com_title&amp;amp;task=view_title&amp;amp;metaproductid=1741" type="external">Unjust Deserts</a>, that beautifully explains why too much money goes to those whose contributions are marginal compared to the historical contribution of others before them. ?We?re making homeowners take a big hit, and if there?s any justification for any of these bonuses, which is dubious, sharing that burden is important.?</p>
<p>That?s not quite the sharing that Wall Street wanted from the bailout package, but if ?change has come to America,? as per Obama?s promise, then it?s time for Wall Street to shoulder its share. Taxpayers will not be getting a personal return on their capital from Goldman Sachs partners. Getting involved in decisively saving taxpayer money from being distributed to the likes of Lloyd Blankfein before these payments are made would be an excellent way for Obama to invoke immediate change.</p>

<p>Early this year Wilkey and other Baptist state paper editors <a href="" type="internal">voiced</a> concern about unanswered questions concerning layoffs at the International Mission Board. Wilkey <a href="http://baptistandreflector.org/imb-more-questions-than-answers/" type="external">wrote</a> Jan. 28 that he is ?troubled by the lack of communication coming from the IMB.?</p>
<p>Current IMB policy allows for open meetings of certain committees for background information only and a closing plenary session that is open to the public unless trustees decide to go into executive session.</p>
<p>A June 3&amp;#160; <a href="http://baptistmessage.com/editorial-why-are-imb-leaders-not-answering-questions/" type="external">editorial</a> in the Baptist Message&amp;#160;in Louisiana asked ?Why are IMB leaders not answering questions?? about the termination of 1,132 missionaries and staff that leadership attributed to budget shortfalls.</p>
<p>?The Message is not a crusading investigative news outlet,? wrote editorial Will Hall, a former vice president at the SBC Executive Committee who directed Baptist Press. ?We simply try to ask questions Southern Baptists are asking among themselves.?</p>
<p>On Wednesday SBC messengers adopted a resolution encouraging ?journalists and news organizations ?&amp;#160;both secular and religious ?&amp;#160;to exercise responsibly their freedom? and all SBC entities ?to honor freedom of the press by continuing to make reasonable accommodations to the news media seeking to cover Southern Baptist entities and newsmakers.?</p>

<article id="0000386" published-at="2017-09-16" title="California Passes Immigrant Protections Bill"><p>Gov. Jerry Brown is expected to sign the California Values Act,&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-california-sanctuary-state-bill-20170916-story.html" type="external">passed&amp;#160;</a>by lawmakers Saturday, which would make the state a ?sanctuary state? with new protections for undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>The 27-11 vote, along party lines, was reached after lengthy negotiations. But immigrant rights groups applauded the final bill, noting that it represented a strong rebuke of President Donald Trump?s anti-immigration agenda, including the Justice Department?s&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/08/04/doj-bullying-cities-complying-anti-immigration-efforts" type="external">threats</a>&amp;#160;to withhold law enforcement grants from sanctuary cities.</p>
<p>?This was a hard-fought effort but the end product was worth the fight,? said Jennie Pasquarella, Immigrants? Rights Director with the ACLU of California. ?With SB 54, California will meaningfully improve state law to keep families together and communities whole?and not a moment too soon as the Trump administration continues its draconian and indiscriminate crackdown on immigrants.?</p>
<p>Under the law, state and local law enforcement officers will not be permitted to ask about a person?s immigration status during an arrest or police stop, and their communication with federal immigration authorities will be limited.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The bill also gives protections to inmates who are immigrants, allowing them to reduce their sentences by completing educational or rehabilitation programs, and ensures that schools, hospitals, libraries, and courthouses remain safe spaces for undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>The original proposal by Democratic state senator Kevin De Leon would have also prohibited state and local police from reporting undocumented immigrants to federal authorities unless they had committed violent or serious crimes.</p>
<p>The bill that is headed to Brown?s desk allows communication with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) regarding anyone who has committed any of the 800 crimes listed in the California Trust Law, which includes some misdemeanors and non-violent crimes. ICE agents will also still be able to enter county jails.</p>
<p>Even after the negotiations, the bill is the most ambitious of its kind; in 1987 Oregon passed a law barring state and local officers from detaining anyone solely on immigration charges, and state lawmakers have proposed&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/oregon/articles/2017-06-20/oregon-moves-to-strengthen-its-unique-sanctuary-state-status" type="external">strengthening</a>&amp;#160;that law this year with amendments similar to the measures introduced in California.</p>
<p>Proponents of the California Values Act cited residents? fear of law enforcement amid the looming threat of deportation as a vital reason to pass the bill.</p>
<p>?Now, more than ever, it is imperative that California law clearly distinguish state and local law enforcement officers from federal deportation agents,? said Pasquarella. ?At a time when police data indicates that domestic violence and sexual assault reporting is plummeting among Latinos, California has a moral obligation to ensure law enforcement agents treat everyone fairly, no matter their background, what they look like, or where they are born.?</p></article>

<p>A lawmaker, briefed by the National Intelligence Service (NIS), says leader Kim Jong Un himself gave the order to&amp;#160;make preparations.</p>
<p>?North Korea?s terrorist attack could be in the form of causing harms to anti-North Korean activists, North Korean defectors or government officials,? said Saenuri Party member, Lee Chul-woo, when CNN contacted his office Thursday.</p>
<p>Members of the ruling Saenuri Party held a closed-door meeting with the NIS, defense ministry and other ministries.</p>
<p>South Korea?s Presidential office said this latest NIS assessment highlights how important it is to pass an anti-terrorism bill they have been pushing for for some time.</p>
<p>Kim Sung-woo, a senior secretary at the Presidential office, known as the Blue House, said the law needs to be passed&amp;#160;?so that there could be a legal and institutional framework on anti-terrorism so that it can protect our people?s lives and property.?</p>

<p>Perhaps the American People are finally tired of the big government candidates that the establishment GOP has been pushing on them for decades. If this is true, it?s remarkable due to the massive push that was behind Bush to dethrone Trump. In the process of doing that, though, it seems that he may have hit the end of the road?.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://theresurgent.com/bush-campaign-sources-campaign-out-of-money-pay-ends-saturday/" type="external">TheResurgent</a>:</p>
<p>This is pretty remarkable. Sources close to the Bush campaign are beginning to leak about a call last night. I?m told the Bush team is out of money. Pay for campaign staff will end on Saturday. The campaign is all but over.</p>
<p>Additionally, after having hundreds of millions of dollars on hand, the Bush Super PAC has less than $15 million from what I am being told.</p>
<p>What a waste.</p>
<p>Ironically, if Bush really wants to have an impact on the race, given that his campaign is broke, he should publicly get out of the race today. This would be like Rich Perry in 2012, who got out, cast his support to Gingrich at the last minute, and saw Gingrich storm into first place in South Carolina.</p>
<p>Bush could be the king maker if he gets out today.</p>
<p>Apparently Bush?s campaign contacted Erick Erickson ? the author of the quoted piece ? and denied there was a call and that the money was gone.</p>

<article id="0000396" published-at="2005-08-08" title="Hispanic Voters Revisited"><p></p>
<p>Stanley Greenberg?s new survey ( <a href="http://www.greenbergresearch.com/publications/dcorps/08022005_2005_hispanic_memo.pdf" type="external">PDF</a>) of Hispanic voters addresses a number of interesting points, but two really stand out here. The first is the rather obvious truism that candidates really do matter come election time. George W. Bush, of course, captured a near-historic percentage of the Hispanic vote, 40 percent in 2004. But he did this in part by distancing himself from the negative perceptions that Hispanics had of the Republican Party in general. Only 18 percent of Hispanics consider the GOP to be ?accepting of different cultures??indeed, the Democratic Party has a 40 point lead on the issue?but 30 percent thought the same of Bush himself. 30 percent is nothing to brag about in tolerance contests, but difference came in handy on election day. Unfortunately for the GOP, no other presidential name for 2008 seems to carry a similar personal advantage.</p>
<p>Now as to why Kerry did relatively poorly among Hispanics, some 39 percent claimed that they had no idea ?what he stood for.? Yeah, well, so it goes, we?ve heard this ad infinitum and it?s not clear what Democrats can do about this besides, perhaps, run a more comprehensible candidate (Hispanics give Bill Clinton, for instance, an overwhelmingly warm personal rating). Anyway, the second reason?28 percent?had to do with Kerry?s ?permissiveness on abortion and gay marriage,? which would appear to give ?centrist? Democrats <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0121/p03s01-uspo.html" type="external">yet another excuse</a> to sacrifice abortion rights in order to reclaim swing voters. But if you look a bit farther down, a pro-life Democrat would run only slightly better than a pro-choice Democrat, and support for stem cell research pretty much swamps any edge an abortion foe could bring. (Obviously a pro-life, pro-stem cell candidate would do best, but Bill Frist?s delusions of the White House aside, there aren?t many presidential contenders who take this view.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one should note that Hispanic voters under 30 and Hispanic voters with a college education are overwhelmingly pro-choice (60 and 62 percent respectively). So Bush may have won himself a slight advantage in 2004 on the issue, but over time?given changing demographics and, one would hope, a greater proportion of Hispanics going to college?abortion will turn into a much less successful wedge issue for Republicans to wield. For that matter, read Digby?s <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2005_07_31_digbysblog_archive.html#112337034311216704" type="external">weekend post</a> on this very topic?although I?d note that, at least as far as the polls are concerned, the left-liberal position on both the intelligent design debate and the Ten Commandments-in-the-courthouse debate seem to be spectacularly lost causes. But other than that?</p>

<article id="0000398" published-at="2012-06-04" title="Reviving the 'African miracle'"><p>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast ? For much of the past decade Ivory Coast has not been on anyone?s list as an ideal investment destination. Civil war tore the country apart between 2002 and 2004 and then there was renewed violence last year following the presidential election.</p>
<p>Now, a year after the country returned to peace, financier Michel Abrogoua is hunting new investments to help return the war-torn economy to prosperity.</p>
<p>?You have investors that are coming because they trust President Alassane Ouattara himself and also the government,? said Abrogoua from a conference room on the top floor of a high-rise in Abidjan. ?It?s something people are betting on. They say, ?Despite what we hear here and there, we think there is hope.??</p>
<p>Ivory Coast?s strong infrastructure, tradition of good governmental administration, and existing industrial sector are attracting investors, he said. And given the poor economic climate in the West, many investors are looking to riskier markets with high potential for growth in the developing world.</p>
<p>Abrogoua, 59, the founder and CEO of Phoenix Capital Management, a licensed stock brokerage and investment bank, has come a long way from a middle-class family thanks to a far-sighted program by Ivory Coast?s founding president, F?lix Houphouet-Boigny, who established government scholarships to allow talented students to study overseas.</p>
<p>Abrogoua won one of those scholarships and earned an MBA from Adelphi University in New York in 1980. Like many others with those scholarships, Abrogoua became part of a cadre of well-educated Ivorians who are putting the country?s economy back on track. The scholarship program is credited with endowing the country with a group of educated entrepreneurs who have made Abidjan the financial hub of West Africa.</p>
<p>In 1998, Abrogoua worked with the World Bank?s International Finance Corporation and Framlington Ltd., a UK-based fund manager, to set up the first private equity fund for Francophone Africa, called the West Africa Growth Fund.</p>
<p>?Three years later I was invited ? to set up a similar fund for the central Africa region, called the Central Africa Growth Fund. I was chairman there and managing director here,? he said.</p>
<p>More from GlobalPost: <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/africa/120531/liberia-economy-women-entrepreneur" type="external">Liberia's entrepreneurial women start small</a></p>
<p>Now, as the CEO of Phoenix Capital Management, which he founded in 2005, Abrogoua advises the Ivorian and other regional governments on major infrastructure projects in the telecommunication and energy sectors.</p>
<p>For several decades, Ivory Coast?s economy was the largest in West Africa. But per capita income declined by 15 percent between 1999 and 2009. Now, Ivory Coast?s economy, with a GDP of $35.6 billion ? $1600 per capita ? while still larger than many of its neighbors, lags behind Ghana, Cape Verde, Nigeria, Cameroon, Senegal and Chad.</p>
<p>Abrogoua said the greatest hindrance to entrepreneurs is the lack of financing for small and medium enterprises.</p>
<p>?The commercial banks are not well-equipped to address these limitations, both in terms of resources and expertise,? said Abrogoua. So last year with $50 million he launched a regional private equity fund called the West Africa Emerging Markets Growth Fund ?to provide equity resources to small and medium-sized companies operating in the region.?</p>
<p>Abrogoua hopes the fund will help entrepreneurs stimulate economic growth in Ivory Coast and in neighboring countries.</p>
<p>From the 1960s through most of the 1990s Ivory Coast was West Africa?s most prosperous and stable country. However, after the death of Houphouet-Boigny in 1993, Ivory Coast entered a period of extended political crisis that led to the civil war. The uncertainty and conflict hindered economic development and scared away investors, Abrogoua said.</p>
<p>More from GlobalPost: <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/africa/south-africa/120530/south-africa-entrepreneur-business-economy" type="external">South Africa seeking an entrepreneurial revolution</a></p>
<p>?While Africa has been perceived over the past decade as the next investment frontier, Ivory Coast did not really benefit from new investments,? said Abrogoua. Following an attempted coup d??tat in 2002, the country underwent a de facto split between a rebel held north and the government-controlled south.</p>
<p>?The risk was, security-wise you could not rely on anybody. In a normal situation you have strong legal security that you can rely on as an investor, but in this specific situation like the one we had ? You are left to yourself. You cannot go to the court. You don?t have anybody to protect you, and for an investor this is the worst situation,? said Abrogoua.</p>
<p>The crisis reignited following the November 2010 presidential elections when former President Laurent Gbagbo refused to concede defeat and a six-month power struggle ensued. The country teetered on the brink of civil war, but luckily, said Abrogoua, ?the key points of activity: the factories, transportation and energy production infrastructures remained intact,? which has allowed a quick recovery of economic activities when the fighting ended in April 2011.</p>
<p>Despite sporadic incidents of violence, mainly between the military and civilians, which continue in many parts of the country, Abrogoua is optimistic.</p>
<p>"[Ivory Coast] is on the path to recovery. The rate of growth is expected to reach 8.5 percent this year,? he said. ?The country's entrepreneurs are already working to spur economic growth.?&amp;#160;</p>

<p>Responding to years of pressure from immigrant activists, President Obama took <a href="" type="internal">executive action</a> on November 20 to provide relief for immigrants. Labor Notes interviewed two activists about the executive order and what?s next in the fight for immigrant rights.</p>
<p>Arianna Salgado is a Chicago-based immigrant and education activist and member of the <a href="http://www.iyjl.org/" type="external">Immigrant Youth Justice League</a>.&amp;#160;Guillermo Perez is the President of the Pittsburgh Labor Council on Latin American Advancement (LCLAA), a member activist in the steelworkers union (USW) local 3657, and a member of the Labor Notes policy committee.</p>
<p>Tell us about your experience in the immigrant rights movement.</p>
<p>Arianna Salgado:&amp;#160;I?m undocumented but I have Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival [DACA], which provides me with a work permit and Social Security number and protection against deportation. I?ve been involved in the immigrant rights movement since 2010 or 2011? through the issue of access to education for undocumented students.</p>
<p>Eventually I got involved in the fight against deportations and detentions. We were trying to highlight the reality that people who are in detention or who are facing deportation aren?t these criminals that we?re often times made to believe.</p>
<p>Guillermo Perez:&amp;#160;I?ve been involved in the fight to reform the immigration laws for 15 years. My involvement came from representing undocumented workers who were in the union that I was working for. I really see the fight for immigration reform as a labor fight, because I think that the question of immigration is fundamentally a labor question.</p>
<p>The thing that we were fighting for all along was to achieve something in the way of protections for people so that they could become full-fledged participants in our society, without any regard to whether they had papers or not. In LCLAA we say,&amp;#160;?las luchas obreras no tienen fronteras,?&amp;#160;?workers? fights don?t have borders.?</p>
<p>Obama?s announcement centered on the creation of a new immigrant status called Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA). What do you think of this new status for undocumented parents of children who are citizens or permanent residents?</p>
<p>GP:&amp;#160;I think it?s an important achievement. It?s the product of tremendous struggle on the part of immigrant rights activists who really put pressure on this president to do something about the situation. As a victory we have to take it, and we have to build on it.</p>
<p>The White House claims that over 5 million immigrants could be eligible for the new and expanded statuses, out of an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Immigrants cannot yet apply for DAPA or the expanded DACA. The changes are expected to happen incrementally in the coming months, unless they are somehow blocked by Congress.</p>
<p>There are 5 million people eligible for DAPA and this now expanded DACA program. The challenge is getting those folks to apply, get them legal status, and make sure that they never lose it. If we don?t get enough people into the program, then it?s more likely that it could be taken away.</p>
<p>AS:&amp;#160;I think it?s definitely a step towards the right direction. We?re very well aware of the fact that it doesn?t cover even half of the people in our community. But we understand how it may be significant to those that it does cover.</p>
<p>The much-accepted narrative is that if an individual is in detention or deportation proceedings then they must have done something really bad to get there. But what we find is that these are individuals who were just picked up, sometimes on routine traffic checks. Even though President Obama has announced DACA and DAPA, the reality is that the deportations will not decrease. This announcement doesn?t really impact that.</p>
<p>What do you think of Obama?s claim that DAPA will allow millions of undocumented immigrants to ?come out of the shadows??</p>
<p>AS:&amp;#160;It?s important to highlight that this whole concept of ?coming out of the shadows? is&amp;#160; <a href="http://labornotes.org/blogs/2014/03/no-papers-no-fear" type="external">something that comes from the grassroots</a>; it doesn?t come after a politician provides some sort of announcement. The concept of ?coming out of the shadows? is something that people who are undocumented have been doing since about 2010.</p>
<p>I can only speak to DACA, because that?s the only one that has a process right now, but that might give us some insight into how people might react to DAPA. Individuals who have applied to DACA understand that it doesn?t provide us a pathway to permanent legalization, but also understand that it does provide us with some new resources. Before, we weren?t able to work legally, we didn?t have the ability to consider different employment options because we didn?t have a Social Security number.</p>
<p>Something that DAPA may bring is the ability to have more employment options other than just what individuals have had access to, which is usually really low-wage jobs. I?m not saying that all of a sudden people are going to have access to great jobs and pay and benefits, but at least it does provide a bit more opportunity than what people had before.</p>
<p>GP:&amp;#160;I think that it?s vitally important that we convince people that it?s worth doing. In some ways it?s no different than an organizing campaign that we wage. When we talk to workers and they say, ?Can I get fired for joining the union?? Yeah, it?s a possibility, but if you don?t join then nothing?s ever going to change.</p>
<p>Some have criticized DAPA?s eligibility requirements (high fees, criminal background checks, five years? proof of residency in the U.S., a citizen or permanent resident child). How would you respond?</p>
<p>AS:&amp;#160;It does require you to prove your continued presence in the Untied States. For those individuals who don?t have access to all the documents that are required, it will be a challenge.</p>
<p>I can speak to the experience of some of my friends who have had to move since they?ve been in the country. They haven?t had the opportunity to collect documents that prove that they?ve been here since they were six. They?re now 20. That?s a problem.</p>
<p>The announcement doesn?t do anything to address detention or deportation.</p>
<p>We can also see how the U.S. citizen or resident child requirement may be challenging for LGBTQ families who may not be able to adopt children [or may only have one parent considered a legal guardian and therefore eligible for DAPA]. It leaves out people who don?t have U.S. citizen or resident children, even if they qualify under all the other requirements.</p>
<p>What do you make of Obama?s announcement that he will end the&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/06/opinion/the-secure-communities-illusion.html?_r=0" type="external">much-criticized Secure Communities</a>&amp;#160;program?</p>
<p>GP:&amp;#160;If there?s a certain amount of cynicism being expressed when it comes to this part of the executive action, I think it?s warranted. It?s a victory in a sense, but it?s like a contract victory. You fight like hell, you win something in a contract, but enforcement is everything. Is ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] really going to comply? The president?s record on this has not been great in the past, so people have every reason to be concerned. But that?s our job as activists: to bring it up and to give him grief if they?re not complying with what was supposed to be done.</p>
<p>Employers are known to collude with ICE to retaliate against workers who are organizing by using I-9 audits?sometimes called&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.defendingdissent.org/now/news/immigration-enforcement-a-tool-to-silence-workers/" type="external">?silent raids?</a>?to intimidate and punish workers. Will Obama?s announcement have any effect on this workplace intimidation?</p>
<p>GP:&amp;#160;I actually think the executive action could be a huge help. I think it will help us in organizing workplaces where there are substantial numbers of undocumented people who now will have some form of legal status.</p>
<p>AS:&amp;#160;That?s one hope that I do have for this. Both of my parents qualify under our current understanding of the announcement. My mother has faced very bad work environments. When she tried to organize she was immediately fired, and struggled for a bit to find employment after that.</p>
<p>Her employer was very well aware of the fact that she is undocumented. She had been there for 10 years. He said, ?if I fire you, I know it?s going to be hard for you to find employment because you don?t have a Social [Security number].? So he knew that my mom was at a disadvantage, and that getting rid of her would stop a lot of the organizing that she was trying to create there. I?m hoping that, with access to these new resources, some of the fear will go away.</p>
<p>How have you responded to Obama?s announcement?</p>
<p>AS: I was one of the individuals&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/25/obama-heckled-immigration_n_6222256.html?utm_hp_ref=politics" type="external">who interrupted President Obama here in Chicago</a>&amp;#160;[in December]. We decided to take that action because we were with a family in which the father is in deportation proceedings. When we heard President Obama say that his priority was criminals, we felt the need to make sure that everyone understood that this is not true? This father does not match up with Obama?s description of a criminal, and yet he?s in deportation proceedings. Obama?s announcement isn?t going to help him.</p>
<p>How can activists support immigrants in the ongoing struggle?</p>
<p>GP:&amp;#160;I?d love to see union halls all over the country opening up and serving as places where people can come to get good information to apply. That would be beautiful. And that?s what we?re working towards in LCLAA.</p>
<p>If you really support the immigrant rights movement and want to do something to address the fight of the undocumented, then find an organization that?s doing this work, give them money, volunteer your time, and also be out there on the street when they mobilize people to put pressure on politicians.</p>

<article id="0000402" published-at="2016-05-20" title="Google to France: Knock it Off With the 'Right to Be Forgotten' Demands"><p></p>
<p>Google really doesn't want to expand its Right to be Forgotten program beyond Europe. The company&amp;#160;on Thursday appealed an order from French data protection authority CNIL to remove certain search results globally.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>"As a matter of both law and principle, we disagree with this demand," Kent Walker, Google senior vice president and general counsel, wrote in an op-ed published <a href="http://googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/a-principle-that-should-not-be-forgotten.html" type="external">on the company blog Opens a New Window.</a> and <a href="http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2016/05/19/ne-privons-pas-les-internautes-francais-d-informations-legales_4922590_3232.html" type="external">in France's Le Monde newspaper Opens a New Window.</a>.</p>
<p>The right to be forgotten?or, as Walker calls it, "a right to be delisted from search results"?was created in a 2014 ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). It requires that, if requested, search engines like Google and Microsoft Bing must consider removing links to specific information in its results?"even when those links point to truthful and lawfully published information like newspaper articles or official government websites," Walker said.</p>
<p>Google complied, scrubbing results only on European sites?Google.de in Germany or Google.fr in France, for example. So anyone in those countries could go to Google.com to find the delisted results. In February, the company reluctantly <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2499145,00.asp" type="external">changed that Opens a New Window.</a>, and delisted&amp;#160;links on all domains, including Google.com, when viewed in the country from which the request came. Anyone outside the EU, meanwhile, can still see the link on non-European domains.</p>
<p>The CNIL's latest order, filed in March, pushes Google even further by demanding it apply French law to global sites. That is, removing links to content that may be legal locally from Australia to Zambia, and everywhere in between.</p>
<p>"This order could lead to a global race to the bottom, harming access to information that is perfectly lawful to view in one's own country," Walker said. "We have received demands from governments to remove content globally on various grounds?and we have resisted, even if that has sometimes led to the blocking of our services."</p>

<p>Across Europe, Google has reviewed nearly 1.5 million webpages, delisting about 40 percent; France alone accounts for 300,000-plus sites, half of which have been expunged.</p>

<article id="0000406" published-at="2014-11-10" title="AP IMPACT: US agencies struggle vs. cyberattacks"><p>A $10 billion-a-year effort to protect sensitive government data, from military secrets to Social Security numbers, is struggling to keep pace with an increasing number of cyberattacks and is unwittingly being undermined by federal employees and contractors.</p>
<p>Workers scattered across more than a dozen agencies, from the Defense and Education departments to the National Weather Service, are responsible for at least half of the federal cyberincidents reported each year since 2010, according to an Associated Press analysis of records.</p>
<p>They have clicked links in bogus phishing emails, opened malware-laden websites and been tricked by scammers into sharing information. One was redirected to a hostile site after connecting to a video of tennis star Serena Williams. A few act intentionally, most famously former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who downloaded and leaked documents revealing the government's collection of phone and email records.</p>
<p>Then there was the federal contractor who lost equipment containing the confidential information of millions of Americans, including Robert Curtis of Monument, Colorado.</p>
<p>"I was angry, because we as citizens trust the government to act on our behalf," he said. Curtis, according to court records, was besieged by identity thieves after someone stole data tapes that the contractor left in a car, exposing the health records of about 5 million current and former Pentagon employees and their families.</p>
<p>At a time when intelligence officials say cybersecurity now trumps terrorism as the No. 1 threat to the U.S. ? and when breaches at businesses such as Home Depot and Target focus attention on data security ? the federal government isn't required to publicize its own brushes with data loss.</p>
<p>On Monday, the U.S. Postal Service said it was the victim of a cyberattack and that information about its employees, including Social Security numbers, may have been compromised. And last month, a breach of unclassified White House computers by hackers thought to be working for Russia was reported not by officials but The Washington Post. Congressional Republicans complained even they weren't alerted to the hack.</p>
<p>"It would be unwise, I think for rather obvious reasons, for me to discuss from here what we have learned so far," White House press secretary Josh Earnest later said about the report.</p>
<p>To determine the extent of federal cyberincidents, which include probing into network weak spots, stealing data and defacing websites, the AP filed dozens of Freedom of Information Act requests, interviewed hackers, cybersecurity experts and government officials, and obtained documents describing digital cracks in the system.</p>
<p>That review shows that 40 years and more than $100 billion after the first federal data protection law was enacted, the government is struggling to close holes without the knowledge, staff or systems to outwit an ever-evolving foe.</p>
<p>"It's a much bigger challenge than anyone could have imagined 20 years ago," said Phyllis Schneck, deputy undersecretary for cybersecurity at the Department of Homeland Security, which runs a 24/7 incident-response center responding to threats.</p>
<p>Fears about breaches have been around since the late 1960s, when the federal government began shifting its operations onto computers. Officials responded with software designed to sniff out malicious programs and raise alarms about intruders.</p>
<p>And yet, attackers have always found a way in. Since 2006, there have been more than 87 million sensitive or private records exposed by breaches of federal networks, according to the nonprofit Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, which tracks cyberincidents at all levels of government through news, private sector and government reports.</p>
<p>By comparison, retail businesses lost 255 million records during that time, financial and insurance services lost 212 million and educational institutions lost 13 million. The federal records breached included employee usernames and passwords, veterans' medical records and a database detailing structural weaknesses in the nation's dams.</p>
<p>Marc Maiffret, a hacker turned cybersecurity expert, said "today's a little scarier" than when he was breaking into systems in the '90s. Malware and viruses can be purchased or rented, so advanced coding skills aren't required. And there's more mischief to be made, because the government depends on technology for everything from missile targeting to student loan processing.</p>
<p>"There's also a much bigger allure to use these skills to make money, in a criminal sense," said Maiffret, co-founder of the cybersecurity firm Beyond Trust, whose customers include the military.</p>
<p>From 2009, when the government began breaking out different types of incidents, to 2013, the number of reported breaches just on federal computer networks ? the .gov and .mils ? rose from 26,942 to 46,605, according to the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team or US-CERT, which helps defend against cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Last year, US-CERT responded to a total of 228,700 cyberincidents involving federal agencies, companies that run critical infrastructure like nuclear power plants, dams and transit systems, and contract partners. That's more than double the incidents in 2009. And employees are to blame for at least half of the problems.</p>
<p>Last year, for example, about 21 percent of all federal breaches were traced to government workers who violated policies; 16 percent who lost devices or had them stolen; 12 percent who improperly handled sensitive information printed from computers; at least 8 percent who ran or installed malicious software; and 6 percent who were enticed to share private information, according to an annual White House review.</p>
<p>Internal documents released to the AP show how workers were lured in.</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Education employees ? who had been warned repeatedly: "Think Before You Click!" ? received an email a few weeks before Christmas 2011. "Your Amazon.com order of "Omron XEZ-740V Fat Loss" has shipped!" said the subject line, suggesting they click on a link.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, several of your co-workers have fallen victim to this particular attack," said an urgent message from an incident response team. The department did not release information to the AP about any resulting damage. Meantime, reported cyberattacks at the agency have increased from 10 breaches with actual data loss in 2011 to 89 in 2013.</p>
<p>Reports from the Defense Department's Defense Security Service, tasked with protecting classified information and technologies in the hands of federal contractors, show how easy it is for hackers to get into DOD networks.</p>
<p>One security analyst, when notified that an account appeared to be infected with a virus, looked at the user's history and found he was redirected to a hostile site after trying to play a tennis video. Another military user sought help after receiving messages that his computer was infected when he visited a website on schools. Officials tracked the attacker to what appeared to be a Germany-based server.</p>
<p>"No matter what we do with the technology ... we'll always be vulnerable to the phishing attack and ... human-factor attacks unless we educate the overall workforce," said Eric Rosenbach, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Global Security.</p>
<p>In June, the General Accountability Office released a scathing review of smaller federal agencies' protections. One problem was not fully implementing security training programs for staff.</p>
<p>Email encryption, which protects the contents of messages, is one way the government is seeking to shore up cybersecurity. Fifty-one percent of all federal agencies in 2013 reported using a federally approved encryption service, up from 35 percent in 2012. But some departments, including State, reported zero percent compliance with any approved encryption provider. The State Department wouldn't comment, citing security concerns.</p>
<p>Federal systems grow more susceptible to attack as the government's online offerings expand to user-friendly websites and apps, experts said.</p>
<p>At a hacking convention in Las Vegas in August, Joe Abbey, the director of software for Arxan, an app security service, showed how easy it can be to break in.</p>
<p>Abbey demonstrated how someone could take an iPhone from a doctor who had downloaded a free .gov app to track Medicare and Medicaid payments, run several malicious files and return the device. From that point on, he said, the thief could track every payment and medical record entered.</p>
<p>"This now exposes everything that's inside this app," he said.</p>
<p>Another challenge is that cybersecurity experts are expensive and in short supply. A June study by RAND found the federal government, which doesn't pay as well as private firms, is particularly short-handed.</p>
<p>There are some 90,000 federal information technology security workers, one-third of them contractors. And while the government is projected to hire thousands more and spend $65 billion on cybersecurity contracts between 2015 and 2020, many experts believe the effort is not enough to catch up with a growing pool of hackers whose motives vary.</p>
<p>There are government-sponsored attacks: Cybersecurity firm Mandiant this year tracked Iranian-based hackers targeting several unidentified U.S. government agencies, while the Pentagon last year said Chinese government hackers stole plans for more than two dozen U.S. weapons systems, including an F-35 fighter.</p>
<p>A cyberattack similar to other hacker intrusions from China penetrated computer networks for months at USIS, the government's leading security clearance contractor, before the company noticed earlier this year, officials told the AP. The intrusion compromised the private records of at least 25,000 Homeland Security employees.</p>
<p>Thieves interested in selling valuable data also dig in. Others have less nefarious motives. In February 2013, someone broke into the Emergency Alert System, broadcasting warnings about a zombie attack in California, Michigan, Montana and New Mexico.</p>
<p>Jeremy Hammond, of Chicago, considers himself an activist who hacks to expose wrongs or promote social justice. He is serving 10 years in prison for breaking into the networks of security think tank Stratfor, whose clients include the departments of Homeland Security and Defense.</p>
<p>"I hacked a lot of stuff but the government, they're hacking all over the world," Hammond said in an interview from prison.</p>
<p>Only a small fraction of attackers are caught. Last year, the Justice Department filed 146 cases under the government's computer hacking statute. On Oct. 20, the FBI announced the arrest of a National Weather Service employee accused of illegally downloading sensitive files from the National Inventory of Dams in 2012.</p>
<p>For every thief or hostile state, there are tens of thousands of victims like Robert Curtis.</p>
<p>He declined to talk about specifics of his case. According to court records, a thief in September 2011 broke into a car parked in a San Antonio garage and stole unencrypted computer backup tapes containing Social Security numbers and medical information of Pentagon employees and troops. The car belonged to an employee of a federal contractor tasked with securing those records.</p>
<p>Ever since, criminals have tried to get cash, loans, credit, emergency funds ? even establish businesses ? in Curtis' name. He and his wife have frozen bank and credit accounts. His credit union once transferred $32,500 out of his account. That, he got back.</p>
<p>Curtis described the experience as "devastating." This summer a lawsuit brought by victims against the contractor, the Defense Department and a military health insurer was dismissed.</p>
<p>"It is very ironic," said Curtis, himself a cybersecurity expert who worked to provide secure networks at the Pentagon. "I was the person who had paper shredders in my house. I was a consummate data protection guy."</p>

<article id="0000407" published-at="2017-07-24" title="Black women turn to firearms for self-defense across US"><p>Few states track gun ownership by sex and race but African American gun clubs say ownership among black women is rising and women are signing up for firearm instruction in record numbers.</p>
<p>?I thought it would be the brothers joining,? Philip Smith <a href="http://www.readingeagle.com/ap/article/ap-photos-american-black-women-feel-its-time-to-get-a-gun" type="external">told</a> AP. He founded the National African American Gun Association in 2012 and estimated it would attract about 300 members, a number achieved in its first month. The association now boasts 20,000 members in 30 chapters.</p>
<p>A surprising growth in membership is coming from black women, with more of them expressing concerns about living either alone or as single parents, and wanting to protect themselves and their homes.</p>
<p>Politics was also emerging as a reason for more African Americans becoming gun owners, Smith told AP.</p>
<p>?Regardless of what side you?re on, in the fabric of society right now, there?s an undertone, a tension that you see that groups you saw on the fringes 20 years ago are now in the open,? he said. ?It seems to me it?s very cool to be a racist right now, it?s in fashion, it?s a trend.?</p>
<p>Marchelle Tigner launched Trigger Happy Firearm Instruction in Atlanta, Georgia in November. The Army National Guard veteran says her mission is to ?effectively teach a million women how to shoot.?</p>
<p>Tigner?s first class sold out in two days, so she expanded it to 40 sign-ups. Three more classes in March sold out within 24 hours of being announced, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/27/black-women-guns-classes-racism-trump" type="external">according to</a> the Guardian.</p>
<p>?It?s important, especially for black women, to learn how to shoot,? Tigner told AP, adding that black women are more likely to be victims of domestic violence. ?We need to learn how to defend ourselves.?</p>
<p>A new report <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3004915" type="external">published</a> this month by the Crime Prevention Research Center, founded by gun advocate John Lott, shows there are more than 16.3 million concealed handgun permits in the US, a 1.83 million increase since last July. More Americans carry guns today than in 2007, when there were 4.6 million permits.</p>
<p>The report said women are largely fueling the increase. Among the eight states that had data from 2012 to 2016, permits for men grew by 22 percent and permits for women soared by 93 percent. In the 14 states with 2016 data on sex, women now make up 36 percent of permit holders.</p>

<p>Four in 10 US adults say they live in a gun-owning household and 48 percent said they grew up in a household with guns, according to a Pew Research Center study on guns and gun ownership published in June. Among gun owners, 67 percent cite protection as a major reason for owning one.</p>
<p>White men are still most likely to be firearms owners, with 48 percent saying they currently own a gun, compared with 24 percent of white women and nonwhite men, and 16 percent of nonwhite women.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/06/22/americas-complex-relationship-with-guns/" type="external">Pew</a> also found a vast urban-rural divide in gun ownership rates. Among adults who live in rural areas, 46 percent say they own a gun, versus 28 percent of adults who live in the suburbs and 19 percent in urban areas. Gun ownership is strongly linked to party affiliation, with 44 percent of Republicans and Independents owning a gun, and 20 percent of Democrats.</p></article>

<p>Watford pleaded guilty to submitting a forged bank letter to provide proof that Pozzo had enough funds to take over the club before the 2014-15 season. The team was in the second-tier League Championship at the time and won promotion to the Premier League that season.</p>

<article id="0000411" published-at="2010-05-27" title="McChrystal Returns to His Roots"><p>For the past several years Americans have been inundated by reams of journalistic puff pieces extolling the virtues of the new US Counterinsurgency (COIN) Strategy documented by General Petraeus in his much ballyhooed COIN manual ? which for the most part was a merely regurgitation of the failed thinking of French Marshal Lyautey?s ink spot strategy (that counterinsurgent forces should aim to secure an ever expanding geographic zone of security with each new area secured providing a basis for further spreading, and so on.)</p>
<p>It is becoming clear, however, the showpiece of this new strategy, the Marjah operation, has failed&amp;#160;to deliver on the promised security improvements&amp;#160;to the people, and in the words of the theater commander, General Stanley McChrystal, has become a ?bleeding ulcer.?</p>
<p>Coupled with the deadlines imposed by President President Obama, when he approved McChrystal?s ill-thought out plan&amp;#160;last Fall, notwithstanding the cogent&amp;#160;misgivings expressed by&amp;#160;Ambassador Eikenberry, it is now clear that McChrystal is under mounting pressure to deliver some progress by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Indeed, hair may be on fire at McChrystal?s Bagram headquarters. &amp;#160;Rumors are circulating in military circles of backbiting and finger pointing, as well as complaints that MacChrystal is being set up as a fall guy, while his boss, General Petraeus, skates to a Republican presidential nomination in 2012.</p>
<p>The stressed out psychological atmosphere appears to have induced General McChrystal to return to his special operations roots for a quick fix, by focusing even more on targeted assassinations in order to reverse the course of events, a sense of desperation smacking of&amp;#160;the infamous, Vietnam-era Phoenix Campaign.</p>
<p>Gareth Porter, certainly one of the most able observers of the Afghan Mess, just wrote an eye-opening account of McCrystal?s shift here on the <a href="" type="internal">CounterPunch</a> site. &amp;#160;Gone is the cosmetic COIN strategy purporting to win hearts and minds. &amp;#160;The name of the game is morphing into a hackneyed strategy with an unblemished record of failure in America?s wars of empire: Make deals with the devil to get the intelligence information needed to decapitate the insurgency by assassinating the insurgent leaders.</p>
<p>The strategy of decapitation reflects a tautological doctrinal mindset that goes back to the mechanical theory of strategic bombing that emerged from the Air Corps Tactical School in the 1930s: identify the enemy system?s critical nodes, use precision strikes to destroy these nodes, and because the nodes are vital to the enemy system?s survival, he will collapse, by definition. &amp;#160;It doesn?t matter whether these critical nodes are German ball bearing plants in WWII or guerrilla leaders in the Hindu Kush, the result is tautologically inevitable. &amp;#160;Moreover, the subtle art of war is reduced to a straight-forward engineering problem, where the object of war ? the adversary ? acts and reacts predictably. QED.</p>
<p>The problem with this kind of tautological thinking is, as Porter shows so clearly, is that the devil has his own agenda.</p>

<p>Trump was asked about North Korea Thursday afternoon during a joint press conference in the East Room of the White House with Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, the emir of Kuwait.</p>
<p>?Military action would certainly be an option. Is it inevitable? Nothing?s inevitable. It would be great if something else could be worked out,? Trump said.</p>
<p>?Each day new equipment is delivered. New and beautiful equipment, the best in the world, the best anywhere in the world, by far. Hopefully, we?re not going to have to use it on North Korea. If we do use it on North Korea, it will be a very sad day for North Korea.?</p>
<p>North Korea has conducted several tests of its missile and nuclear programs this year and has threatened to strike the United States or one of its territories. Trump has responded by sending troops and ships to the region in a show of force.</p>
<p>It was reported this week that U.S. Navy SEALs are <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/kim-jung-un-seal-team-six-navy-seals-assassination/2017/09/06/id/812068/" type="external">training a South Korean military team</a> to take out North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in the event that war breaks out on the peninsula.</p>
<p>Trump said North Korea needs to clean up its act and start listening to the international community?s warnings to curb its <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/North-Korea-ICBM-moving/2017/09/04/id/811581/" type="external">aggressive tone and actions</a>.</p>

<article id="0000420" published-at="2012-05-26" title="Shareholders Go Up Against Walmart"><p>We?re well into spring and heading smack into summer, so ?tis the season for outdoor barbecues, school commencements and, hold onto your beach towels, annual shareholders meetings.</p>
<p>The discount giant Walmart will hold its annual meeting on June 1. The company expects 14,000 to attend ? including 5,000 employees, chosen by their colleagues, flown in from stores around the world, all expenses paid.</p>
<p>It?s quite a party. The extravaganza, which in the past has featured entertainment by Will Smith and the Black Eyed Peas, among others, will be held at the University of Arkansas? Bud Walton Arena in Fayetteville, named after the co-founder of the now megalithic chain stores. He contributed half of the building?s $30 million construction cost.</p>
<p>This year?s meeting is an especially big deal because it?s the company?s 50th anniversary and the company?s stock is at a ten-year high (you can watch the proceedings live, if that?s your idea of a springtime fun, via the <a href="http://ow.ly/ba43p" type="external">Walmart website</a>.&amp;#160; But the celebrations may be a bit subdued as the Justice Department, Securities and Exchange Commission and the Mexican government continue investigating allegations of corporate corruption. <a href="http://ow.ly/ba4yu" type="external">According to the Reuters news service</a>:</p>
<p>?Wal-Mart was bombarded by negative comments from shareholders and activists after the New York Times reported in April that management at Wal-Mart de Mexico, or Walmex, allegedly orchestrated bribes of $24 million to help it grow quickly last decade and that Wal-Mart?s top brass tried to cover it up?</p>
<p>&amp;#160;?There is growing dissension among some shareholders who believe that current board members, including Chairman Robson ?Rob? Walton, CEO Mike Duke and former CEO Lee Scott, knew of the issue and should have taken corrective actions years ago.?</p>
<p>Stockholders include the two largest public pension funds in the country, the California Public Employees? Retirement System and the California State Teachers? Retirement System, as well as the New York City Pension Funds and Florida?s State Board of Administration, all of which have expressed their opposition to reelecting Walmart board members. Other groups, including OUR Walmart, an organization of current and former employees, take issue with the chain?s wages, working conditions, and aggressive opposition to unions.</p>
<p>But there?s another item on the agenda, a reaction to the Supreme Court?s Citizens United decision that?s been a hot ticket at stockholders meetings across the country: a vote on whether Walmart should be forced to reveal its political contributions. According to the <a href="http://ow.ly/baars" type="external">Chicago Tribune</a>:</p>
<p>?Investors filed more than 100 resolutions this year asking companies to disclose what they spend on political advocacy, according to Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisory service. The number of proposals for the first time exceeded shareholder resolutions on energy and environmental issues, which have long attracted significant interest from investors.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>?Shareholders want to know about direct donations to candidates as well as harder-to-track contributions to trade associations such as the <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics/lobbying/u.s.-chamber-of-commerce-ORCIG000081.topic" type="external">U.S. Chamber of Commerce</a> and other tax-exempt groups that support certain candidates or political parties.?</p>
<p>&amp;#160;The Tribune cites a 2010 study that found that ?86 percent of the Standard &amp;amp; Poor?s 500 companies have no disclosed policies regarding money given to trade associations or other groups not controlled by a candidate, so-called indirect political expenditures that have become highly controversial during the 2012 campaign season.?</p>
<p>Nell Minow, described by The Washington Post as ?a longtime corporate governance consultant who supports the push for transparency? <a href="http://ow.ly/bafA0" type="external">told the paper</a>:</p>
<p>?We really have no idea how much is being spent and where it?s being spent. This is the defining issue of our time ? the way that money and politics combine. If we don?t want the United States government to become a wholly owned subsidiary of corporate America, we need to do something about it.?</p>
<p>The non-partisan Center for Political Accountability reports that 101 companies have agreed to disclose at least some of their political spending but the resistance of big business remains strong. The Post reports that none of the stockholder proposals for greater transparency have passed ?though some have received votes exceeding 35&amp;#160;percent, a high number compared with most shareholder resolutions.? The result at Walmart, where the Walton family owns half of the 3.4 billion shares and deep-pocketed financial institutions are the next largest shareholders, is also expected to be a <a href="http://ow.ly/bafA0" type="external">thumbs down</a>:</p>
<p>?But passing the measures is not necessarily the point, advocates say. The main goal is to pressure companies to increase their disclosures, especially with the lack of action on Capitol Hill and within federal agencies.?</p>
<p>&amp;#160;One glimmer of hope, Walmart shoppers: the company?s fifth largest shareholder is Warren Buffett?s Berkshire Hathaway. At his annual meeting three weeks ago, <a href="http://ow.ly/bagxq" type="external">Buffett declared</a>, ?I think the whole idea of Super PACs is wrong. The idea that I should toss $10 million into some Super PAC that will spend its time misleading people about its opponent ? I don?t want to see democracy going in that direction.?</p>
<p>Berkshire Hathaway owns less than 1.5 percent of Walmart, but maybe some of Buffett?s common sense will rub off.</p></article>
<article id="0000424" published-at="2017-03-28" title="Republicans just shut down Trump?s request for border wall funding"><p>Senate Republicans are&amp;#160;stalling on approving funding&amp;#160;for Trump?s proposed border wall. Sen. <a href="http://thehill.com/people/roy-blunt" type="external">Roy Blunt</a> (R-Mo.), a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, just told reporters&amp;#160;that Trump?s supplemental funding request for the Mexican border wall will be delayed until later in the year.</p>
<p>?We have the FY17 defense bill,? Blunt said, saying that the supplemental spending bill might complicate the passage of a higher-priority military spending bill, so it should therefore be reviewed separately.</p>
<p>This is, essentially, a denial of Trump?s request to consider the bill alongside the FY17 defense bill.</p>
<p>Trump?s proposed supplemental spending bill&amp;#160;suggests cutting $18 billion from programs such as medical research, infrastructure and community grants so U.S. taxpayers can afford the down payment on the border wall. Many were outraged, and saw this as a betrayal of his oft-shouted ?make Mexico pay for it? campaign mantra.</p>
<p>?All of the committees, the leaderships of the House and Senate, are working together to try to finalize the rest of the FY17 bill,? Blunt added. ?My guess is that comes together better without the supplemental.?</p>
<p>Government funding is currently scheduled to expire on April 28th, and congressional leaders worry that Trump?s supplemental spending bill <a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/15/14937546/senate-democrats-government-shutdown-wall" type="external">may have led to a government showdown</a>.</p>
<p>?We believe it would be inappropriate to insist on the inclusion of such funding in a must-pass appropriations bill that is needed for the Republican majority in control of the Congress to avert a government shutdown so early in President Trump?s Administration,? the Senate Democratic leadership team <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/government-funding-bill-border-wall-democrats-235987" type="external">wrote in a letter</a> addressed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on March 13.</p>
<p>This will likely make the Trump administration?s troubles even worse, as it was already reeling from the defeats of their failed health care bill and the suspension of their revised Muslim travel ban. The border wall, at this point, had been his only major campaign promise which had not yet completely fallen apart.</p>

<article id="0000429" published-at="2016-12-13" title="Social Conservatives Upset With Tillerson"><p>On Tuesday, President-elect Donald Trump formally announced ExxonMobil CEO and Chairman Rex Tillerson as his pick for secretary of state, drawing a rush of criticism from both sides of the political aisle. Republicans such as Florida Senator Marco Rubio and Arizona Senator John McCain are questioning the CEO's ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, while Democrats are <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/10/23/obama_the_80s_called_they_want_their_foreign_policy_back/" type="external">ironically</a> echoing the same concerns. Others have raised Tillerson's lack of formal diplomatic experience as an issue.</p>
<p>And since our diplomatic affairs under President Obama have been linked directly to the left's social agenda, social conservatives also have a bone to pick over Tillerson: the executive's socially liberal activism, namely his push for openly gay Boy Scout troop leaders and his company's massive donations to scandal-ridden abortion giant Planned Parenthood.</p>
<p>Family Research Council (FRC) <a href="http://www.frc.org/get.cfm?i=WA16L24&amp;amp;f=WU16L08" type="external">reports</a>:</p>
<p>To hear that Donald Trump may be appointing a man who not only <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/12/05/exxonmobil-ceo-rex-tillerson-donald-trump/94987624/" type="external">led the charge to open the Boy Scouts to gay troop leaders</a> but <a href="http://dailysignal.com/2015/07/21/meet-the-41-companies-that-donate-directly-to-planned-parenthood/" type="external">whose company directly gives to Planned Parenthood</a> is upsetting at best. FRC knows Tillerson all too well, having worked for years to put the brakes on his reckless agenda for a scouting organization that was already dealing with staggering numbers of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boy-scouts-accused-of-long-history-of-sexual-abuse-in-lawsuit/" type="external">sexual abuse cases</a>. Unfortunately, the BSA, under Tillerson, ultimately caved to the pressure of the far-Left, irreparably splitting the Scouts and destroying a proud and honorable American tradition. Under his chairmanship, ExxonMobil's score on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality" Index has also skyrocketed to 87 percent.</p>
<p>Social conservatives are worried that the "deals" Tillerson will supposedly make for America will be laced with his socially liberal ideology, which he has previously demonstrated.</p>
<p>"Still, Trump calls Rex a 'world class player and dealmaker,' but if these are the kinds of deals Tillerson makes -- sending dollars to an abortion business that's just been referred for criminal prosecution and risking the well-being of young boys under his charge in an attempt to placate radical homosexual activists -- then who knows what sort of "diplomacy" he would champion at DOS?" asks FRC.</p>
<p>"To hear that Donald Trump may be appointing a man who not only led the charge to open the Boy Scouts to gay troop leaders but whose company directly gives to Planned Parenthood is upsetting at best."</p>

<p>Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, former CIA director and Secretary of Defense <a href="" type="internal">Bob Gates</a>and former national security adviser and Secretary of State <a href="" type="internal">Condoleezza Rice</a> have all praised the Tillerson pick.</p>

<article id="0000433" published-at="2016-03-26" title="In Antarctica, displaced penguins may be a sign of climate change"><p>When researchers who study Adelie penguins in Antarctica returned to their study site to find most of the birds gone, the event made headlines. But the headlines were mostly wrong, according to the researchers.</p>
<p>No one knows for sure what became of the missing birds, but Kerry-Jayne Wilson, one of the lead researchers and the author of a <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;amp;aid=10171606&amp;amp;fileId=S0954102015000644" type="external">new paper about the event</a>, wants to make one thing clear:</p>
<p>?I don't know where the ?150,000 dead penguins? came from. It didn't come from our paper,? she says. ?We did not suggest that adult penguins were being killed by this event. So some media outlet came up with ?150,000 dead penguins? and it's been repeated over and over again. We have recently put out a statement online correcting the misreporting of our work.?</p>
<p>Wilson, now retired from Lincoln University at Canterbury in New Zealand, is part of a long-established research team that studies how Adelie penguins are affected by climate change in Antarctica. In 2013-2014, the scientists returned to the colony?s summer breeding ground and found just a fraction of its former population.</p>
<p>It was quite a shock, Wilson says.</p>
<p>?Adelies are very aggressive normally, and very active penguins,? she explains. ?They are usually very noisy, but now the colony was silent. They were very subdued, sitting quietly and hardly acknowledged our intrusion. Normally when you're working with Adelies, they will come at you if you get too close to the colony ? hit you with their flippers, try biting you. And there were far fewer penguins than we would have expected to be there.?</p>
<p>The researchers&amp;#160;did find thousands of dead penguins ? but they were chicks, not adults, and many of them had probably died in the last year or two from lack of food. Wilson believes this is what happened:</p>
<p>In 2010, a Rhode Island-sized iceberg named B09B got stranded about 60 or 70 kilometers offshore of Cape Denison, where this Adelie colony breeds. Over the next couple of years, fast ice formed in the area between the land and the iceberg, isolating the breeding ground from open water. This cut the penguins off from their food supply and left them unable to feed their chicks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Antarctic coastline. The sea ice in the foreground would usually be open water. 'Fast ice' ? or ice that does not move with the wind or with sea currents ? formed between the massive iceberg and the land, cutting the Adelie colony&amp;#160;off from their access to food.</p>
<p>Kerry-Jayne Wilson</p>
<p>While the researchers can?t account for the missing adult penguins, Wilson believes ?it?s highly unlikely that they?ve died.?</p>
<p>?It's most likely that they did not bother to come back and attempt to breed,? she says. ?The really clever ones assessed the situation, assessed it as a year in which they will fail [to breed], and so they didn?t try. The ones that aren't quite so clever have made the long trip to the colony and have attempted to breed and have failed, either at the egg stage or the chick stage.?</p>
<p>So, if the colony has not died off and the ?clever ones? haven?t come back, where have they all gone?</p>
<p>?They'll just remain at sea,? Wilson says. ?They can live at sea for years. ...&amp;#160;The only reason penguins come back to the colony is to breed. So, if it's not suitable to breed, they just remain at sea, out on the pack ice ? ice floes, that are moving at the whim of the currents in the wind. Some may have gone to other colonies closer to open water, but my guess is that most just didn't bother [to come back] and cut their losses.?</p>
<p>Adelie penguins live all around the edges of the Antarctic continent. In the northernmost parts, on the Antarctic Peninsula below South America, Adelie penguins are in decline due to climate warming. The water temperature is rising, so there is less ice available.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the southern part of Antarctica, around the Ross Sea region, Adelie numbers have been going up. In east Antarctica, the area that Wilson works, Adelie numbers tend to be stable, but researchers predict that they will decline somewhat with changing pack ice conditions, Wilson says.</p>
<p>The Antarctic has warmed by a degree or so over the past decade, which causes the ice on the continent to flow into the sea more quickly. So all around Antarctica there are some huge ice shelves ? floating shelves of glacier ice. From time to time, icebergs break off the ends of these shelves.</p>
<p>?What we believe at this stage is that the break off of mega-icebergs is becoming more frequent,? Wilson says. ?We believe that in the next century or so, with climate warming, [we will see] an increase in the frequency of these dire events.?</p>

<article id="0000434" published-at="2018-07-14" title="Osama bin Laden Dead: His Pakistan Haven Near Islamabad"><p>It?s not shocking that Osama bin Laden was found in a comfortable Pakistan mansion?what?s shocking is that the U.S. pretends the country isn?t a harbor for terrorists. Plus, <a href="" type="internal">full coverage of bin Laden?s death</a>.</p>
<p>To me, as an American Muslim, it?s significant that <a href="" type="internal">bin Laden is dead</a>. American-Muslim groups zipped out statements through the night after news of his death: Muslims for Progressive Values said it ?expresses great relief? at the death, saying, ?Osama Bin Laden has singularly disgraced Islam and dragged our faith through the mud?? Islamic Information Center called him ?one of the greatest enemies of Islam, if not the entire world.? American Islamic Forum for Democracy said it ?applauds? the news.</p>
<p>Photos: <a href="/content/dailybeast/galleries/2011/05/02/inside-osama-bin-laden-s-hideout.html" type="external">Inside Osama bin Laden's Hideout</a></p>
<p>For me, what?s as important, however, is where bin Laden was killed: the hill-station town of <a href="/content/dailybeast/articles/2011/05/02/al-qaeda-after-bin-ladens-death.html" type="external">Abbottabad, Pakistan</a>, in the heartland of Pakistan in the province of Khyber Paktunkhwa, a province formerly known as the Northwest Frontier Province. He wasn?t found in a cave in Tora Bora, Afghanistan, but rather in a comfortable home in a hill station that could be a mini-Colorado Springs, Colorado, of Pakistan, complete with a military academy, numerous military installations, a St. Luke?s church and the Taj Majal Cinema.</p>
<p>Bin Laden?s refuge in Pakistan speaks to the safe haven the nation has given to militants and terrorist operatives for decades and, most troubling, in recent years in a culture of denial that the U.S. has enabled in its prickly relationship with Pakistan. In making the announcement, Obama said America?s ?friendship? with Pakistan allowed the operation to assassinate bin Laden, even thanking Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari.</p>
<p>As a journalist who has traveled Pakistan and tracked its links to militancy and terrorism, including the 2002 kidnapping and murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, I consider this sugarcoating just another chapter in America?s peculiar choice to pull its punches regarding a harsh but obvious reality: Pakistan has been a safe haven not only for bin Laden but for dozens of men involved in attacks on the U.S., including the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, whose ethnicity is rooted in the western Pakistani province of Baluchistan. For almost two years, I?ve been working as a cultural trainer to the U.S. military, teaching that the U.S. must know the heartland of Pakistan, from Karachi, a teeming city where so many operatives hide, to places such as southern Punjab, the heart of the country and home to the ?Punjabi Taliban? and the foot soldiers involved in Pearl?s kidnapping. As a journalist, I choose to do the cultural training, because I?ll never forget the name Pearl put on the last picture I have with him. We were in Karachi, and he called it, ?Clueless in Karachi.?</p>
<p>To know where so many men on the U.S. Most Wanted list have hidden is to know the geography of Pakistan?and not just the wild, wild west of the country?s border region with Afghanistan, but in its heartland and some of its finest neighborhoods, including military cantonments like the one near which bin Laden was killed. I created a Google map outlining cities where <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;msid=209329569017179450454.0004a2442e4e34d5941a7" type="external">al-Qaeda operatives</a> have been picked up. Zoom into Abbottabad, find St. Peter?s church and Gammi Adda Stop, a bus stop, and behind both spots you?ll see a neighborhood where a user had labeled ?Osama bin Laden?s compound,? off <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/05/osama-bin-ladens-compound-already-mapped-on-google/238116/" type="external">Awami Road</a>. It?s near the intersection of roads named for Pakistan?s founder, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, and the country?s Walt Whitman, poet Allama Iqbal.</p>

<p>While I haven?t been to Abbottabad, a city of about 125,000 people, it?s like hill stations I?ve visited around the nation?s capital, scenic, peaceful and home to top schools and resort hotels. I?ve driven not far from it on the highway to Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a magical land that writer Rudyard Kipling traveled and wrote poetic prose about.</p>
<p>Located on the Silk Road, known as the Korakoram Highway, it?s no outpost outside central government authority, like the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, where so much U.S. military strategy and media attention has been focused. It?s home to the Pakistan Military Academy, the equivalent of Pakistan?s West Point. It?s also got an important military cantonment as the headquarters of a brigade in the Second Division of Pakistan?s Northern Army Corps.</p>
<p>The namesake for Abbottabad, British Army Major James Abbott, founded the town in 1853, the ?abad? in its name meaning ?a place of living? in Urdu. Abbott wrote a poem called Abbottabad, enshrined in a <a href="http://www.panoramio.com/photo/21593241" type="external">city plaque</a>, that has an eerie ring today: ?I remember the day when I first came here/And smelt the sweet Abbottabad air/The trees and ground covered with snow/Gave us indeed a brilliant show/To me the place seemed like a dream/And far ran a lonesome stream/The wind hissed as if welcoming us/The pine swayed creating a lot of fuss/And the tiny cuckoo sang it away/A song very melodious and gay/I adored the place from the first sight/And was happy that my coming here was right/And eight good years here passed very soon/And we leave our perhaps on a sunny noon/Oh Abbottabad we are leaving you now/ To your natural beauty do I bow/Perhaps your winds sound will never reach my ear/My gift for you is a few sad tears/I bid you farewell with a heavy heart/Never from my mind will your memories thwart.?</p>
<p>Bin Laden is no longer a threat to the U.S., but a deeper problem remains: Pakistan?s safe harbor for men intent on harming the U.S.</p>
<p>Start and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.</p>
<p>A speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).</p>
<p>In much the same whimsy, we act as if Pakistan has just had a simple ?friendship? in America?s fight against al Qaeda, but the truth is that its role as a safe space for ideologues dates back to 1979. That year, an Islamist movement came to Pakistan under a military dictator, Gen. Zia ul Haq. Pakistani intelligence began supporting the mujahideen, or ?freedom fighters.? In the years after, men from bin Laden to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM) found an ideological and operational base in Pakistan. As a nation, we turned a blind eye because the freedom fighters were battling the U.S. enemy, the Soviet Union, after its 1979 invasion of Afghanistan. In 1989, the Soviets were defeated, and ideologues, including bin Laden, turned their eyes to attacks on the U.S.</p>
<p>Since then, bin Laden?s killing is the latest in a long string of bad guys found, killed, or snatched in Pakistan. In 1993, we had our first attack on the World Trade Center, and on Feb. 17, 1995, according to media reports, U.S. officials raided room number 16 in the Su-Casa Guest House in the city of Islamabad and captured the operational leader of the 1993 World Trade Center attack, Ramzi Yousef, before he headed off for the border city of Peshawar. He was a Pakistani, and he was the nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.</p>
<p>In 1994, British-Pakistani Muslim militant Omar Sheikh was arrested in India for allegedly kidnapping an American in New Delhi. On Dec. 31, 1999, he was freed in exchange for prisoners taken captive on an Indian Airlines jet hijacked from Kathmandu, Nepal, and diverted to Kandahar, Afghanistan, the headquarters for the Taliban in their emergence to power in Afghanistan. At the airport to give the men a welcome home party, according to Sheikh?s FBI report: bin Laden, who was a guest of the Taliban in Kandahar. From Kandahar in southern Afghanistan, Omar Sheikh slipped easily into Pakistan, was feted at a party in the coastal city of Karachi and then settled down, marrying and welcoming a son, in the Punjab province capital of Lahore. He moved freely in Pakistan, though the U.S. pressed for extradition on the 1994 kidnapping charge. In early January 2002, Sheikh met Wall Street Journal reporter Pearl at the Akbar Hotel in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, outside Islamabad, and hatched his plot to kidnap him. On Feb. 5, 2002, Sheikh turned himself into Pakistani intelligence in the city of Lahore, and the ISI secretly held him for a week before telling the FBI and the CIA.</p>
<p>The next month, in March 2002, FBI agents and CIA officials raided a safehouse in the city of Faisalabad, also in the province of Punjab, and picked up a senior al-Qaeda operational leader, Abu Zubaydah, who offered the U.S. its first clues that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was the mastermind behind 9/11. He disclosed something we hardly ever acknowledge: al-Qaeda operatives, from ?shoe bomber? Richard Reid to failed ?dirty bomber? Jose Padilla, freely traveled the roads through Pakistan to get operational instructions from KSM in Karachi.</p>
<p>That spring, KSM and another senior al-Qaeda operational leader Ramzi bin al-Shibh secretly gave an audacious interview to al Jazeera reporter Yosri Fouda, taking credit for 9/11. The interview aired on the first anniversary of 9/11, and, sure enough, on Sept. 11, 2002, U.S. officials picked up Ramzi bin al-Shibh in a safehouse in the posh Defence Housing Authority neighborhood of Karachi, not far from where I had rented a home months earlier.</p>
<p>The next year, on March 1, 2003, where did CIA officials pick up Khalid Sheikh Mohammed? A comfortable home in a military cantonment in the city of Rawalpindi. The list goes on and on. It?s not shocking to me that bin Laden was killed in the heart of Pakistan. As a Muslim dedicated to defeating the ideology of men like bin Laden, I said to myself what it is we are taught to say as Muslims whenever anyone dies: "Innalilahi wa inna ilayhi rajioon." It means: ?To God we belong and to Him we will return.?</p>
<p>Bin Laden is no longer a threat to the U.S., but a deeper problem remains: Pakistan?s safe harbor for men intent on harming the U.S. What matters now is that the U.S. stop enabling this very serious problem of Pakistan?s culture of denial for its base as a safe space for militants and al-Qaeda operatives. ?Never from my mind will your memories thwart,? Major Abbott said of the city where, about 150 years later, Osama bin Laden, America?s No. 1 enemy in the world, was killed.</p>

<article id="0000435" published-at="2017-02-27" title="MORON ALERT: Senator Tom Udall Says Gorsuch And Garland Should Be Confirmed Simultaneously"><p>Ever since President Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to replace Justice Scalia, the Democrats have lost their marbles. For example, Senator Jeff Merkley found himself on the receiving end of an <a href="" type="internal">earlier Moron Alert</a> for claiming that the Supreme Court vacancy was a "stolen seat," thus justifying a filibuster of Gorsuch's confirmation.</p>
<p>Since then, news of Gorsuch has been relatively quiet. However, senior United States senator from New Mexico Tom Udall met with Gorsuch today. While he did not explicitly suggest whether he would vote for or against him, he gave the following idea to the press: Nominate Gorsuch and former Obama nominee Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court at the same time.</p>
<p>Here was Udall's full comment:</p>
<p>You had President Trump saying, ?I want to unite the country, I?m a deal-maker, I?m going to bring people together. Well, the deal right now for President Trump, if he wanted to do it, would be to put Gorsuch and Merrick Garland on the court at the same time.</p>
<p>Here was how Politico <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/tom-udall-neil-gorsuch-merrick-garland-235442" type="external">described</a> Udall's justification for his ludicrous idea to place ten justices on the Supreme Court:</p>
<p>Trump would discuss the option with one of the three Supreme Court justices often mentioned as retirement prospects in the coming years ? Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer or Anthony Kennedy ? and secure a resignation letter from one of them, contingent on Garland getting nominated and confirmed as their replacement.</p>
<p>This entire idea is ridiculous for a handful of reasons:</p>
<p>First, the Supreme Court has consisted of nine justices ever since Congress <a href="http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/landmark_10.html" type="external">passed</a> the Judiciary Act of 1869. The law <a href="https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;amp;fileName=016/llsl016.db&amp;amp;recNum=79" type="external">states</a> the following and it has not been amended since:</p>
<p>That the Supreme Court of the United States shall hereafter consist of the Chief Justice of the United States and eight associate justices, any six of whom shall constitute a quorum</p>
<p>Second, the last attempt to increase the number of Supreme Court justices came from President Franklin Roosevelt in an <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/when-franklin-roosevelt-clashed-with-the-supreme-court-and-lost-78497994/" type="external">attempt to pack the court</a> in response to the Court's continuous rejection of his unconstitutional New Deal laws. That was seen as a considerable constitutional crisis where FDR intended to use the legislature to force his agenda down the throat of the judiciary.</p>
<p>Third, Udall's stroke of "genius" only represents a final attempt to bring another judicial <a href="https://www.conservativereview.com/commentary/2016/03/judge-merrick-garland-a-moderate-a-centrist-not-hardly" type="external">"moderate"</a> into the Supreme Court to undermine conservatives' hopes of putting additional originalists on the bench. Obama and the Democratic Party lost their privilege to nominate Supreme Court justices and federal judgeships the moment Donald Trump swore his oath to the Constitution on January 20, 2017.</p>
<p>Fourth, and far more substantially, it justifies giving the President power to force the resignation of a Supreme Court justice in order to promulgate an agenda. It was an issue when FDR, Lyndon Johnson, or Richard Nixon attempted to do so during their respective presidencies and it should not be a normalized practice under Trump or any other administration. It is also a gross abuse of power for the executive to directly toy with the make-up of the judiciary to ensure that the Court may rule in his favor in the event of constitutional misconduct.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Udall believes that any "true" attempt to unite the country surrounds the nomination and the confirmation of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court even if it violates nearly 150 years of precedent and if it means undermining the will of the American people <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/poll-majority-of-americans-want-supreme-court-to-interpret-the-constitution-as-originally-written/article/2611261?custom_click=rss" type="external">who want to see more originalists on the Supreme Court</a>. Such pie-in-the-sky thinking completely ignores the laws of the land, undermines the judiciary, and presents itself as the last act of desperation of a party that refuses to accept that Obama is no longer the President of the United States.</p>
<p>Politico also stipulated the following for Udall's radically moronic idea:</p>
<p>Udall?s proposal also mirrors an episode from the fifth season of ?The West Wing,? when staffers for fictional President Jed Bartlet ? faced with a high court vacancy following the death of an associate justice ? persuade the show?s chief justice to also resign so Bartlet could announce a pair of nominees who wouldn?t change the ideological balance of the court.</p>
<p>As if anything that comes out of a fictional television show should act as basis for real-life policy.</p>
<p>You cannot make this stuff up.</p>

<article id="0000438" published-at="2014-09-10" title="IRS to audit Breitbart News Network; Ted Cruz smells a rat"><p>The late Andrew Breitbart Photo: <a href="" type="external">impliedinference.wordpress.com</a></p>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service wants to audit the conservative-leaning Breitbart News Network, who vows not to be silenced.</p>
<p>Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has asked Commissioner John Koskinen to explain the decision, given its obvious political overtones and possible partisan implications.</p>
<p>In a letter posted on his <a href="http://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;amp;id=1708" type="external">congressional website</a>Tuesday, Cruz posited a series of tough questions to Koskinen including:</p>
<p>The executive chairman of Breitbart News, Stephen Bannon, said in a written statement, ?The Obama administration?s timing on this is exquisite, but try as they might through various methods to silence us, we will only get more emboldened.?</p>
<p>This sentiment was echoed by the president and CEO of Breitbart, Larry Solov, who said. ?We stand ready to cooperate with the Internal Revenue Service on its audit of our company, but this will not deter us in the least from continuing our aggressive coverage of this president or his administration,? according to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2014/09/09/breitbart-news-says-irs-targeted-company-for-audit/" type="external">Fox News</a>.</p>
<p>The scandal-plagued federal agency would not comment on the publicity claiming privacy laws, but its copious demand for minutiae from the news organization, to include ?a written narrative? of the business, has raised red flags across the conservative spectrum.</p>

<article id="0000440" published-at="2016-07-08" title="READ: Moving Statement From Dallas PD Chief: 'We Don't Feel Much Support Most Days'"><p>After the murderous assault on Dallas police officers on Thursday night in which five policemen were slain and six others wounded, Dallas Police Chief David Brown issued a brief, eloquent statement:</p>
<p>Dallas Police Chief David Brown: <a href="https://t.co/gbG3UfPlGw" type="external">pic.twitter.com/gbG3UfPlGw</a></p>
<p>Brown, who began his tenure as police chief in 2010, is no stranger to tragedy, as The Washington Post reports. Brown?s son David was 27 in 2010 when he shot 23-year-old Jeremy McMillian as he drove through Lancaster with his girlfriend and two children in the car. Lancaster police officer Craig Shaw, 37, responding to the incident, was shot and killed by Brown.</p>
<p>David Brown, the father, told his department at the time, ?The past few days have been very troubling and emotional for all of us. My family has not only lost a son, but a fellow police officer and a private citizen lost their lives at the hands of our son. That hurts so deeply I cannot adequately express the sadness I feel inside my heart.?</p>
<p>Before that, in August 1988, Brown?s former partner, Walter Williams, 47, who had been Brown?s classmate at the police academy was killed in the line of duty. Brown told the <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/dallas/headlines/20100522-Dallas-Police-Chief-David-Brown-is-1862.ece" type="external">Dallas Morning News</a> in 2010, ?When things like that happen and you?re really close, you don?t believe it for the longest time. I really relate to all of those in-the-line-of-duty deaths [on a] much more personal level?.?.?. you lose a partner, you just never get over it.?</p>
<p>In 1991, Brown?s younger brother Kelvin was killed by drug dealers.</p>
<p>?I can?t deny that?s a part of who I am,? Brown had told the Morning News in 2010. ?The families of victims, I know what they go through.?</p></article>
<article id="0000443" published-at="2017-03-17" title="Here's the Average Net Worth in the United States"><p></p>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau regularly conducts a survey of income and program participation that offers insight into Americans' financial well-being. Earlier this month, the Census Bureau updated the public on changes it has made to improve the survey's results, and in that report, it included intriguing new insight into Americans' net worth. Specifically, U.S. households' median net worth reached $80,039 in 2013. Are you keeping pace?</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>The Census Bureau's estimate of household net worth comes from its 2014 survey, which reflects changes that more accurately show where net worth is coming from. The 2014 survey now includes questions on subjects such as annuities, passive business ownership, education savings accounts, and the cash value of life insurance. According to the Census Bureau, without including these new questions, the median net worth of households could have been reported to be as low as $74,083.</p>
<p>Image source: Getty Images.</p>
<p>The biggest contributor to Americans' net worth is home equity. Overall, 63% of the survey's respondents say they have equity in their home, and the bureau reports that, across all respondents, equity represents about one-third of the median $80,039 in net worth.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>If you're a home owner, and you're curious how your equity compares to that of other homeowners, the median value of home equity that was reported was $81,000.</p>
<p>A 401(k) plan or a thrift savings plan, a type of defined contribution plan that's offered to government employees, was the second-biggest contributor to U.S. household net worth. Overall, 40.7% of respondents say they have one of those plans, and that the median value of their account is $46,000.</p>
<p>Individual retirement accounts and Keogh accounts are also popular, with 28% of people surveyed saying they have one, with a median balance of $40,000.</p>
<p>Americans' assets also commonly include the cash value of a life insurance plan, and stocks or mutual funds. About 19% of people report a median $12,000 in cash value of life insurance, and 20% say they have a median $32,500 in stocks or mutual funds.</p>
<p>Student loans and credit card debt were the biggest unsecured liabilities weighing down net worth. Mortgages and auto loans were included in the asset column, because on average, home and car owners reported having equity in them.</p>
<p>More than half of households owe debt that is unsecured by collateral, and over 40% report owing money on credit cards and store bills. The median amount that's owed on credit cards is only $3,000, so student loans that are the biggest drag on U.S. net worth. Almost 20% of Americans owe a median $18,000 in student loans or other education-related debt.</p>
<p>Americans' biggest assets are their home and retirement plans, so if you're on the fence about buying a home, or increasing your contribution rate to your 401(k) plan, those two moves could be your best options for increasing net worth over time.</p>
<p>If you already own your home, making an additional mortgage payment every year can help you quickly build up home equity, and it can save you thousands of dollars in interest payments at the same time. A smart and budget-friendly way to increase your contributions to your 401(k) is to boost your contribution annually by the amount of your pay raise.</p>
<p>On the liabilities side of your ledger, revolving credit card debt is a big no-no because credit card interest rates can be high, and money that's used to make monthly credit card payments can be better used if it's invested in your IRA.</p>
<p>Overall, set reasonable goals for increasing your net worth, and check in annually on your progress toward those goals. Remember, however, that most of your net worth comes from homes and investments, and returns on those assets can vary widely in the short term, so make sure you set your goals with a long-term mindset.</p>

<article id="0000447" published-at="2004-12-20" title="Chinese Strikers Use Weblogs for Their Struggle"><p>Labor unrest is increasingly hitting the economy as migrant workers would rather stay at home and work in the booming agriculture sector. Especially southern China has been hit by a shortage of labor that has made it easier for disgruntled workers to get into action. Ten days ago the 12, 000 workers of a Wal-Mart supplier, a sino-Japanese joint venture walked out. Interesting detail of the story, writen by <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/12/16/news/china.html" type="external">Howard</a> <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/12/16/news/china.html" type="external">French</a> of the New York Times, was that the workers, banned from organizing themselves, used <a href="http://www.chinaherald.net/2004/12/labor-emerging-call-for-real-trade.html" type="external">SMS-messages</a> to stay in touch with each other.Now also <a href="http://www.blogcn.com/user24/unidenppl/index.html" type="external">a weblog</a> has emerged, maintained by the strikers, <a href="http://www.isaacmao.com/meta/2004/12/shenzhen-16000-workers-in.html" type="external">reports blogger</a> Isaac Mao.

<article id="0000448" published-at="2016-06-03" title="Following a House Fire, Everyone Perishes Except For Trump Supporters: Here?s Why"><p>There is a hilarious joke making its rounds across the internet, sure to&amp;#160;put a smile on the faces of&amp;#160;all the Trump supporters out there. DISCLAIMER: If you?re a Bernie or Hillary fan, you might want to find a different site to follow because here at Fury News, WE DESTROY LIBERALS! Ok?now back to the joke:</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, California, a house shared by 3 families was tragically destroyed by a fire.&amp;#160;A family of illegal Mexicans (who were die-hard Bernie Sanders supporters) lived on the first floor, and sadly, all perished in the fire.</p>
<p>On the second floor lived a family of lslamic refugees, who were all huge Hillary supporters. They too tragically lost their lives in the fire.</p>
<p>On the third floor of the home is where a&amp;#160;white couple lived, who were Donald Trump supporters.&amp;#160;They managed to survive the fire however.</p>
<p>Following&amp;#160;the tragic event,&amp;#160;the liberal press caught wind of the story, and immediately&amp;#160;went into a frenzy. Al Sharpton, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders all flew into LA and met with the Fire Chief, demanding an explanation as to why all&amp;#160;the minority Democrats died, while the white Republican couple survived.</p>

<article id="0000449" published-at="2018-12-20" title="Raft of new state laws are going ? or have gone ? into effect"><p>SACRAMENTO ?&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/home.php" type="external">California Gov. Jerry Brown</a>&amp;#160;signed 898 bills into law last year. Most start on&amp;#160;Jan. 1, but others going into effect in coming years. The majority of new laws deal with minutiae that?s unlikely to affect most residents, but a number of them will have real-world consequences for broad numbers of people ? on issues ranging from new driving rules to patients? access to experimental medications.</p>
<p>Here?s a sampling of some of the significant <a href="http://www.legislature.ca.gov/" type="external">new laws</a> from last session:</p>
<p>Register your ammo purchases: Californian gun owners will need to deal with a variety of new gun-control limitations after the governor signed a broad package of bills ? and voters approved Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom?s gun-control initiative on Nov. 8. The most potentially far reaching effects will come from the state?s approval of Proposition 63, which has <a href="http://bearingarms.com/erika-h/2016/11/11/california-approved-proposition-63-gun-rights-groups-ready-take-action/" type="external">various restrictions and a roll-out of implementation dates over a few years</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-california-lawmakers-send-broad-package-1467318789-htmlstory.html" type="external">Beginning July 1, 2017</a>, the state will implement a ban on high-capacity magazines and will require owners to report any lost or stolen weapons. The much-publicized requirement that ammo buyers pass background checks won?t go into effect until Jan. 1, 2018.</p>
<p>Higher minimum wages and more unpaid leave: ?The statewide minimum wage goes from $10 to $10.50 an hour for businesses with 26 or more employees ? a rate that will rise to $15 by 2022,? <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/23/californias-new-laws-in-2017-guns-gender-neutral-bathrooms-and-booze-in-beauty-salons/" type="external">as the Mercury-News explained</a>. That wage hike comes from Senate Bill 3. ?Assembly Bill 2393 gives up to 12 weeks of paid parental leave to all K-12 and community college&amp;#160;employees, including classified workers&amp;#160;and community college faculty,? the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>Restrictions on police use of asset forfeiture: Senate Bill 443 was one of the last bills from last session that the governor signed, but it is widely viewed as one of the most significant changes in state law. Before the new law went into effect, police agencies had the ability to take&amp;#160;the cash, cars and even homes from people even if they weren?t convicted of any crime. The authorities needed simply to claim the property was used in the commission of a drug crime. California had fairly tough restrictions in place, but local and state police agencies would partner with federal authorities under the ?equitable sharing? program and then they would operate under looser federal law.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/news/2016/09/california-governor-brown-signs-bill-protecting-californians-civil-asset-forfeiture-abu" type="external">As the Drug Policy Alliance explains</a>, ?Starting on January 1, 2017, California law will require a conviction prior to forfeiture in any state case where the items seized are cash under $40,000 or other property such as homes and vehicles regardless of value.? If local or state agencies work with the feds, they could only share in the proceeds if an underlying conviction were obtained. The final compromise still allows law enforcement to keep proceeds of more than $40,000 in cash only ? a provision which caused major law enforcement groups to drop their opposition.</p>
<p>Higher fees from the DMV ? and more: <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/pubs/newsrel/newsrel16/2016_36" type="external">Two new laws</a> boost the fees for DMV registrations by $10 and for an environmental license plate by the same amount. Another DMV-related law requires drivers to restrain children 2 years or under in a rear-facing car seat unless they weigh 40 pounds or more. Drivers will need to pay attention to a new law dealing with hand-held devices. ?Driving a motor vehicle while holding and operating a handheld wireless telephone or a wireless electronic communications device will be prohibited, unless the device is mounted on a vehicle?s windshield or is mounted/affixed to a vehicle?s dashboard or center console in a manner that does not hinder the driver?s view of the road,? according to the agency.</p>
<p>Gaining the ?right to try?: California became <a href="http://reason.com/blog/2016/09/27/california-becomes-32nd-state-to-pass-ri" type="external">the 32nd state to pass so-called ?right to try? legislation</a>, which allows terminally ill people to try experimental drugs that have yet to pass the federal Food and Drug Administration?s full battery of tests. Supporters argued that many people die while waiting for drugs to clear that long and cumbersome process. After Senate amendments, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1668" type="external">Assembly Bill 1668</a> includes the caveat that ?a health benefit plan, except to the extent the plan provided coverage, is not liable for any outstanding debt related to the treatment or lack of insurance for the treatment.?</p>
<p>Beer and wine at barbershops: <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/15-16/bill/asm/ab_1301-1350/ab_1322_cfa_20160818_011054_asm_floor.html" type="external">Assembly Bill 1322</a> passed overwhelmingly in both houses of the Legislature. This bill allows beauty salons and barber shops to serve their clients limited quantities of beer or wine at no extra charge without obtaining a license or permit from the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control,? according to the Assembly analysis. The new law still allows local governments to impose restrictions on this practice.</p>
<p>Rescuing Fido from a hot car: <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB797" type="external">Assembly Bill 797</a> reduces liability for citizens who break a car window to save an animal that is closed in a hot car ? provided they first try calling the authorities and the authorities haven?t responded quickly enough.</p>
<p>Legalizing lane-splitting: Anyone who drives on California?s vast network of freeways has noticed motorcyclists? habit of ?lane-splitting,? as they drive between the cars that occupy the lanes. The law had required motorcyclists to ride ?as nearly as practical entirely within a single lane,? even though the practice has been widely accepted. Motorcyclists have long argued that this is safer than remaining in one lane and risk being hit from behind. Assembly Bill 51 ?would authorize the Department of the California Highway Patrol to develop educational guidelines relating to lane splitting in a manner that would ensure the safety of the motorcyclist, drivers, and passengers, as specified,? <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/15-16/bill/asm/ab_0051-0100/ab_51_bill_20160819_chaptered.htm" type="external">according to the state Legislative Counsel</a>.</p>
<p>Ignore those juvenile convictions: Assembly Bill 1843 ?Prohibits employers from asking an applicant for employment to disclose information concerning or related to an arrest, detention, processing, diversion, supervision, adjudication, or court disposition that occurred while the person was subject to the process and jurisdiction of juvenile court law, or seek or utilize any such information as a factor in determining any condition of employment,? according to the Assembly analysis. This was a contentious issue that passed on largely partisan lines (Democrats supported; Republicans opposed) given business-community concerns about their ability to screen job applicants.</p>
<p>You must be 21 to smoke or vape: Earlier in the year, the governor signed a package of smoking bills that, most significantly, raises the smoking age to 21. It also raised the age for vaping to 21. That last provision was particularly controversial because some argue&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/smoking-715870-tobacco-vaping.html" type="external">e-cigarettes are a&amp;#160;safer way for smokers to break their dangerous habit</a>. Those laws went into effect in June.</p>
<p>Offering showers for the homeless: <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1995" type="external">Assembly Bill 1995</a> would require community colleges that have shower facilities to allow enrolled homeless students to use those showers.</p>
<p>More bathroom choices for the transgendered: California passed a law, <a href="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/15-16/bill/asm/ab_1701-1750/ab_1732_cfa_20160404_222644_asm_comm.html" type="external">Assembly Bill 1772</a>, that requires all businesses and public agencies with single-toilet bathrooms to make them available to people of all genders ? a bill viewed more as a symbolic measure offered in the thick of the national debate over bathrooms for transgendered people.</p>
<p>The new Legislature will be back in full swing <a href="https://caiclac.wordpress.com/2015/12/23/2016-california-legislative-calendar/" type="external">after the new year</a>.</p>

<article id="0000450" published-at="2016-10-04" title="A Compelling Idea Among Commodities"><p>When it comes to commodities, plenty of investors are familiar with gold and oil, but there are times when other, less heralded commodities outperform bullion and crude. Of course, knowing when a particular commodity will fall out of favor and when it will be a leader is difficult.</p>
<p>So there are advantages to a diversified commodities exchange traded fund, such as the WisdomTree Continuous Commodity Index Fund (NYSE:GCC), which tracks the Thomson Reuters Equal Weight Continuous Commodity Total Return Index. An ETF like GCC can be particularly useful during periods of commodities volatility or when the asset class swings between various extremes as it did last month.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>While the overall month was positive, the index was filled with extremes. Lean hogs and feeder cattle are having their 2nd worst months in history, the worst since Dec. 2003 and Aug. 2002, respectively. This drove livestock to return its 7th worst month ever since Dec. 2003 when it lost 15.8%. On the other hand, sugar and lead each posted 11.3% gains this month, said S&amp;amp;P Dow Jones Indices <a href="http://www.indexologyblog.com/2016/10/03/commodities-post-best-september-in-six-years/" type="external">in a recent note Opens a New Window.</a>.</p>
<p>GCC offers investors exposure to seven sub-sets of the commodities space: energy, grains, industrial metals, livestock, natural gas, precious metals and softs. Within the ETF, investors will find familiar fare such as gold, oil and silver along with more obscure commodities, such as cocoa, coffee and a sugar.</p>
<p>Commodities are on pace to have several big winners and losers this year. Thus far gold and zinc are set to have their 3rd best years in history while feeder cattle is set to post its worst year. Below is a table of commodities that are closest to be on pace for record setting years. Although natural gas is having one of its best years, it is still negative it has only ever been positive six times through the year at this point, adds S&amp;amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that it equal weights its lineup, which limits the contributions, negative and positive, an individual commodity makes toward the ETF's performance. Additionally, the ETF's rebalancing frequency ensures commodities that are seeing increases in volatility are limited or pulled from GCC's lineup.</p>

<article id="0000453" published-at="2014-04-23" title="Southern Democrats Hang In There"><p>Hanging in there</p>
<p>After a rough last four or five months for their party, Democrats can feel good about this important midterm development: The vulnerable Southern Senate Democrats are still hanging in there, according to new polling from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/04/23/upshot/24upshot-south-poll.html" type="external">New York Times and the Kaiser Family Foundation</a>. In Arkansas, Sen. Mark Pryor (D-AR) holds a 10-point lead over GOP challenger Tom Cotton, 46%-36%. In Louisiana, Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-LA) is ahead of likely GOP front-runner Bill Cassidy, 42%-18% (the free-for-all November race will go to a December runoff if no one surpasses 50%, so Landrieu?s lead is not as impressive as you might think for now). In North Carolina, Sen. Kay Hagan (D-NC) is up 42%-40% over GOP front-runner Thom Tillis (and up 41%-39% over the other leading GOPer in the race, Greg Brannon). And in Kentucky, it?s Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at 44%, Democrat Alison Grimes at 43%. Perhaps the most important result here are the Arkansas numbers, because they confirm other polling we?ve seen showing Pryor ahead. The poll also shows that North Carolina is headed -- as we?ve said before -- to be this cycle?s true bellwether for Senate control, because it?s truly a ?generic D? vs ?generic R? result. And the poll cements the conventional wisdom that the Kentucky Senate race is a pure toss-up. Of course, these vulnerable Democratic incumbents are below 50% (and Landrieu and Hagan are in the low 40s), so they are still in dangerous territory. But the important news for Democrats is that these races are far from done, meaning that Republicans winning the Senate in November (or December) is far from a sure thing.</p>
<p>The bad news for Democrats: Obama remains a liability in these states</p>
<p>The bad news for Democrats is that President Obama remains a big liability in these Southern races. According to the poll, his approval rating among registered voters is 32% in Kentucky, 33% in Arkansas, 41% in North Carolina, and 42% in Louisiana. Strikingly, however, the Democratic governors in Arkansas and Kentucky are very popular (Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe has a 68% approval rating, and Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear has a 56% rating), while the GOP governors in Louisiana and North Carolina are in rough shape (Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is at 40%, and North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory is at 43%). In fact, don?t be surprised if Dems in Louisiana and North Carolina try and make the Republican governors more of an issue as basically a counterpoint to the president. Still, the other bad news for Democrats is that Republicans have other ways to get to a majority beyond these southern races -- given that they?ve put Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, and New Hampshire into play (or somewhat into play). But with six months to go until Election Day, Democrats can take comfort that no one is going to write off these southern races. And that?s an important victory for them. Already, the GOP thinks it has three pickups on the board (SD, WV, and MT), if the Democrats can keep them from adding any more into their column in this EARLY stage and force them to be competing in a wider playing field for longer, it?s an important development.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_saLrADKqNM" type="external">?For relaxing times, make it Suntory time?</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, President Obama has arrived in Japan -- the first leg of his overseas trip to Asia. At 8:30 pm ET, he participates in an arrival ceremony and holds a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Abe at 11:00 pm ET. Some have dubbed this trip as an effort to ?contain? China. But more than anything else, the trip is about giving love to the United States? leading allies in this region -- Japan and South Korea. Both countries have felt as if the U.S. hasn?t given them the ally love that they deserve, especially as the U.S. moves closer to China. So this trip is about Obama reassuring both key U.S. allies that the U.S. will play favorites in the region on their behalf. And yes, while the U.S. denies it, there is an obvious ?contain China? strategy going on here.</p>
<p>Bob Dole?s tour through Kansas</p>
<p>Don?t miss the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bob-dole-is-back-in-kansas-running-for-nothing-but-running-hard/2014/04/22/21c15ef6-c9eb-11e3-b81a-6fff56bc591e_story.html" type="external">Washington Post?s Dan Balz</a> on Bob Dole?s tour through Kansas, where the 90-year-old former senator and former presidential candidate is thanking his former constituents. ?He is running for nothing but is nonetheless running hard. He made three stops on Monday, four more on Tuesday, including at the Dole Institute, which is named for him, at the University of Kansas here in Lawrence. He has two stops planned for Wednesday. That?s just a warm-up. When he returns next month, he has 16 stops on his schedule? ?I?ve got a 45-year-old-mind trapped in a 90-year-old body,? he joked at the Senior Center in Paola.? Dole on Obama: ??I think President Obama certainly means well,? he said, ?but without being critical ? because I?m not here for that purpose ? I think he needs to get acquainted with more members of Congress. .?.?. You have to get acquainted obviously with your own party, but you?ve got to get acquainted with the other party. All the wisdom doesn?t reside in one party.?? On the partisanship in Washington: ??Some people say ?compromise? is a bad word,? he said. ?That means you must be a liberal. Well, Ronald Reagan told me one day, ?Get me 70 percent and I?ll get the rest next year. .?.?. He was pragmatic ? and he was Mr. Conservative.??</p>
<p>Where the Democrats are fighting back on health care, Part 2</p>
<p>Speaking of Landrieu and her re-election race, she is the latest to use strong language to defend the health-care law she voted for in 2010. ?It?s a solid law that needs improvement,? Landrieu tells the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/04/22/landrieu-ill-put-gop-foe-on-defensive-on-health-care/" type="external">Washington Post?s Greg Sargent</a>. ?My opponent offers nothing but repeal, repeal, and repeal. And even with all the law?s setbacks, we?re seeing benefits for thousands of people in Louisiana.? More from Landrieu: ?I think the benefits that people have received are worth fighting for? I think Bill Cassidy is going to be at a distinct disadvantage. He has insurance, but he?s also denying it to the 242,000 people who fall into the Jindal gap [not expanding Medicaid]. He also wants to take coverage away from tens of thousands who have gotten it for the first time.? Don?t miss Landrieu?s ?Jindal gap? remark when it comes to the GOP governor?s refusal to expand Medicaid. After all, that New York Times/Kaiser poll has Jindal with a lower approval rating among registered voters in Louisiana (40%) than Obama does (42%).</p>
<p>Where the Democrats aren?t fighting back on health care</p>
<p>While Landrieu is defending the health-care law, Democratic Senate candidate Michelle Nunn in Georgia is up with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY5TUd60X7E" type="external">TV ad</a> saying she would eliminate the subsidy that members of Congress get to pay for their health insurance under the health-care law. "It's time Washington worked for us for a change."</p>
<p>Tillis wins last night?s debate ?by default?</p>
<p>Speaking of North Carolina?s Senate race, the Republican vying to challenge Sen. Kay Hagan participated in their first televised debate last night, and the state?s top political writer essentially declared Thom Tillis the winner. The <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/04/22/3803308/christensen-senate-debate-reflects.html#emlnl=Today_at_a_Glance" type="external">Raleigh News &amp;amp; Observer?s Rob Christensen</a>: ?State House Speaker Thom Tillis, who has been leading in the polls and in fundraising, emerged from the debate largely unscathed despite frequent barbs from Cary physician Greg Brannon, his tea party opponent. The other two candidates, Charlotte pastor Mark Harris and Heather Grant, a nurse practitioner in Wilkes County, chose not to engage their opponents in a debate that was surprisingly staid. The winner by default was Tillis, who had the most to risk because he has an extensive public record to defend and only rarely did he have to do so.?</p>
<p>The war over women?s votes</p>
<p>If you want to see how contraception remains a potent issue for Democrats, just check out this new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y11L7Z2A9vs" type="external">TV ad</a> Sen. Mark Udall (D-CO) is running against challenger Rep. Cory Gardner (R-CO). ?Gardner sponsored a bill to make abortion a felony, including cases of rape and incest,? the ad goes. Gardner even championed an eight-year crusade to outlaw birth control. And if you want to see how Republicans are trying to parry the ?war on women? attacks from Democrats, observe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc_AAje-4l0" type="external">this ad</a> by GOP Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land in Michigan, which knocks down the idea she?s anti-woman (after previously saying that women prefer work flexibility to more pay). "Congressman Gary Peters and his buddies want you to believe I'm waging a war on women," she says to the camera and later concludes: "As a woman, I might know a LITTLE bit more about women than [Democrat] Gary Peters."</p>
<p>Clawson wins GOP special primary in Florida</p>
<p>In the special GOP congressional primary in Florida to replace Rep. Trey Radel -- who resigned after being pleading guilty to cocaine-possession charges -- businessman Curt Clawson came out on top and is likely headed to Congress. <a href="http://atr.rollcall.com/self-funding-republican-wins-primary-in-race-to-replace-trey-radel/?dcz=" type="external">Roll Call</a>: ?Clawson won with 38 percent of the vote, with 95 percent of precincts reporting at the time the Associated Press called the race. Finishing behind him were state Senate Majority Leader Lizbeth Benacquisto with 26 percent and state Rep. Paige Kreegel with 25 percent. He will now face Democrat April Freeman in the June 24 special, where Clawson is heavily favored.?</p>
<p>Paul Ryan to meet with Congressional Black Caucus next Wednesday</p>
<p>Fnally, NBC?s Frank Thorp reported that House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI) <a href="" type="internal">will meet with the Congressional Black Caucus</a> (CBC) next Wednesday at noon to discuss the issue of poverty, an aide for the CBC says, a meeting that was set after Ryan's comments about men not working in "inner cities" sparked accusations that the use of the term was racial. "You know, Congressman Ryan is a nice guy, and as such you know he has tried to frame the comments that he made about inner city folk as just sort of an inarticulate way of communicating," Rep Gwen Moore (D-WI) said during a conference call with reporters today. "We want to challenge his assumptions about that and really raise with him a couple of very specific proposals."</p>

<article id="0000454" published-at="2012-09-22" title="Spilled Milk: Homo?s Odyssey"><p>This post is the fourth in a series of&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">Spilled Milk</a>&amp;#160;columns by Emmy Award-winning writer and producer&amp;#160;William Lucas Walker that chronicle his journey through parenthood.&amp;#160;Spilled Milk,&amp;#160;which originates in&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-lucas-walker/" type="external">The Huffington Post</a>, appears on these pages every Saturday.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, our little clan took a road trip from Los Angeles to Portland, Ore. Road trips are one of those mysterious things families feel compelled to do but no one knows why, like camping in the Mojave Desert or supporting the career of Miley Cyrus. I predict in the end it won?t be gay marriage that brings about the destruction of the American family. It will be the road trip.</p>
<p>After getting the kids settled into the back seat of our Honda Odyssey with their DVD players and movies, we hit the freeway. Once out of L.A., I was finally able to sit back, pop open my laptop, and begin jotting down a few ideas for this column. That?s when Kelly woke from his nap and grabbed the steering wheel from me, babbling some nonsense about ?safety? and not using my computer while driving. So we switched seats.</p>
<p>Relocated to the passenger side, ?safely,? I narrowed my list of possible topics to two: ?Surviving Your Child?s K-Mart Taste? and ?Parents I Hate.? Then suddenly ? at 70 miles per hour ? the transmission on our car blew out. And a column was born.</p>
<p>I?m an American, a proud gay American who was raised to believe that bad things don?t happen to Hondas. Yet ours has blown two transmissions in five years.</p>
<p>As we decelerated, the plume of smoke belching from underneath our hood began to panic my unflappable daughter. I tried to calm her as Kelly looked for a place to get off the road. ?Think of it as an adventure, honey! We?re inside a fire-breathing dragon who just lost a leg!? She began to cry.</p>
<p>Somehow we managed to limp across four lanes of traffic to the next exit and turn down a hill into the welcoming parking lot of a visitors center that overlooked a picturesque lake. A visitors center with bathrooms and vending machines and other kids to play with. A visitors center we soon noticed had a chain-link fence around it and a propped-up sign gloating, ?Closed for Renovations.?</p>
<p>?Look, an abandoned castle!? I tried, failing.</p>
<p>We called AAA Roadside Assistance and waited. Turkeys cook faster. An hour and 40 minutes passed as my iPod faded from Gaga to gone and the sun sank deep into the lake. The battery on our cell phone now dead, our world turned pitch black and eerie quiet.</p>
<p>When our Triple-A savior finally arrived on the scene, I could have jumped for joy. Instead, I froze. The white knight who showed up for our rescue turned out to be a physical composite of every high school bully I ever suffered: a tattooed skinhead-type, complete with soul-deadening stare and missing front tooth.</p>
<p>I hesitantly approached the massive flatbed tow truck idling before me and handed up my membership card through the cab window. Barely looking up, he grunted, ?You know we only tow free for seven miles. After that it?s 10 bucks a mile. You got about 15 miles to the next town.? I asked if he could fit a family of four in his cab. His shrug said he?d manage.</p>
<p>After finishing his paperwork in silence, he finally lumbered down from his cab and stopped, getting his first, long look at my family. He stared at Kelly, then at me, then at our kids, finally speaking in the slow, guttural tones of a wife beater:</p>
<p>?These kids y?all?s??</p>
<p>We answered that yes, they were.</p>
<p>Traveling as a two-dad family can have its challenges. Twice a year we visit my parents in South Carolina, a state so welcoming that its constitution bans not only same-sex marriage and civil unions but birth control and bagels. On its face, California might seem an improvement, until you find yourself stranded in the dark off I-5 in one of those counties where Prop 8 passed with 98 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>This man, whom I had now cast as the bastard love child of Ned Beatty and his horny hillbilly in the sequel to Deliverance, stared at us for what seemed a heart-thumping forever. Then he moved off. He spent the next few minutes hauling out huge, heavy chains with giant metal hooks. In my mind I pictured him encircling them around Kelly and me after he?d shot us, to more easily sink us to the bottom of that all-too-convenient lake.</p>
<p>After attaching the giant hooks to our Odyssey ? of course, to complete our family portrait and ensure our suspect status, we were two men driving a minivan ? he moved to the side of his flatbed and began pulling mysterious levers that caused his vehicle to groan as it slowly tipped its flatbed to meet our homosexual automobile.</p>
<p>This was too much for our youngest, James, a boy so Bam-Bam butch that for years we?ve referred to him as God?s joke on the gay daddies. By now he truly was jacked up by the adventure of it all. Biologically drawn to the smell of metal and grease like a moth to a blowtorch, James pushed forward and started peppering our AAA guy with questions: ?Is our car dead?? ?Do you have a bathroom in your truck?? ?Who knocked out your tooth? Was it Batman??</p>
<p>At this point Kelly intervened: ?James, stay back so he can do his work.? Mr. Triple-A stopped what he was doing and looked at us. ?His name?s James? I got a boy named James.? He had six kids, he informed us, all named after famous people in the Bible. Of course you do, I thought. A home movie began unspooling in my mind, starring a toddler Moses and barefoot Bathsheba helping their brother Goliath blow up frogs by sticking firecrackers up their butts.</p>
<p>Then he did something unexpected, something? perfect. This man whose menacing silence and sidelong glances had me rattled took off his work gloves and asked James to hold out his hands. He then began to gently pull the huge, oil-stained gloves over our son?s tiny fingers. Next he asked if James wanted to help him work the levers on the side of the flatbed so that he could haul our minivan up onto the truck. Mute with awe, James could only nod. As the chains grew taut and our car began to make its slow ascent up the ramp, James? eyes widened to the size of the moon that had finally peeked through the clouds overhead.</p>
<p>Before long we were all crowded into the cab of the tow truck for the ride to the nearest town. I never would have thought it possible, but somehow the five of us fit. My family was safe. Jesse ? he had a Biblical name, too ? pulled out his phone and handed it to us so we could see pictures of his family. As the glow from the faces of his wife and kids lit up the inside of the truck, he looked at Kelly and me and said, ?So? did you guys get married when y?all had that little window a few years back, before the Prop 8 thing??</p>
<p>We said that we did. ?That?s good,? he said. ?My mom did, too,? he said. ?She called up me and my brother and sister and told us, ?Me and Maggie?s gonna have a wedding. You got a week and a half to figure out a way to get here.??</p>
<p>From there on out, this man I was so sure I had pegged continued to upend my preconceived notions. When he learned we live in Hollywood, he told us that as a teenager he?d been bused in from the suburbs, commuting 20 hours a week to attend the Hollywood High magnet program in theater arts. Theater arts?</p>
<p>?Yep, it was great. For P.E. we took dance. Spent English readin? Shakespeare. Instead of shop, we built sets for musicals. I loved it.?</p>
<p>He never charged us the $80 he should have for the extra mileage. Instead, he directed us to the one motel in that truck-stop town that had a swimming pool for the kids. Then he advised us which mechanic to see the next morning and which taco stands to avoid. And before lowering our big, gay minivan into the parking lot of the auto shop, he stopped to put his gloves on our daughter so she could work the levers this time, sending her into a spiral of rapture. After that he offered to drive us to our motel.</p>
<p>After we?d said our goodbyes and settled into our room, we made sure to sit the kids down and tell them how lucky our family had been that Jesse was the one sent to help us. Being kids, they got it: somehow the five of us fit.</p>
<p>After Kelly and the kids fell asleep, I got curious and Googled the name Jesse. Turns out it?s Hebrew for ?God?s gift.?</p>

<article id="0000455" published-at="2008-04-26" title="Bush Ready to Stimulate America"><p>President Bush announced that rebate checks will start winging their way to taxpayers as early as Monday, helpfully observing that Americans need a little help paying for necessities like groceries and gas during this economic ?slowdown? ? a slightly different story from his initial justification for this economic stimulus plan, and one that wasn?t lost on his critics.</p>
<p>AP via My Way News:</p>
<p>Democrats said they were glad the rebate checks were about to go out, but suggested that multinational oil companies were not among the businesses the stimulus package was originally designed to help.</p>
<p>[?] House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., agreed that people ?need this rebate to cope with the rising cost of gas and groceries.? She said that, while the rebates would help to get the economy moving, there was a need for a second stimulus package ?and we have begun some conversation with the administration and Republicans.?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As he had earlier in the week, Bush used the word ?slowdown? to describe the state of the economy. He has denied that the nation is in a recession, although many economists say it is.</p>
<p>?It?s obvious our economy is in a slowdown. But, fortunately, we recognized the signs early and took action,? Bush said.</p>

<p>MF Global's collapse and the loss of an estimated $1.6 billion in customer money was triggered by former CEO Jon Corzine's poor management decisions and lax protections for customer funds, a congressional investigation has determined.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>The findings of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight will be spelled out in a report to be released on Thursday.</p>
<p>In a preview of the report, the panel's chairman, Rep. Randy Neugebauer, said on Wednesday the evidence unearthed by the committee puts the blame squarely on Corzine, who has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>"The responsibility for failing to maintain the systems and controls necessary to protect customer funds rests with Corzine," the report says. "This failure represents a dereliction of his duty as MF Global's chairman and CEO."</p>

<article id="0000458" published-at="2011-10-31" title="Reforming Congress Starts Today"><p>Washington is in dire need of reform ? and today No Labels will begin its effort to provide solutions to problems in American government.</p>
<p>No Labels is rolling out a series of congressional reforms over the next two weeks. It will include things like putting the House of Representatives and the Senate in session for three weeks a month and out for one week. This would cut down on transportation of elected officials to and from Washington and synchronize the House of Representatives and Senate schedules, allowing for more collaboration.</p>
<p>Over the next two weeks, we will be sharing one reform a day for your feedback and comments.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.policymic.com/group/showCompetition/id/2164" type="external">Click here to tell us how you would fix the government.</a></p>
<p>We intend to propose real governance reforms that our elected officials can easily vote upon and implement within 24 hours.</p>
<p>After getting your feedback, on December 13 we will officially announce our package of rule reforms. So starting today, we hope you will help us identify the best solutions that the No Labels community can support in 2012 and insist our leaders implement without delay.</p>
<p>America needs action now. Twice in the past three months Americans have counted down to a potential government shutdown. In August, S&amp;amp;P downgraded our long-term credit rating based on skepticism over Washington?s ability to put our fiscal house in order. &amp;#160;It's no wonder only 9 percent of Americans have confidence in Congress to do the people's business.</p>
<p>America?s rising debt is accompanied by a deficit of leadership. Elected officials in Washington understand that government has serious problems, but they are unable to find solutions. Bill after bill is halted by hyper-partisan gridlock, weighed down by meaningless amendments and doomed to never being rationally debated, let alone passed.</p>
<p>When leadership fails, it?s time for ?we the people? to step up. So let?s show our leaders that the left and right don?t have a monopoly on solutions. Let?s show them America?s citizens have answers too.</p></article>

<p>The board of trustees of WMUV received and accepted the report of the ad hoc committee on Dec. 2.</p>
<p>?As a result, we have been focusing on the following areas,? said the statement:</p>

<article id="0000468" published-at="2011-09-13" title="California set to send thousands of female inmates home early"><p>Prison officials in California are set to start sending thousands of female inmates home early.</p>
<p>On Monday, the <a href="http://cdcrtoday.blogspot.com/search?updated-min=2011-01-01T00%3A00%3A00-08%3A00&amp;amp;updated-max=2012-01-01T00%3A00%3A00-08%3A00&amp;amp;max-results=" type="external">California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation</a> (CDCR) announced the implementation of the Alternative Custody Program (ACP), which is "aimed at reuniting low-level offenders with their families and providing inmates with rehabilitative services within the community."&amp;#160;</p>
<p>?Approximately two-thirds of CDCR?s female inmates are mothers whose children are either with relatives or are in foster care,? CDCR Secretary Matthew Cate said in a statement. ?ACP is a step in breaking the intergenerational cycle of incarceration, as family involvement is one of the biggest indicators of an inmate?s rehabilitation.?</p>
<p>According to the Los Angeles Times, the move will also help the state meet a court-ordered deadline to make space in its <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-prison-home-20110913,0,6210913.story" type="external">crowded prisons</a>. From the Times:</p>
<p>Mothers who were convicted of non-serious, non-sexual crimes ? and have two years or less remaining on their sentences ? could start going home as early as next week, prisons spokeswoman Dana Toyama said. The women would be required to wear GPS-enabled ankle bracelets and report to parole officers.</p>
<p>The CDCR said in its announcement that 45 percent of the state's female inmates are potentially available for the ACP, but approval will depend on individual reviews. Sex-offense convictions, escapes in the last 10 years and gang membership are among the exclusionary criteria outlined by the CDCR. The program is open only to female inmates for now, but could be opened up to male inmates in the future.</p>
<p>ACP is expected to save California $6 million next year.</p>
<p>The Times spoke with several critics of the program.</p>
<p>"If they were such great mothers to begin with, they never would have committed the heinous crime that got them sent to state prison," Harriet Salarno, founder of Sacramento-based Crime Victims United, told the paper.</p>
<p>CNN reports that <a href="http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/13/california-may-send-thousands-of-female-prisoners-home/?hpt=hp_t2" type="external">California</a> has the nation's largest prison system. In April, Governor Jerry Brown signed a law that aims to reduce prison crowding by moving 33,000 low-level offenders to county jails.</p></article>
<article id="0000473" title="Dianne Feinstein Admits It: No Law Would Have Stopped Las Vegas Gunman"><p>The best sixth man playing for the National Rifle Association is a Democratic senator from California named Dianne Feinstein. Does that surprise you? It shouldn?t.</p>
<p>(Despite the fact that liberals far and wide are calling for greater gun control in the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting, where Stephen Paddock open fired into a crowd of thousands attending a country music concert and killed 58 individuals, injuring over 500 more.)</p>
<p>Indeed, Senator Dianne Feinstein shared in an interview on Sunday, October 8th that no legislation could have stopped Stephen Paddock from committing his horrific acts. She straight up admitted the truth about gun control laws. Who could have predicted that?</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/354440-feinstein-no-law-would-have-stopped-las-vegas-gunman" type="external">The Hill</a>:</p>
<p>Feinstein spoke on CBS News?s ?Face the Nation? about gun legislation in the wake of the attack launched from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel targeting a country music concert.</p>
<p>?Could there have been any law passed that would?ve stopped him?? Host John Dickerson asked the senator.</p>
<p>?No, he passed background checks registering for handguns and other weapons on multiple occasions,? Feinstein replied.</p>
<p>Feinstein?s remark comes as Republicans have started to express interest in a conversation about regulations for bump stock devices, which were found in the hotel room of the suspected gunman. The devices increase the possible rate of gun fire on semi-automatic weapons.</p>
<p>Soooo?.I?m confused Feinstein.</p>
<p>Either legislation helps stop crime, stop tragic shootings, stop criminals, stop evil individuals like Stephen Paddock?and, hence, that is why we should pass further legislation? OR laws don?t stop anyone or anything?</p>
<p>And, if that is the case, we are busying ourselves to pass more legislation. Because it won?t change a darn thing.</p>
<p>But to say legislation doesn?t change anything and to push for legislation? That is just darn confusing, confounding, and, well, Californian.</p>
<p>It is like <a href="" type="internal">Trey Gowdy</a> told <a href="https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/" type="external">Louder with Crowder</a>:</p>
<p>We already have controls on what kind of guns you can have, where you can have them, when you can use them and what individuals can possess even a single bullet. So the question to me is whether or not current controls are adequate and there are two fundamental questions that you should put your finger on. What law had it existed at the time would have prevented this mass killing or another mass killing. What law, but for its lack of implementation could have prevented this. That?s one question. The other question is, among all the panoply of current gun laws, how are we doing enforcing them??</p>
<p>Are we even enforcing the current laws? And, if we are, and that STILL isn?t doing anything?why, oh why, are we creating more laws?</p>
<p>We are barking up the absolute wrong tree. Liberals want to DO something. They want to respond with something.</p>
<p>But all they are doing is moving. They aren?t actually making any progress. They?re busying their minds, their state legislatures, the halls of the U.S. Capitol. And that makes them feel better, like they are taking some moral stand.</p>
<p>Like somehow movement equals progress or a solution.</p>
<p>But it really doesn?t, because anything they try to come up with is not going to stop these things. Attacking inanimate objects is not a legitimate solution to the problem of mass shootings.</p>
<p>Liberals want to frame conservative legislators lack of action as inhumane, cruel, or cold but, instead, it is simply a pragmatic talking point.</p>
<p>The reason why ALL legislators aren?t calling for greater gun control legislation is because it doesn?t work (not to mention that our right of self-defense is not abrogated by unlawful usage of firearms).</p>
<p>Period.</p>
<p>Feinstein even admitted as much herself.</p></article>
<article id="0000474" published-at="2016-04-11" title="Required Minimum Distributions -- Common Questions About IRA Accounts"><p>Every year, around tax time, FINRA receives questions from investors about required minimum distributions, or RMDs. In a nutshell, an RMD is the amount you must take out of your traditional retirement savings plan to avoid tax penalties, once you've reached the mandatory age for making withdrawals, usually 70 1/2.</p>
<p>We are issuing this alert to provide basic information about RMDs, and to provide answers to a number of common RMD questions. We focus on RMDs from traditional IRAs because these are the type of retirement accounts where individuals are directly responsible for computing required minimum distributions.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>Common IRA-related RMD questionsRMD rules can be complex, especially with respect to <a href="https://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Required-Minimum-Distributions-for-IRA-Beneficiaries" type="external">beneficiary distributions Opens a New Window.</a> and the correction of miscalculations or missed RMD obligations. For this reason, you may want to consult with a tax professional, especially if this is the first time you are taking a distribution.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some of the most common RMD questions related to IRAs have fairly clear-cut answers. Here are some answers to frequently asked questions:</p>
<p>1. What are required minimum distributions? RMDs are minimum amounts that you must withdraw annually from your traditional IRA, 401(k), 403(b), or other retirement savings plan once you've reached the mandatory age for making withdrawals. For traditional IRAs, IRS rules mandate that you take your first RMD by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you reach 70 1/2 years of age. For each subsequent year after you begin taking RMDs, you must withdraw your RMD by Dec. 31. Note that the amounts you withdraw typically count as taxable income unless you already paid taxes on your contributions.</p>
<p>Example: You turned 70 1/2 on July 15, 2015. That means you must take your first RMD (for tax year 2015) by April 1, 2016. You must take your second RMD, for 2016, by Dec. 31, 2016, and your third RMD, for 2017, by Dec. 31, 2017 -- and so on. If you prefer not to take two RMDs during 2016, the IRS will allow you to take your first RMD before Dec. 31, 2015.</p>
<p>2. How do I calculate the RMD?The RMD for any given year is the total account balance in your IRA, or IRAs, as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year divided by a distribution period. You can find the distribution period using the IRS's <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/uniform_rmd_wksht.pdf" type="external">Joint Life and Last Survivor Expectancy Worksheet Opens a New Window.</a> if your spouse is the sole beneficiary and is more than 10 years younger than you, or the <a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b/index.html#en_US_2014_publink1000231236" type="external">Uniform Lifetime Worksheet Opens a New Window.</a> for all other IRA owners.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Example: You are 72 years old in 2016, and your wife is not more than 10 years younger than you. To figure out your RMD for this year (2016), divide the value of each IRA you own as of Dec. 31 of last year (2015) by the distribution figure found in the appropriate IRS worksheet referenced above. For instance, if an IRA amount at the end of 2015 is $100,000, you would divide $100,000 by 25.6 (which comes from the IRS Uniform Lifetime Worksheet), for an RMD for that IRA of $3,906.25.</p>
<p>3. What if I don't take any distributions, or if the distributions I take do not meet the RMD amount? You may have to pay a 50% excise tax on the amount not distributed.</p>
<p>4. Can I withdraw more than the minimum required amount? Yes. However, be aware that the amount of your RMD, as well as any amount that exceeds the RMD, will be considered taxable income except for any part that was taxed before or that can be received tax-free (such as qualified distributions from designated Roth accounts).</p>
<p>5. If I do take more than the minimum amount, can a distribution in excess of the RMD for one year be applied to the RMD for a future year? No.</p>
<p>6. Can I just take the RMD from one account instead of separately from each account? This one's a little tricky. If you are a traditional IRA owner, you must calculate the RMD separately for each traditional IRA that you own but can withdraw the total amount from one or more of the IRAs. Similarly, a 403(b) contract owner must calculate the RMD separately for each 403(b) contract that he or she owns but can take the total amount from one or more of the 403(b) contracts. However, RMDs required from other types of retirement plans, such as 401(k) and 457(b) plans, must be taken separately from each of those plan accounts.</p>
<p>7. What happens if a retirement plan account owner or IRA owner dies before RMDs have begun? Generally, the entire amount of the owner's benefit must be distributed to the beneficiary who is an individual either (1) within five years of the owner's death, or (2) over the life of the beneficiary starting no later than one year following the owner's death. See <a href="https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590b/index.html" type="external">IRS Publication 590-B Opens a New Window.</a>, "Distributions From Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs)," for complete details on when beneficiaries must start receiving RMDs and use the Single Life Expectancy Table found in the publication to compute amount owed.</p>
<p>8. Do I have to take an RMD if I own an annuity? The answer depends on the type of annuity you own. If you own a variable annuity, and it is held in an IRA, the answer is yes. This is referred to as a "qualified annuity" by the IRS, meaning that it likely was funded with pre-tax money that requires you to pay taxes on your withdrawals, as well as take RMDs. Non-qualified annuity contracts offer tax-deferred growth of after-tax funds; they are taxed when annuitized, but as a general rule are not subject to RMDs. (For tax treatment of qualifying longevity annuity contracts (QLACs), see the IRS Bulletin on <a href="https://www.irs.gov/irb/2014-30_IRB/ar07.html" type="external">longevity annuities Opens a New Window.</a>.)</p>
<p>9. What reporting obligations does my brokerage firm have with respect to RMDs? Unlike <a href="https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&amp;amp;-Self-Employed/Cost-Basis-Reporting-FAQs" type="external">cost basis reporting Opens a New Window.</a>, where the IRS requires brokerage firms and other financial institutions to provide investors with certain information, there are no formal RMD reporting obligations placed upon brokerage firms. As a service to customers, brokerage firms may provide RMD computations. But mistakes can be made, and investors should carefully double-check any brokerage firm's RMD computation using the IRS's <a href="https://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/Plan-Participant,-Employee/Required-Minimum-Distribution-Worksheets" type="external">RMD worksheets Opens a New Window.</a>. Tools such as FINRA's <a href="http://apps.finra.org/Calcs/1/RMD" type="external">RMD Calculator Opens a New Window.</a> can also be helpful, as can the assistance of a tax professional.</p>
<p>One thing the IRS makes very clear is that RMD calculations are ultimately the taxpayer's responsibility, so don't rely blindly on calculations by your IRA custodian or retirement plan administrator.</p>
<p>10. What if a mistake is made? All is not lost if you or someone you entrust to do your RMD calculations makes a mistake. In one of its FAQs, the IRS states that penalties "may be waived if the account owner establishes that the shortfall in distributions was due to reasonable error and that reasonable steps are being taken to remedy the shortfall." In order to qualify for this relief, you must file <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5329.pdf" type="external">Form 5329 Opens a New Window.</a> and attach a letter of explanation.</p>

<article id="0000476" published-at="2007-11-28" title="Separate and Unequal in Palestine"><p>On the eve of the meeting intended to restart negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians at Annapolis, Maryland, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert announced that Israel will build no new West Bank settlements, but will not ?strangle? existing Israel settlements. This means that construction in the 149 existing Israeli settlements throughout the West Bank that are strangling Palestinians, including the settlements on our village?s land, will continue unchecked. Olmert?s cynical announcement underlines our fear that Israel, with US support, will insist on retaining most West Bank settlements in the upcoming negotiations, locking Palestinians into a ?separate but unequal? position.</p>
<p>When United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice?s visited the Middle East a few weeks ago, people from our small village of Bil?in joined neighboring villages to send her a message. We protested peacefully against a West Bank highway near us that is reserved for Jewish Israeli settlers, and off-limits to Palestinians, though it was built on Palestinian land. Our banner read: ?Condi, What would Rosa Parks do??</p>
<p>We know that Dr. Rice experienced the bitter taste of discrimination growing up in the South during the US civil rights struggle. In Bil?in, we?ve drawn inspiration from the US civil rights movement as we?ve carried out a three year nonviolent resistance campaign against the discriminatory policies of Israel?s military occupation.</p>
<p>We share Dr. Rice?s admiration for the courage of Rosa Parks who was arrested in Alabama, Rice?s home state, for refusing to give her bus seat to a white man. As Palestinians we aren?t even allowed in buses on many roads in our own country, because 200 miles of the best West Bank roads are reserved for Israeli Jewish settlers.1 The color of Palestinian license plates is different from the licenses of Israelis. Palestinian plates are not allowed on most of the highways crisscrossing the West Bank, many of which were built with US government funding. Palestinians have been banned for five years now from Highway 443 where we protested.</p>
<p>According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), there are 561 physical obstacles and checkpoints inside the West Bank restricting Palestinian movement within the West Bank2, in comparison with only eight checkpoints which separate the West Bank from Israel proper. Nearly all the obstacles and checkpoints are located along the West Bank roads reserved for Israelis. This makes getting to the hospital, school and work or visiting relatives painstakingly difficult or impossible for us. This fragmentation of the West Bank has devastated our economy.</p>
<p>For Palestinians, accepting a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on just 22% of our historic homeland was already a dramatic compromise. But President Bush promised Israel in 2004 that in any negotiated agreement with the Palestinians Israel would retain its ?already existing major population centers? in the West Bank.</p>
<p>However, all Israeli settlements are illegal under international law. By annexing to Israel strategically located clusters of settlements, or ?settlement blocs?, and their highways which carve Palestinian areas into isolated enclaves, Israel will gain permanent control of our movement, borders, water, and cut us off from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The Israeli organization Peace Now reported a few weeks ago that the population growth rate in the settlements is three times the growth rate within Israel.3 We?re experiencing such rapid settlement construction around Bil?in and throughout the West Bank that I can?t even find an accurate map of the West Bank for my son.</p>
<p>In 2001, Israeli developers began building settlement homes on land seized from Bil?in, calling them a neighborhood of the Modi?in Illit settlement bloc. Four years later, Israel?s segregation wall separated Bil?in from 50% of our agricultural land under the pretext of protecting this new settlement. In response, we held over 200 nonviolent protests together with Israeli and international supporters.</p>
<p>Hundreds of us were injured and arrested. After our protests, Israel?s Supreme Court ruled that the wall?s route in Bil?in must be changed to return around half of our seized land. Though we celebrated this success, Israel continues to build on our land that wasn?t returned and plans to annex it as part of the Modi?in Illit settlement bloc.4</p>
<p>Israel has already de facto annexed the 10.2% of the West Bank that lies between the Green Line and the segregation wall, including the major settlement blocs and 80% of Israel?s 450,000 settlers. The segregation wall, settlements and settlement roads carve Palestinian areas into isolated enclaves.</p>
<p>We pray that our children will not spend their lives under Israeli military occupation. We hope that the Annapolis meeting will bring our dreams of freedom closer to fulfillment. But we are concerned that if Israel is allowed to keep most of its settlements and the roads that connect them, then the existing system of ?separate but unequal? will be cemented in place in a Palestinian state.</p>
<p>MOHAMMED KHATIB is a leading member of Bilin?s Popular Committee Against the Wall and the secretary of its village council.</p>

<article id="0000481" published-at="2012-05-18" title="Moody's Downgrades Spanish Banks"><p>President Obama is hosting two big summits this weekend. There's the NATO summit in Chicago, but first he welcomes the leaders of the "Group of 8"? biggest industrialized nations to Camp David.</p>
<p>Europe's economic crisis in Europe is likely to be front and center at the G8, especially fears that Greece may be on the verge of pulling out of the eurozone.</p>
<p>Perhaps no one is watching Greece with as much worry as the Spanish.</p>
<p>Spain's economy is in big trouble, with 25 percent unemployment and a crippled banking sector. Spain's worry is that if Athens leaves the eurozone, investors could lose faith in Madrid as well, and put their money elsewhere.</p>
<p>Spain's stock market plummeted this week as its major banks got bailed out again, and downgraded by a ratings agency.</p>
<p>One bank in particular is at the heart of the storm ? Bankia. It's a merger of five smaller banks. Bankia, which went public last year, was meant to symbolize a reinvigorated banking sector. This week, the government had to come to its rescue with $10 billion.</p>
<p>The bailout, plus a rumor of a run on the bank, sent Bankia's stock price plunging. Spain's Secretary of State for the Economy Cristobal Montoro went on TV this week to urge Spaniards not to panic. He said Bankia was solvent, as was the entire banking sector.</p>
<p>"Spanish banks are not going to suddenly freeze people's accounts,"? Montoro said. "The banks are not going to withhold your savings."?</p>
<p>But Montoro's assurances didn't stop one woman from confronting him Friday, outside his office in Madrid. The exchange was caught on TV. Bankia isn't going under, is it? the distraught woman asked. No need to worry, Montoro said.</p>
<p>The woman shot back that if the bank goes down with her money, she'll kill someone.</p>
<p>Spanish banks have been in trouble for more than three years now. They were caught in a spectacular housing crash that's left them with tens of billions of dollars in bad loans and defaults.</p>
<p>Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced this week a fourth bank bail-out, worth some $30 billion. But at least one ratings agency, Moody's, sees the move as insufficient. On Friday, it downgraded 16 Spanish banks.</p>
<p>On the eve of the G8 Summit, Prime Minister Rajoy said Spain has done all that it can to help its banks, and he demanded the European Union be ready to help, if needed.</p>
<p>"The situation is very difficult and complicated,"? he told reporters. "Our borrowing rates are soaring and that means it is becoming very hard to finance the government."?</p>
<p>By EU, Rajoy was referring to Germany, by far the biggest payer into the European Central Bank. But German Chancellor Angela Merkel hasn't signaled any change in her position, that budget cuts, not bail-outs, are the way to heal Europe's weak economies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Spaniards are getting nervous with the seemingly endless bad economic news ? nervous and disillusioned, says Gayle Allard, an economist at the IE Business school in Madrid.</p>
<p>"When they came into the euro, the Spaniards were so proud to make it in, and I think it was like, okay, we've arrived,"? Allard said. "Now we're here and this is the rest of our lives. There was never any questioning that this a good thing for Spain, and that it was a permanent thing for Spain. And to shake that up it just puts cracks in the project, that I don't know how you'd repair them."?</p>
<p>Cracks in the faith of investors who lend Spain money, but also among Spaniards themselves, according to economist Pablo Triana. He says a Greek exit from the euro might tip the balance here.</p>
<p>"I think there is lot of people in Spain, if Greece were to exit, they would be emboldened to demand similar action,"? Triana said.</p>
<p>In other words, voters in Spain might follow Greece's lead, electing leaders willing to oppose austerity measures, even if that means a return to the peseta ? or people might make a real run on their banks.</p>
<p>Shares in Bankia, by the way, rebounded Friday, after rumors of a run on it were dispelled. But the plunge was an indication of how jittery investors are.</p>
<p>In the U.S., officials and some economists have been urging Europe to spend its way out of the crisis ? stimulate the economy, rather than strangle it, goes the thinking. Because you can only pay debt off if your economy is growing.</p>
<p>That's likely to be part of the message President Obama gives to visiting European heads of state at the Camp David summit this weekend.</p></article>
<article id="0000483" published-at="2008-10-24" title="Chinese American voters"><p>(Why are there so many undecided Chinese American voters?) This election started off as a rift between the younger generation, who overwhelmingly supported Obama, and the older generation of basically die hard Hillary Clinton fans. The younger generation is making huge efforts to convert their parents to Obama. (And what is said in those conversations?) Many older gen voters, even though they're Democrats, they don't know much about Obama. The young Chinese Democrats are so adamant about Obama, so they're pushing their parents to reconsider their viewpoints. (What kind of people are these parents usually?) Well take this family???the father is an immigrant voter, but educated, works in the computer industry. He said his high school age son is a window through which he looks at American politics. He says we're not 100% assimilated into America and American politics. He says there are many things he hopes to learn from young Americans, and his son is the young American he knows best. (What about McCain, why don't more Chinese Americans support him?) Well they do, and many undecided voters are still waiting for McCain to do something that will count the final vote for him. In this community, they revere his experience which comes from his age, but they still worry a bit. I talked to one family, and the son has always supported Obama. His father supports McCain, and has always been a Republican. When the son talks with his father, he brings up the issue of McCain's age. (So what happened with this family?) the son ended up persuading the father to vote for Obama. (Is race a factor for older Chinese American voters?) not just for the older ones. Nevertheless, many Chinese American voters have decided not to vote for Obama, and that speaks for itself. So race is and isn't an issue???it's more of a generational issue.</p></article>
<article id="0000484" published-at="2017-03-17" title="Here's How 1 Million Taxpayers Might Lose Out on $1 Billion in Refunds"><p></p>
<p>Most hardworking Americans aren't in the habit of saying no to free money. It's surprising, therefore, to learn that roughly 1 million taxpayers are set to forgo refunds from the 2013 tax year. According to a March 1 statement, the Internal Revenue Service is sitting on as much as $1 billion in total refunds for unfiled 2013 returns. If you're among the million Americans who stand to collect, now's the time to get that old return in -- before it's too late.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>Generally speaking, you're supposed to file a tax return each year in time for the deadline, which, for 2017, is April 18. (Yes, you get a few extra days this year.) That said, you technically have a three-year window to claim a refund, which means that if you've yet to file your 2013 return, you still have over a month to do so. Once that April 18 deadline passes, however, you'll no longer have an opportunity to get at that money, at which point it will go straight to the U.S. Treasury instead.</p>
<p>IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.</p>
<p>All in, the IRS says it could owe up to $1 billion in total refunds for the 2013 tax year. Though the median estimated refund varies by state, it ranges from $619 in Idaho to $917 in Alaska. (Note that these figures apply to federal, not state, refunds.)</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Now if you're worried that filing your 2013 tax return three years late will result in a penalty that wipes out any potential refund and then some, fear not. There's no penalty for filing a return after the deadline if the IRS owes you money. Rather, it's the opposite situation you need to worry about.</p>
<p>If you owe the IRS money and are late filing your return, you could face a penalty equal to 5% of the taxes you owe for every month your return is late, up to a maximum of 25%. And if you owe money and file your return more than 60 days after the deadline, you'll face a minimum penalty of $135 or 100% of your unpaid tax bill, whichever is smaller. But again, if you're the one who's owed money, you won't be penalized for getting your return in late.</p>
<p>Now keep in mind that if you've also yet to file your 2014 and 2015 returns, your 2013 tax refund may be withheld by the IRS until you get those forms in. Additionally, if you're due a refund from 2013 but owe the IRS money from another tax year, that 2013 refund will first be applied to whatever balance you have outstanding. The same holds true if you're delinquent on a federal student loan or child support payment -- you won't get that money in hand, but instead, it will be used to offset your obligations. But if it's just that 2013 return you neglected to file and you are due a refund, you should have no problems collecting your money in full.</p>
<p>Failing to file a tax return at any time could mean losing out on a pretty sizable refund, and this especially holds true if you're a lower earner. Each year, an estimated 20% of eligible filers miss out on the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which this year could be worth up to $6,318 depending on your earnings and the number of qualifying children in your household.</p>
<p>Back in 2013, the EITC was worth as much as $6,044, and the income thresholds to qualify were as follows:</p>
<p>DATA SOURCE: IRS.</p>
<p>Note that these limits have since increased, which means that if you currently earn slightly more than what you're seeing above, you may still qualify for the 2016 tax year.</p>

<article id="0000487" published-at="2011-11-02" title="Alaa Abd El Fattah: Jailed Egyptian blogger accuses army of abuse"><p>Alaa Abd El Fattah's letter was removed in secret from the Bab El-Khalq prison in Cairo by his wife, Manal Hassan. A <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/nov/02/egypt-revolution-back-mubarak-jails" type="external">full translation</a> is published in the Guardian.</p>
<p>El Fattah describes being held in a cramped cell with eight other men, all of them detained on spurious charges. Some of them claim to have been tortured at the hands of the police.</p>

<p>El Fattah compares the experience to his previous arrests under Hosni Mubarak's dictatorship:</p>
<p>"I never expected to repeat the experience of five years ago: after a revolution that deposed the tyrant, I go back to his jails?"</p>
<p>The only difference, he says, is that the state security prosecutor has been replaced by a military one.</p>

<article id="0000496" title="Rookies &amp; Vets: CARA"><p>Jeremy Long, left, and Robert Treadway, a rookie and vet respectively in CARA. (Photos courtesy the subjects)</p>
<p>Mentoring new members is common in Washington?s LGBT sports leagues and the <a href="http://www.carabowling.org" type="external">Capital Area Rainbowlers Association</a> is no different.</p>
<p>CARA hosts nine fall/winter leagues along with three summer leagues and hosts the annual Capital Halloween Invitational Tournament. This year the tournament celebrates its 35th anniversary.</p>
<p>Jeremy Long enjoyed his time in the D.C. area for an internship and contract work, so he applied for a job in his field of child welfare and moved here in August, 2014.</p>
<p>Originally from Denver, Long grew up playing tennis and competing as a junior cyclist. During his college years, he played club tennis at the University of Northern Colorado.</p>
<p>After arriving in D.C., he did some research on the LGBT sports teams in the area and reached out to the Rainbowlers. He had never been in the sport in an adult league setting and he joined the summer league as a late addition in 2015.</p>
<p>?Bowling is one of the easier sports to pick up as a rookie because there is such diversity in the skill levels,? Long says. ?I found the veterans to be very welcoming and accepting of me. If you are good or bad, you are still a benefit to your team, especially in handicap bowling.?</p>
<p>Long is now in his first fall/winter bowling league and says his teammates are always offering help and tips to develop his skills. He has already competed in the Halloween Invitational and has traveled to Philadelphia and Pittsburgh for tournaments.</p>
<p>Last year he started back with his college sport of tennis and is playing with the Capital Tennis Association.</p>
<p>?I am having an absolute blast,? Long says. ?The camaraderie is incredible for me. Even if you compete badly, everyone still wants you around.?</p>
<p>Robert Treadway has been the president of the Capital Area Rainbowlers Association for four-and-a-half years and has been the tournament director for the Halloween Invitational multiple times. He started bowling at age 6 while growing up in New Orleans.</p>
<p>After receiving his degree in journalism from Loyola University New Orleans, Treadway came to D.C. for internships with the Washington Times and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. He loved the area and ended up moving here in 2004 to work with trade associations.</p>
<p>His first boss was gay and he subsequently met other bowlers through him and joined the club in 2004. Treadway remembers what it meant to him joining as a rookie and is now offering that same support to the newbies who are joining.</p>
<p>?When I first joined, I was new to the city and besides giving me tips and teaching me the courtesies of the game, my teammates showed me that it is not just a competition, but also a place to make good friends,? he says.</p>
<p>The Rainbowlers offer skill enhancement clinics with bowlers who are certified by the United States Bowling Congress and special events such as mini-tournaments, scotch doubles and a crazy tournament.</p>
<p>?For the veterans, after you have done something for so long, it?s good to mix it up and experience the newness again,? Treadway says. ?For the rookies, it gives them tournament experience and the opportunity to experience a new format.?</p>
<p>Treadway has competed all over the United States from Fort Lauderdale to Syracuse. He will be traveling to tournaments in Philadelphia, Atlanta and Raleigh to promote the Halloween tournament in D.C.</p>
<p>He has also been a competitor with the Capital Tennis Association for four years and last month he placed second place with his doubles partner in the C Division at the Sin City Shootout in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>?Joining the Rainbowlers has been one of the best things I have ever done,? Treadway says. ?The social rewards are huge and it gave me the confidence to try tennis.?</p>

<article id="0000502" published-at="2014-08-04" title=""><p>The noble traditions of Judaism stressing justice for the downtrodden are being soiled by the endless cruelties that Israel and its current leaders heap on the Palestinians, including the latest slaughter&amp;#160;of more than 1,700 Gazans, many of them&amp;#160;children, a moral catastrophe addressed by theologian Daniel C. Maguire.</p>
<p>By Daniel C. Maguire</p>
<p>What is going on in Gaza is a prison riot not a war. A war means a conflict between comparably endowed adversaries. This is a prison riot caused by the crimes of the jailor, Israel. And why are these 1.7 million people enclosed in what Jewish scholar Marc Ellis calls ?the biggest jail in the world?? They are in jail because they are not Jews. That is their crime.</p>
<p>Were they Jews, they would be given beautiful homes, ample water supplies, government stipends. The fourth strongest army in the world and the sixth strongest nuclear power would be there to defend them. But, no, because the Gazans are not Jews, they are in an Israeli jail.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at AIPAC conference in Washington, D.C., on March 4, 2014.</p>
<p>These jailed people ? or at least&amp;#160;their parents and grandparents ? once had homes and gardens, olive groves and farms and lived peacefully on the land alongside all their neighbors. In the Nineteenth Century, Palestine was inhabited by a multicultural population, 86 percent Muslim, 10 percent Christian and four percent Jewish. They all lived peacefully together. The State of Israel changed all of that.</p>
<p>Jailors do not like riots. Riots call attention to conditions in the jail. The jailors, having little to fear from the homemade weapons of the prisoners, can suppress the riot violently with their superior weapons and inflict brutal punishment on all those in the jail, even those who did not or could not protest. The jailors will claim that what they are doing is self-defense geared to produce peace in the prison and restore law and order.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, Israel, the thousand pound gorilla, the Goliath of the Middle East, perpetrated an offensive act of war called a siege or blockade against the children, women and men of Gaza because Israel and its lapdog, the United States, did not like the results of Gaza?s election. In an unmatchable triumph of ersatz propaganda, Israel has been able to dupe many saying it is threatened by the impoverished prisoners in Gaza and the occupied people in the West Bank and part of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Rather than end the blockade of Gaza, Israel is now refusing even to discuss it in negotiations; this is unleashing the ?final solution? to the Gaza ?problem.? This should be called Operation Holocaust. It is the completion of the ethnic cleansing that drove over 700,000 Palestinians from their homes in 1948, deceptively called ?the war of independence? by the Israelis, al Nakba, the catastrophe, by the Palestinians.</p>
<p>The tunnels that were economic lifelines, as well as ways of getting some defensive weapons, are being destroyed by Israel and their ignoble allies the dictators in Egypt. The genocidal steps are being taken one by one; all the essentials of life are being removed, water, electricity, medicine, food, housing while the U.S. Senate, in an epic display of pusillanimity, votes unanimously to bless the slaughter.</p>
<p>AIPAC boasts that it can remove any member of the U.S. Congress who does not do its bidding. It has proved that in cases like Cynthia McKinney and Earl Hilliard. There is not a single Profile in Courage in the U.S. Senate, not even Bernie Sanders. They all cower before AIPAC as does the White House.</p>
<p>AIPAC-ocracy replaces democracy in U.S. policy re Israel. Our Congress is AIPAC-occupied territory. And with a few exceptions such as Jewish Voices For Peace, American Jews, who are the backbone of AIPAC, are underwriting events with their telling silence.</p>
<p>The piercing irony is this: what Israel is doing, and American Jews are largely supporting, is not Jewish. It is heretical to the prophetic moral vision of the Hebrews with their passion for ?orphans, widows, and immigrants,? with their conviction, as Isaiah put it, that only when you plant justice can you reap peace. (Isaiah 32:17) Israel?s rapacious policy toward the Palestinians is heretical to the rich moral tradition that the early Hebrews bequeathed to the world.</p>
<p>You can almost hear the Hebrew prophets crying out to Israel: ?Have you eyes and cannot see? Have you ears and cannot hear?? Modern Israel is deaf to Micah?s plea that you cannot build ?Zion in bloodshed.? (Micah 3:10) The great Abraham Heschel worried at the founding of Israel that the state of Israel could become alienated from Judaism. That, I aver, is precisely what has happened.</p>

<p>Speaking to the national conversation on ?fake news,?

<p>Following the ?Time?s Up? theme of the night, Oprah moved the crowd by encouraging those to fight against the industry?s powerful men. Promising for better days ahead, Winfrey praised victims of abuse and injustice for telling their stories, saying ?speaking your truth is the most powerful tool we all have.?&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Recognizing the magnitude of the #MeToo movement beyond Hollywood, Oprah said ?each of us in this room are celebrated because of the stories we tell. And this year, we became the story.?</p>
<p>Winfrey shared her historic moment with women who have ?endured years of abuse and assault, because they like my mother had bills to pay children to feed and dreams to pursue.?</p>
<p>Oprah encouraged all young girls watching that a new day was on the horizon.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>?And when that day finally dawns it will be because of a lot many magnificent women .. and some pretty phenomenal men fighting hard to make sure that they become the leaders who take us to the time when nobody ever has to say ?Me too? again.?</p>

<p>Golden Globes host Seth Meyers didn't shy away from addressing the sexual harassment scandals that rocked Hollywood last year, immediately opening the 75th annual awards show with a joke about the #MeToo movement.</p>
<p>Here are the Top 5 zingers from Meyer's monologue:&amp;#160;</p>
<p>"It?s 2018, marijuana&amp;#160;is finally allowed and sexual harassment&amp;#160;finally isn?t ? it's gonna be&amp;#160;a good year."&amp;#160;</p>
<p>"There?s a new era underway ?and I can tell because it?s been years since a white man was this nervous in Hollywood."&amp;#160;</p>
<p>"This was a year of big little lies and get out, and also the television series 'Big Little Lies' and 'Get Out.?"&amp;#160;</p>
<p>"For the male nominees in the room tonight, this is the first time in three months, it won?t be terrifying to hear your name read out-loud."</p>
<p>"Harvey Weinstein will be back in 20 years when he becomes the first person to be booed during the In Memoriam."</p>
<p>Allison Janney won for her supporting role in "I, Tonya," but to many she will forever be&amp;#160;White House press secretary C.J. Cregg on "The West Wing."&amp;#160;</p>
<p>And that includes Josh Earnest, former White House press secretary for President Barack Obama.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>"She was among the classiest people I met at the White House &amp;amp; tonight she gets a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoldenGlobe?src=hash" type="external">#GoldenGlobe</a>," Earnest tweeted in congratulating Janney.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Laura Dern, dressed in black in solidarity with the "Time's Up" movement, accepted the Globe for her supporting role in ?Big Little Lies.? Laura urged everyone to foster an environment of speaking out against abuse.</p>
<p>Dern nodded to her character in the series, Renata Klein, who was fighting for justice for her daughter who was being bullied in school. The actress urged the audience to encourage those who are victims to speak out.</p>
<p>"Many of us were taught not to tattle -- it was a culture of silencing and that was normalized ... May we teach our children that speaking out without the fear of retribution is our culture?s new North Star.?</p>
<p>The Golden Globes have not shied away from addressing the sexual harassment issues in Hollywood tonight -- and The Times is taking full advantage.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>The newspaper, which is credited with the investigation into Harvey Weinstein, strategically aired a television ad that advocates a strong message stating that "The Truth has a voice."</p>
<p>As a part of the overarching "Time's Up" movement, eight stars brought special guests to the 2018 Golden Globes. Laura Dern, Amy Poehler, Susan Sarandon, Meryl Streep, Emma Stone, Emma Watson, Michelle Williams and Shailene Woodley all walked the red carpet alongside social activists. The stars and their guests were dressed in black to stand in solidarity with victims of sexual abuse.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Learn more about who they are below:</p>
<p>Marai Larasi is the executive director of Imkaan, a United Kingdom based collective of organization that fights to end violence against black and minority women. Larasi was a guest of "Beauty and the Beast" star, Emma Watson.</p>
<p>#MeToo founder and 2017's TIME Person of the Year, Tarana Burke, walked the red carpet with Michelle Williams.</p>

<p>Actors may forget to thank their families or their agents while delivering heartfelt ?thank yous? for their Golden Globes, but there?s always one team they never forget to thank: The Hollywood Foreign Press Association. But who is the HFPA? &amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
<p>The Hollywood Foreign Press Association is an organization formed of 90 international journalists who write and report on the film and television industry. The nonprofit organization annually produces the Golden Globe Awards, and funds scholarships for film students. &amp;#160;</p>
<p>This year, HFPA President Meher Tatna announced two new grants, worth a $1 million each, to be awarded to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism and Committee to Protect Journalists.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>The first Golden Globes Awards were held in 1944 and the HFPA has recognized achievements in television and film for more than 70 years.</p>
<p>The mysterious Tommy Wiseau was sitting inside the Beverly Hilton during the first hour of the Globes(!)</p>
<p>He listened along as "The Disaster Artist" actor Seth Rogen described Wiseau's cult movie, "The Room," as "so bad it was enjoyable."</p>
<p>Earlier, on the red carpet, Wiseau described James Franco's performance as "99 percent approved," with one exception: "He doesn't know how to throw a football."</p>
<p>Nicole Kidman, Rachel Brosnahan and Elisabeth Moss ? actresses who portrayed strong women on shows that showed the importance of female voices ? all took home Globes in the first 30 minutes of the awards show Sunday night.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>"We no longer live in the blank white spaces at the edge of print. We no longer live in the gaps between the stories. We are the story in print ? and we are writing the stories ourselves," Moss said.</p>
<p>Nicole Kidman won for her acclaimed performance as the survivor of domestic abuse on "Big Little Lies." Rachel Brosnahan ("The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel") and Elisabeth Moss ("The Handmaid's Tale") were awarded statues for their roles in feminist-themed series.</p>
<p>"There are so many women stories that are still out there that still need and deserve to be told,"&amp;#160;Brosnahan said.</p>

<article id="0000508" title="Amelia Earhart prenup from the 1930?s lays out a pretty darn modern vision of marriage"><p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Wondering what a <a href="http://www.thegrindstone.com/2012/07/24/mentor/amelia-earhart-is-the-ultimate-feminist-icon-and-she-still-has-lots-to-teach-us/" type="external">feminist icon</a> living in the earlier half of the 1900?s thought about love and marriage? Look no further than the document above, a letter from Earhart to her future husband George Putnam.</p>
<p>You?ll remember Earhart became famous as the first female aviator to fly a solo transatlantic flight, redefining expectations of women along the way. Then, she tragically disappeared during a flight in 1937 (only to reappear in a <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/movies/23amelia.html?_r=0" type="external">?carefully scrubbed?</a> <a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/movies/23amelia.html?_r=0" type="external">and ?exasperatingly dull? movie</a> in which she was played by Hilary Swank, but that?s for another post).</p>
<p>Of course, we love her anyway for her courage and fierceness, and even moreso having stumbled upon this priceless prenup agreement. Reading through the document, one thing becomes very clear: this woman had a clear sense of what she wanted out of a marriage. And I find much of her marital vision compelling, even today.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Earhart first expresses some trepidation about getting married at all (?You must know again my reluctance to marry??) for fear of derailing her career, which ?means most? to her. Maybe it?s just me, but this kind of agonizing over work-life balance sounds like a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/why-women-still-cant-have-it-all/309020/" type="external">distinctly familiar dilemma</a> to the modern feminist. Earhart goes on to give the rough outline of an open marriage (?I shall not hold you to any midaeval [sic] code of faithfulness? and emphasizes rather than monogamy a goal of ?finding happiness together?, on which she finds the marriage to be contingent.</p>
<p>Surely there are a lot of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/24/feminist-wedding-jessica-valenti" type="external">modern day feminists</a> who can relate to Earhart?s sentiments about marriage. But while her vision is forward-thinking, the well-reasoned perspective laid out in these papers is strangely reassuring to me, in that it?s a good reminder that ours is hardly the first, second, or even third generation to struggle to define what it means to be an independent, feminist, and successful while also being a loving and supportive partner and perhaps spouse.</p>
<p>For those who are wondering if this little piece of history could be too good to be true, I share and respect your internet skepticism. But this one is real, folks. You can check out the full archive, including this prenup, at the Purdue University Collection of Amelia Earhart Papers <a href="http://www.lib.purdue.edu/spcol/aearhart/" type="external">here</a>.</p>

<p>McMurtry, a prolific innovator named on 47 patents at Rolls-Royce and more than 150 at Renishaw, would retain his role as executive chairman and remain responsible for innovation and product strategy, Renishaw said.</p>
<p>McMurtry co-founded Renishaw in 1973 to commercialise a 3D probe he developed to solve measurement issues faced by Rolls-Royce?s Olympus engines. Under his leadership, Renishaw has steadily grown its revenues.</p>
<p>Renishaw, which supplies products and services used in jet engines, wind turbines, dentistry and brain surgery, said Lee would step into the CEO role on Feb. 1.</p>
<p>Lee, who has a degree in physics and an MBA, joined Renishaw in 1996 in the new product research unit. He headed the laser and calibration product line and machine tool product line before moving to his current role in 2016.</p>
<p>McMurtry said Lee had demonstrated the ?leadership capabilities? needed to develop the Renishaw business.</p>
<p>Renishaw, which posts half-year results on Thursday, reported higher first-quarter revenue on the back of strong demand for its precision measuring devices in manufacturing hubs such as the Far East.</p>

<p>JERUSALEM, March 21 (Reuters) - Israel for the first time confirmed that it bombed a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor in 2007, saying on Wednesday that the strike removed a major threat to Israel and the region and was a ?message? to others.</p> A still frame taken from video material released on March 21, 2018 shows a combination image of what the Israeli military describes is before and after an Israeli air strike on a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor site near Deir al-Zor on Sept 6, 2007. IDF/Handout via Reuters TV
<p>The first public acknowledgement by Israel that its F-16 warplanes carried out the Sept. 6 2007 bombing of the partially constructed Al-Kubar facility near Deir al-Zor was made after military censors lifted a more than 10-year order that had barred Israeli officials from discussing it.</p>
<p>The strike had already been extensively reported on abroad, and discussed by U.S. officials.</p>
<p>The Israeli military released newly declassified operational footage, photographs and intelligence documents about the bombing, showing the moment that the suspected reactor was hit, an detailing the intelligence operation that led up to it.</p>
<p>Israeli intelligence reports concluded that the reactor had been under construction with North Korean help and was months away from activation. Reuters has been unable to immediately verify the Israeli material.</p>
<p>Israel?s decision to go public comes after repeated calls in recent months by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the United States and international community to take tougher action on Syria?s ally, Iran.</p> Related Coverage

<p>?The motivation of our enemies has grown in recent years, but so too the might of the IDF (Israel Defence Forces),? Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>?Everyone in the Middle East would do well to internalize this equation,? he said.</p>
<p>The 5 a.m. Wednesday release of the declassified documents prompted a cascade of Israeli newspaper and television reports.</p>
<p>The Israeli military described in detail the events leading up to the night of Sept 5 to Sept 6, 2007, in which, it said, eight F-16 warplanes took off from the Ramon and Hatzerim air bases and flew to Deir al-Zor region, 450 km northwest of Damascus, Syria.</p>
<p>The operation was launched after it received intelligence indicating that ?a substantial threat to Israel and the region, in the form of a nuclear reactor, was being built in Syria?.</p> ?TOP SECRET?
<p>The military declassified internal ?top secret? intelligence reports, in Hebrew, some of them partly redacted.</p> FILE PHOTO- This undated image released by the U.S. Government shows a building after it was bombed in Syria. U.S. Government/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo
<p>One, dated March 30, 2007, said: ?Syria has set up, within its territory, a nuclear reactor for the production of plutonium, through North Korea, which according to an (initial) worst-case assessment is liable to be activated in approximately another year. To our assessment [REDACTED] secretive and orderly [REDACTED] for achieving a nuclear weapon.?</p>
<p>Israeli intelligence predicted that the suspected reactor ?would turn operational by the end of 2007?.</p>
<p>The mission to destroy the facility started at 10.30 p.m. on Sept. 5 and ended with safe return of the warplanes at 2.30 a.m. the next day, the Israeli military said.</p>
<p>The military said the reactor ?had been totally disabled, and that the damage done was irreversible?. It decided at the time not to go public with the strike.</p>
<p>As it happened, the event was first made public by Syria, which, as reported by Reuters at the time, said in the early hours of Sept. 6 that Syrian air defenses had repelled an incursion by Israeli warplanes.</p> Slideshow (16 Images)
<p>Syria, a signatory of the 1970 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), has always denied that the site was a reactor or that Damascus engaged in nuclear cooperation with North Korea.</p>
<p>The Israeli military announcement on Wednesday noted that the area in question, around Deir al-Zor, was captured by Islamic State after the Syrian civil war erupted in 2011.</p>
<p>Had there been an active reactor there, the Israeli military said, it would have had ?severe strategic implications on the entire Middle East as well as Israel and Syria?.</p> COUNTDOWN
<p>The Israeli release contains a black-and-white aerial photograph captioned ?before the attack? and showing a box-like square structure amid desert dunes with smaller outlying buildings.</p>
<p>A series of black-and-white videos, taken above the target, shows the structure in cross-hairs. A male voice is heard counting down three seconds, a cloud of black smoke rises from the center of the structure as it explodes. Other footage appears to show the aftermath - a smoldering hole in the ground.</p>
<p>A clip taken from ?The Air Force Control Center, headed by the Commander of the IAF, Maj. Gen. Eliezer Shkedi? shows assembled Israeli air force personnel, some of their faces pixilated, applauding as they receive an update.</p>

<p>Wednesday?s release came ahead of the publication of a memoir by Olmert. One of his aides told Reuters the book would contain passages about the 2007 strike in Syria.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates at its first policy meeting under Chairman Jerome Powell and may signal more hikes are coming in response to tax cuts and government spending that could further stoke a robust U.S. economy.</p> FILE PHOTO: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivers the semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to the House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington, U.S., February 27, 2018.

<p>The U.S. central bank projected late last year that it would lift rates three times in 2018, but some investors believe the fiscal stimulus and recent hints of inflation pressures will push policymakers to add an additional increase to the mix.</p>
<p>(Interactive graphic of Fed's forecasts, dove-hawk divide: <a href="http://tmsnrt.rs/2gsUVwB" type="external">tmsnrt.rs/2gsUVwB</a>)</p>
<p>Sponsored</p>
<p>The Fed is scheduled to issue its latest policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). Powell is due to hold a press conference half an hour later.</p>
<p>Fed officials have speculated in recent weeks that the stimulus could drive more Americans into an already tight labor market and lift inflation to the central bank?s 2 percent target, or much above that level if the economy gets too hot.</p>
<p>Yet analysts are split over whether the Fed, which is wary of an early misstep under its new leadership, will raise policy tightening expectations until more price pressures are clearly evident, especially given outside risks to the economy such as a possible global trade war.</p>
<p>?A prudent institution would probably give more weight to the facts, at least for the moment,? Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist who is now a partner at Cornerstone Macro, wrote in a note predicting the Fed would stick with three projected rate increases for this year.</p>
<p>The Fed?s drive to stimulate the world?s largest economy in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession is drawing to a close. It raised its benchmark overnight lending rate three times last year, to a range of 1.25 to 1.50 percent, as joblessness fell and economic growth accelerated. It is expected to raise rates by another 25 basis points on Wednesday.</p>
<p>With futures markets anticipating another increase in June, Powell's Fed could leave its rate outlook unchanged until then to see how the economy absorbs the $1.8 trillion in stimulus expected from the Trump administration tax cuts and planned spending. (Graphic of Fed forecasts: <a href="http://tmsnrt.rs/2gsUVwB" type="external">tmsnrt.rs/2gsUVwB</a>)</p> POWELL IN SPOTLIGHT
<p>While recent home sales and retail spending data have been on the weak side, the overall economic picture has brightened this year. Inflation has strengthened after remaining below the Fed?s target for more than five years, and there have been more hints of wage gains.</p>
<p>The central bank is expected on Wednesday to boost its economic growth forecasts for the next few years, and could project that the unemployment rate will fall well below the current 4.1 percent, which is seen as a low but stable level.</p>
<p>The blockbuster U.S. jobs report for February could further convince Powell and his colleagues that the Fed?s stated ?gradual? rate hike path could carry on longer than previously thought. A sign of this would be a rise in the Fed?s longer-term, or neutral, expected policy rate, currently at 2.8 percent.</p>
<p>Powell, who took over from former Fed chief Janet Yellen in early February, triggered a brief global market selloff when he told U.S. lawmakers late last month that he had grown more confident in the economic outlook. Yet worries over a new hawkish central bank are likely overblown given Powell?s cautious, consensus-building approach.</p>
<p>Seven of the 15 Fed policymakers who will update their forecasts on Wednesday have recently indicated the fiscal stimulus could boost their expectations for the economy, rate hikes, or for both, according to an analysis of public statements.</p>
<p>New York Fed President William Dudley, one of the most influential policymakers, said four rate increases this year would still be considered ?gradual,? noting that fiscal policy is turning ?quite stimulative.?</p>
<p>The comments suggested a shift ?towards a potentially faster pace of tightening ... particularly with tax cuts now implemented and with an additional fiscal boost from federal spending arriving this year,? Jan Hatzius, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note predicting that the Fed would signal on Wednesday that rates will rise four times this year.</p>

<article id="0000513" published-at="2012-10-25" title="Bernie Rhinerson Prioritizes Achievement for Community Colleges"><p>Community colleges are an essential part of San Diego?s success as a city. Students either earn career and technical certification or transition into a university. Bernie Rhinerson believes it is the job of the community colleges and its board of trustees to secure the connections between the education provided and the students? next step.</p>
<p>Bernie Rhinerson is a candidate for the <a href="http://sdccd.edu/public/district/" type="external">San Diego Community College District</a> (SDCCD) Board of Trustees. He highlights his priority for community colleges in <a href="http://www.smartvoter.org/2012/06/05/ca/sd/vote/rhinerson_b/paper1.html" type="external">his ballot statement</a>:</p>
<p>Completion of an A.A. or A.S. degree must lead to placement in a four year college or university. Our career technical programs must also be linked to real world job opportunities.&amp;#160;This extremely difficult economy is not the time to cut back on access to critically needed education and job training.</p>
<p>Rhinerson sees two of the biggest challenges facing SDCCD as completion rates and funding. He explains how he would take on those challenges:</p>
<p>To increase completion rates, I support the recommendations of the <a href="http://www.californiacommunitycolleges.cccco.edu/PolicyInAction/StudentSuccessTaskForce.aspx" type="external">Student Success Task Force</a>, which <a href="http://www.sdccd.edu/public/administration/carroll.shtml" type="external">Chancellor Dr. Constance Carrol</a> participated in. These recommendations would make substantive changes to student assessments, registration policies and other policies that will help students make progress on their educational plans and help move them toward a degree and skills certifications.</p>
<p>Bernie Rhinerson is&amp;#160;referring&amp;#160;to the <a href="" type="internal">Student Success Act</a>, which was signed by Governor Jerry Brown in&amp;#160;September. The bill is for increasing effective matriculation to make sure students understand the requirements for completion.</p>
<p>On the issue of funding, Rhinerson says he ?will be a strong advocate for public education funding.? He is a proponent of Governor Jerry Brown?s initiative Proposition 30. Mr. Rhinerson stresses the return of investment when governments invest in education:</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.collegecampaign.org/index.php/download_file/view/737/91/" type="external">recent study by the Campaign for College Opportunity</a> shows that for every dollar that California invests in students who graduate, the state will receive a net benefit on that investment of four dollars and fifty cents. Education is a great investment for our state.</p>
<p>The race for the community college board is not a highly publicized contest. Candidates who seek to represent educational institutions do not have the same resources as politicians. Bernie Rhinerson says his biggest challenge is getting name identification with voters and, of course, raising money. He further added: ?It is also a challenge to campaign when you have a full time job. This is truly a public service position and not a political career for me.?</p>
<p>Since the community college board election is a low-profile race, Bernie Rhinerson recommends that voters should:</p>
<p>Get informed about the candidates and choose a candidate who has the best experience and commitment for the position. The community college board needs a leader who understands public education and who will be a strong advocate for students and for the benefits that public education brings to our local economy.</p>
<p>Bernie Rhinerson is a two time graduate of San Diego State University. He earned a Bachelor?s degree in Psychology and a Master?s in Public Administration. He is currently the chief of staff for the San Diego Unified School District and teaches public administration at SDSU. He was also a past president of the SDSU Alumni Association.</p>
<p>Bernie Rhinerson also has 30 years experience in private business. He <a href="http://www.bernie4collegeboard.org/sample-page/" type="external">has worked at</a> Stoorza, Ziegaus &amp;amp; Metzger, Four Square Productions, and Southwest Strategies in high executive positions.</p>
<p>One seat is open for the San Diego Community College Board of Trustees, as current District B representative Bill Schwandt is retiring. District B&amp;#160;covers northern San Diego including Mira Mesa and Scripps Ranch. Bernie Rhinerson is running for the open seat against renewable energy businessman Scott Hasson.</p>
<p>The San Diego Community College District includes three campuses: Mesa, City, and Miramar College. SDCCD also includes six&amp;#160;Continuing&amp;#160;Education campuses, where SDUSD board candidate <a href="" type="internal">Marne Foster</a> has worked extensively.</p>
<p>In the 2009-2010 academic year, SDCCD enrolled a total of 131,403 students.&amp;#160;74,126 were attending one of the three undergraduate campuses and&amp;#160;60,273 were attending Continuing Education campuses.</p></article>
<article id="0000514" published-at="2016-09-14" title="ObamaCare Becomes the Cruelest Tax on Working Americans"><p>When it comes to how we are insured for our health, there are basically three markets: government (Medicaid, Medicare), the employer market, and the individual market. Most Americans are insured either through the government or through their employer. The individual market is where everyone else purchases health insurance, and does so on their own. And this is the market most affected (and decimated) by ObamaCare.</p>
<p>On and off, throughout the last 15 years, it has been through the individual market that I have purchased my own health coverage. This means that I am quite familiar with the damage ObamaCare has done to those stuck in this market, most of whom are not poor enough for Medicaid -- which means they come from the working and middle class. Boiled down, ObamaCare has become a cruel tax on working people, who are now forced by their government to pay an enormous sum of money for what is now a nearly useless product.</p>
<p>Prior to ObamaCare the individual market was far from perfect. You could be denied coverage for any number of reasons, including a pre-existing condition. I was once denied coverage for refusing to take a prescription drug with flu-like side effects.</p>
<p>Even before ObamaCare, one of the individual market's biggest setbacks was a lack of competition. Because our government is corrupt, insurers were and are still not allowed to sell their product across state lines (Trump wants to remedy this, God bless him). This dramatically shrinks the market to within the individual state, which in turn means less competition for insurers, which in turn means higher prices and an increased amount of dickish corporate behavior.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite its wild imperfections, I was always able to purchase coverage at a reasonable price. Other than a bad lower back, for a 50 year-old guy I'm in good health. For this reason, I would always purchase what was called a "catastrophic plan" -- a policy with a $6000 to $10,000 deductible for anywhere from $150 to $225 a month.</p>
<p>Catastrophic plans were not just good for me personally, they were good for the entire health care system. What you had were millions of people insured in case of a dire health emergency, like a car crash or cancer, but otherwise doing something no one else does: treating the healthcare industry like a free market.</p>
<p>Somewhere around 90% of insured Americans do NOT treat the health care industry like a free market. Because someone else is paying for their health services (an insurance company), no one prices anything. Therefore, unlike every other product and service in America, health care providers are not under any pressure from customers when it comes to cost.</p>
<p>The perfect example of this is to look at the respective cost curves of medical procedures that are and are not covered by insurance. It is no secret that overall health care costs have exploded, and <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/06/21/health-care-rising-costs/" type="external">done so well ahead of inflation</a> (this is another broken ObamaCare promise). And yet, like plasma televisions and Bluray players, the cost of medical procedures not covered by insurance, like Lasik and plastic surgeries, have decreased. I can also tell you from personal experience that eye exams and glasses are much cheaper than they used to be. My annual flu shot, which is now available at the local CVS or Walgreens, is a mere $25, or about 1/10th of what a doctor visit for a flu shot would cost your insurance company.</p>
<p>Once you are outside of the insurance market, you also discover that even insured services are cheaper. Since I now pay everything out of pocket, everything is cheaper. My doctors charge much less for visits and my prescriptions are actually cheaper than what my co-pay cost when I was insured. I once called around pricing an MRI, something an insured person would never do, and the prices ranged from $2500 to $400. Guess who got my business.</p>
<p>At the risk of putting too fine a point on this, imagine the cost of a brake job or oil change if we insured our car repairs like we do our health. The whole idea of health insurance, outside of a catastrophic illness, is not only stupid, it's exploding costs.</p>
<p>And what did ObamaCare do? It outlawed these wonderful catastrophic plans. I'm not sure how such an act is Constitutional in a free country, but that's for another column. What I do know is that rather than enjoying access to tailor-made insurance plans, every American is now required to purchase a comprehensive plan. Under ObamaCare, although I am a 50 year-old male, I must pay <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2014/03/13/obamacare-charges-millions-of-unsuspecting-americans-for-coverage-theyll-never-use/#7bbb1a95173c" type="external">for pre-natal care, maternity care, etc.</a></p>
<p>The best comparison to drive home how absurdly ridiculous this is, is to have you imagine the government passing a law that requires everyone to purchase, not just a car, but a Cadillac.</p>
<p>Now that the backfill is complete, let me explain my headline. Here is how ObamaCare is nothing more than a cruel tax on the working and middle class.</p>
<p>Tax #1 - Health care costs have increased dramatically for everyone</p>
<p>Thanks to the failure of ObamaCare, the cost of everyone's healthcare is exploding. Everyone. Not just those in the individual market. If you recall, President LiarMcFailure and his fact-checking media promised us health care costs would decrease by $2500 a year under ObamaCare. The reality is that, in many cases, costs have actually increased by that much. That's a tax.</p>
<p>ObamaCare defenders will argue that costs were increasing prior to ObamaCare, which is true. But not by this much.</p>
<p>Tax #2 - ObamaCare premium explosion</p>
<p>Even before the newest rate increases of around 20% go into <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article80879447.html" type="external">effect next year</a>, the cost of my monthly premiums more than doubled to $450 a month. What's especially maddening is that the deductible is still an obnoxiously high $4000 - $5000.</p>
<p>What this means, essentially, is that I'm paying for a Cadillac health insurance plan that I'll never use.</p>
<p>That's a tax -- a huge tax, a massive tax.</p>
<p>Granted, I never used the catastrophic plan, but that premium was much lower and I was not mandated by our corrupt government to purchase it.</p>
<p>ObamaCare defenders will argue that, thanks to government subsidies, many ObamaCare recipients won't pay a price increase. So what? Taxpayers still have to pay for the subsidy.</p>
<p>Tax #3 - You're paying more for an increasingly awful service</p>
<p>Even with that obnoxious restriction that wouldn?t allow insurance companies to sell across state lines, each state still had a number of companies to choose from. But now that ObamaCare is decimating the individual marketplace, insurance companies are fleeing the individual market, which means that companies you once could purchase insurance from prior to ObamCare, you no longer can. The government has chased them completely out of business.</p>
<p>In most every state, the number of providers is shrinking, your choices as a consumer are decreasing by the year. In the entire state of New Jersey, you have only two insurance companies to choose from.</p>
<p>Tax #4 - The ObamaCare penalty</p>
<p>You're a freeborn American. You look at the choices offered by ObamaCare. You decide that paying $5000 a year for a lousy policy you will never use is madness. You choose not to purchase health insurance and instead choose to pay out of your own pocket for whatever medical needs you and your family might need.</p>
<p>Too bad.</p>
<p>That choice is now outlawed.</p>
<p>If you make that choice, you will be taxed 2.5% of your annual income.</p>
<p>Tax #5 - The deficit</p>
<p>The ObamaCare boondoggle is costing taxpayers tens <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2014/10/17/now-there-can-be-no-doubt-obamacare-will-increase-the-deficit/#6bfb062953d1" type="external">of millions of dollars</a> a year in deficit spending. Because the Boomers and their spawn are too selfish to live within their means, their bill will be paid for by our children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>That's a tax.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Fewer choices. A worse product. Double the cost.</p>
<p>Those of us opposed to ObamaCare warned of this in advance, and for our trouble the mainstream media labeled us racist.</p>

Ozone and possibly other pollutants are apparently blowing over the ocean, causing all sorts of problems and reminding us that exporting our pollution to the developing world isn?t exactly working out. ? PZS</p>
<p>Los Angeles Times:</p>
<p>Ozone from Asia is wafting across the Pacific on springtime winds and boosting the amount of the smog-producing chemical found in the skies above the Western United States, researchers said in a study released Wednesday.</p>
<p>The study, published in the journal Nature, probes a phenomenon that has puzzled scientists in the last decade: Ground-level ozone has dropped in cities thanks to tighter pollution controls, but it has risen in rural areas in the Western U.S., where there is little industry or automobile traffic.</p>

<article id="0000517" published-at="2016-03-05" title="Ahead of Mayweather fight, film depicts Pacquiao's crushing poverty before global fame"><p>As a dirt-poor rookie boxer in the southern Philippines, Manny Pacquiao started his phenomenal rise to global fame not as the Pacman, as he is sometimes called, but as "Kid Kulafu."</p>
<p>That moniker ? the title of a new local film about Pacquiao's childhood ? was taken from the label of a cheap wine whose empty bottles he returned for recycling to earn money to help his family.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>"Kid Kulafu" opened Wednesday in more than 70 theaters across the Philippines starting ahead of Pacquiao's May 2 megafight with Floyd Mayweather. It will be shown in some U.S. and Canadian theaters beginning April 24.</p>
<p>Produced with advice and other assistance from Pacquiao, the film depicts the impoverished world he grew up in well before he became the world's only eight-division boxing champion, one of its highest-paid athletes and the wealthiest member of the Philippine House of Representatives.</p>
<p>"He had every excuse in the book to fail ? broken family, no food, no home, nowhere to go, no money, but he still persevered, and that's what I want the people to see ? that he is where he is today because of hard work," filmmaker Paul Soriano told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The 36-year-old boxer was born in a thatch-roofed house with a dirt floor in the mountains of southern Bukidnon province at a time when anti-communist militiamen were battling insurgents. One brutal clash near the Pacquiao home forced the family to move to General Santos city, into a shack owned by his uncle, Sardo Mejia.</p>
<p>There often was not enough food for the family; sometimes they ate boiled rice paired with fish entrails or corn on the cob. In the movie, militiamen compel Pacquiao's mother to hand over two small fried fish she had prepared for her family.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Pacquiao's father later abandoned the family, leaving Manny, the eldest of three brothers, to find a livelihood like most young boys in the country's rural areas. He sold fried peanuts, bread and doughnuts made by his mother, and earned a little money of his own by gathering and selling tiny native lemons called calamansi.</p>
<p>He also worked as a store assistant for Mejia, and collected sacks of empty bottles of Vino Kulafu, which he returned to the distributors to cash in the deposits. Kulafu was originally a Tarzan-like Filipino comic-book hero.</p>
<p>Pacquiao became drawn to boxing after he started watching Betamax tapes of world heavyweight fights with his uncle. Mejia encouraged Pacquiao to box and later trained him, though his mother hated the sport. She wanted her son to be a priest, but was too poor to enter him into a seminary. Still, she ingrained deep spirituality and religious faith in him.</p>
<p>Ironically, Pacquiao's road to boxing was partially paved by his mother when she was struck by a heart attack, Soriano said. The movie depicts the boy entering a fight to win 100 pesos (about $2) needed to buy her medicine.</p>
<p>With training by his uncle and a friend's father, Pacquiao soon became the amateur boxing derby champion in General Santos, fighting in the open-air ring in the town plaza as Kid Kulafu, a name Mejia came up with. Without telling his mother, he left General Santos to train in a dingy boxing gym in Manila.</p>
<p>"'Kid Kulafu' is really a movie about a young boy who grew up with nothing," Soriano said. "All he really had was a dream and he fought and fought and fought until he made those dreams come true."</p>
<p>The movie, with most scenes shot on location, was produced by Ten17P, an independent film company owned by Soriano, a director and producer who also has directed many of Pacquiao's local television ads.</p>
<p>The 110-minute film was three years in the making, including two years of research and emotional interviews with Pacquiao, members of his family, friends and former trainers, Soriano said.</p>
<p>"It is a fairy-tale story, but it's true," producer Marie Pineda said.</p>
<p>The "rags" part of Pacquiao's rags-to-riches story is all too familiar in the Philippines. Many Filipinos are born into poverty and forced to leave home to find work in Manila or even other countries to support their families. About 10 million Filipinos, a tenth of the population, work abroad and send money back home that helps shore up the economy.</p>
<p>The 17-year-old actor playing Pacquiao, Buboy Villar, also grew up poor with separated parents; he had to scavenge garbage heaps to earn money before becoming a child star in Philippine TV and movies.</p>
<p>While Villar shares Pacquiao's humble beginnings, the boxing skills took more work: He spent weeks building up muscles and learning to move as a southpaw like the champion.</p>
<p>Soriano said the film takes some creative license to compress Pacquiao's first 15 years, but is true to the boxer's life. Pacquiao did not produce or invest in the film but helped in making it, facilitating interviews with key characters and going over the script while but giving Soriano creative freedom, the filmmaker said.</p>
<p>"I think, honestly, what he gave me ? his time, his story ? I think that was even much more important than any money," Soriano said. "The access he gave me, the friendship that he has given me ? that's priceless."</p>

<p>A Broadway musical based on Cher?s life is one step closer to production.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/04/19/a-cher-musical-could-land-on-broadway-soon/" type="external">New York Post,</a> ?Jersey Boys? writer Rick Elice presented a script of a musical about the pop star?s life, currently titled ?Cher: The Musical,? to ?Hamilton? producer Jeffrey Seller on Wednesday. &amp;#160;Seller has also produced ?Avenue Q,? ?In the Heights? and ?Rent.?</p>
<p>?They may pack me in a van and have me carted away when they see what I?ve done with her life,? Elice told the New York Post about presenting his script. ?Or I?ll start doing what Arthur Laurents always said about musicals, ?They don?t get written. They get rewritten.???</p>
<p>The musical will include Cher?s hit songs such as ?Believe,? ?If I Could Turn Back Time,? ?Take Me Home,? ?I Got You Babe? and ?Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves.?</p>
<p>In 2012, Cher tweeted producers were developing a musical about her life. The star revealed three actresses would play her in different stages of her career. One actress would play her during the ?Sonny and Cher? years, another actress would portray her during her ?Believe? tour and the last would be the singer in the current part of her life.</p>

<article id="0000524" title="Churches can become welcoming places to parents of children with learning differences"><p>Parents of squirming children who cannot stay focused and who often end up labeled as ?troublemakers? some-times feel isolated ? and maybe even unwelcome in church.</p>
<p>Author Maren Angellotti believes they are in good company. The parents of John the Baptist and the Apostle Peter might have felt the same way.</p>
<p>?It?s obvious from God?s word that he has no problem working with people who are different. ? In fact, he seems to prefer it,? Angelloti writes in her book, Of Different Minds: Seeing Your AD/HD Child Through the Eyes of God.</p>
<p>Angelotti ? who earned a master?s degree in teaching for the learning-different student from Dallas Baptist University ? understands learning disabilities such as attention deficit disorder, hyperactivity, dyslexia and perceptual dysfunctions.</p>
<p>As a reading therapist who specializes in remediation programs for dyslexic students, she recognizes the neurological differences between the brain activity of the general population and children with learning disabilities.</p>
<p>But she also understands learning differences experientially. Three of her four children have learning disabilities ? two diagnosed with ADD, dyslexia and related disorders, and one with ADD and auditory processing disorder. And she realizes the children inherited those traits ? she is dyslexic, and her husband, Bob, has ADD.</p>
<p>One big challenge parents of children with learning differences face is foundering in what Angelotti calls ?the sea of denial? and failing to come to terms with the special needs their children have.</p>
<p>?Pride is really the bottom line. They have a tendency to say, ?Nobody needs to help me,?? she said in an interview.</p>
<p>But if churches seriously want to minister to all families ? including parents of the more than 2 million children in the United States with learning differences ? they must approach parents in ways that break down those walls of prideful self-sufficiency, Angelotti insisted. And the churches themselves must move out of denial that a need exists, she added.</p>
<p>?The faith community has to realize there is a problem. It?s not so much that the church has dropped the ball, but it hasn?t really picked up the ball, either,? she said.</p>
<p>Matthew Stanford, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, has noted AD/HD, in particular, is a controversial topic among some evangelicals.</p>
<p>?Within Christian circles, some have gone as far as to suggest that AD/HD is nothing more than rebellion, resulting from bad parenting, or society?s attempt to turn sin into sickness,? Stanford writes in Grace for the Afflicted: A Clinicial and Biblical Perspective on Mental Illness.</p>
<p>While he acknowledges AD/HD has been misdiagnosed, and probably overdiagnosed, that does not negate its reality or churches? responsibility to respond. AD/HD is ?a real disorder that affects the lives of real children and their families,? he writes.</p>
<p>?These children wrestle daily with debilitating physical, psychological and spiritual issues. Although mistakes may have been made in relation to diagnoses in the past, this does not change the fact that children who do struggle with this disorder can be effectively treated. And the church has a significant role to play in their healing.?</p>
<p>An important first step churches can take is to educate members ? particularly Sunday school teachers and children?s workers ? about learning differences and learning styles.</p>
<p>?One of the greatest services churches can provide is to give families a place where they feel safe,? Angelotti said. ?Churches are at their best when they help children to become what God intended them to be.?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Churches become more welcoming places for families of children with learning disabilities when adults who work with the children understand them, several children?s ministers noted.</p>
<p>First Baptist Church in Port Neches, Texas, seeks to be the kind of place where parents feel their children are affirmed and loved ? not rejected, said Jeanette Harvey, minister to children and preteens.</p>
<p>?We try to build trust with these parents who probably already have their defenses up. Some of them have been told by teachers and other authorities, ?Your child is a problem,?? she said.</p>
<p>?We want to love on them and let them know we want them here.?</p>
<p>A key way teachers and workers can help children with learning differences is by making accommodations to their special needs in ways that don?t single them out.</p>
<p>?They get enough of that at school and everywhere else they go,? noted Amy Owens, children?s minister at First Baptist Church in Garland, Texas.</p>
<p>In the Sunday school classroom, the accommodation may be as simple as encouraging teachers to vary their teaching styles to appeal to a variety of learning styles. By incorporating different styles that reach visual, auditory, tactile and kinesthetic learners ? children who learn best by seeing, hearing, touching or moving ? the needs of children who process information differently are met, she noted.</p>
<p>?When a teacher uses more than one approach frequently, that helps every child in the class, because the more senses they use, the more they absorb and learn,? Owens said.</p>
<p>Bible Drill competition ? a contest based on children?s ability to find quickly selected Scripture passages, as well as memorizing key verses and the books of the Bible ? presented a special challenge, but First Baptist Church in Garland, Texas, worked to level the playing field for children with dyslexia.</p>
<p>?We advocated at the associational and state levels for an easy accommodation for them,? said Owens, who has a daughter with dyslexia.</p>
<p>They changed the procedure of the competition slightly. When a monitor would call out verbally a Scripture passage or book in the Bible, he or she would hold up a visual cue at the same time. The accommodation not only helped the dyslexic children, but also was beneficial to competitors who were more visual learners rather than auditory.</p>
<p>Children with learning differences may require special attention, such as having a worker assigned specifically to that child to make sure he or she gets what is needed in order to learn, she noted.</p>
<p>While it generally can be done discretely, sometimes other children will notice the extra attention one child receives. When dealing with older children ? particularly preteens who may already have made a commitment to follow Christ ? teachers may want to gently explain the special needs of one of their classmates.</p>
<p>?Children are all about being fair. If we explain to the older kids that someone is getting extra attention because they need a little special help in order to be even with everybody else, in their minds, that?s fair treatment,? she said.</p>
<p>?Our kids are more compassionate than we give them credit for. Particularly if they already have become Christians, they have the Holy Spirit working in them. They are looking for opportunities to express that relationship they have with Christ.?</p>
<p>Churches also can minister to families of children with learning differences by offering programs that directly benefit the parents. Since most learning disabilities are inherited, oftentimes at least one parent has learning difficulty ? including many that went undiagnosed as children, Angelotti noted.</p>
<p>?Adults typically don?t seek help for themselves, but churches can provide assistance by offering literacy and reading training,? she noted.</p>
<p>Churches also can provide marriage enrichment ministries or even subsidized counseling that help couples directly address issues that put strains on their marriage. Among families affected by learning disabilities, most often one spouse has AD/HD, dyslexia or some other dysfunction, and the other learns to compensate, Angelotti observed.</p>
<p>?That can lead to a martyr syndrome, where one spouse feels he or she has to take care of everything,? she said. ?Finances particularly can be a point of tension that destroys a marriage. There is a high divorce rate among this group.</p>
<p>?When marriages are healthy, children are healthy ? mentally, spiritually and physically.?</p>

<p>The International Energy Agency said in its monthly market report that U.S. oil production, which has already risen to its highest level in nearly 50 years, will push past 10 million barrels a day in 2018 as higher prices entice more producers to start pumping.</p>
<p>"This year promises to be a record-setting one for the U.S.," it said.</p>
<p>The price of crude has risen about 50 percent since June, with the U.S. benchmark now trading around $63 a barrel, on evidence of strong global economic growth and a pact among OPEC countries and Russia to limit their production.</p>
<p>The OPEC-Russia deal worked for them: as prices rose they made more money despite pumping less crude, the IEA said. Russia is estimated to have earned an extra $117 million a day and Saudi Arabia $100 million daily by limiting their output and nudging up prices.</p>
<p>But the higher prices also brought back U.S. producers, particularly in shale oil, which requires higher prices in order to break even.</p>
<p>U.S. production rose last year to its highest since 1970 and is expected to keep growing, assuming OPEC and Russia don't decide to increase their own production ? a decision of which there is no sign, the IEA says.</p>
<p>Even the hurricanes of last year didn't hinder the U.S. oil production boom.</p>
<p>For now, the extra crude from the U.S. is meeting growing demand as the world economy expands at a strong pace.</p>
<p>Global demand for oil is forecast to grow by 1.3 million barrels a day, the same as the year before. It's not growing faster because some consumers are reducing spending on oil because of the higher prices and switching to other types of energy, like natural gas.</p>

<article id="0000529" published-at="2017-06-23" title="China tightens online video controls, jolting investors"><p>Three popular Chinese internet services have been ordered to stop streaming video after censors complained it contained improper comments on sensitive issues. The move prompted a sell-off in the U.S.-traded shares of Sina Corp. and its microblog service, Sina Weibo.</p>
<p>Thursday's announcement adds to efforts by President Xi Jinping's government to tighten media control ahead of a Communist Party congress late this year. Xi is due to be appointed to a second five-year term as party leader.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>Video streamed by users of Sina Weibo, AcFun and Phoenix New Media's ifeng.com contained "negative comments" about unspecified sensitive issues, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio Film and Television said. It ordered them to stop the services.</p>
<p>Communist leaders promote internet use for business and education but try to block access to material deemed subversive or obscene.</p>
<p>Beijing has been especially wary of social media since they were used by organizers of the Arab Spring protests that spread across the Middle East in 2010 and led to the downfall of the Egyptian and Tunisian governments.</p>
<p>Rules that took effect June 1 bar private or foreign companies from directly disseminating news or investing in online news services. Those that want to work with foreign partners must undergo a security review.</p>
<p>In January, the government announced the launch of a 14-month crackdown on cloud-hosting and content-delivery services. The technology ministry said it forbids use of virtual private networks and leased lines to circumvent government filters and access banned websites abroad.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Following Thursday's order, Weibo Corp. shares fell 6.1 percent on the Nasdaq market and shares of Sina fell 4.8 percent.</p>
<p>"The company is communicating with the relevant government authorities to understand the scope of the notice. It intends to fully cooperate with the relevant authorities," said a Weibo Corp. statement.</p>
<p>Sina Weibo's main business is a microblog service similar to U.S.-based Twitter Inc. It is one of the world's most popular social media services, with 313 million users as of December, according to the company.</p>
<p>Weibo Corp.'s stock market value surged past that of Twitter early this year. It stood at $15.8 billion after Thursday's selloff ? or more than double the $6.2 billion market value of its parent company ? compared with $13.2 billion for Twitter.</p>
<p>ifeng.com broadcasts brief news and entertainment videos. AcFun is a video-sharing site that is popular with young Chinese.</p>

<p>The promotions were announced on Sunday by CEO David Linde. Both Weyermann and King report to Linde.</p>
<p>?By shepherding inspiring and highly compelling films over the last decade, Diane and Jonathan have played integral roles in shaping Participant into the dynamic company it is today,? Linde said. ?Their promotions are not only well deserved, but also reflect their substantial commitment to our success and Jeff Skoll?s prescient mission of creating socially impactful content that inspires audiences to action.?</p>
<p>Skoll founded Participant in 2004 as a means of inspiring social change. Its most notable titles have included ?Syriana,? ?An Inconvenient Truth,? ?The Help,? ?Lincoln,? ?Spotlight,? and ?Citizenfour.?</p>
<p>King and Weyermann said, ?We are grateful to all the talented artists who share our belief that films can be both popular and impactful. Participant could not have grown over the years without their trust in us and we are proud to be able to return the favor, especially as we expand into television. Most of all, we appreciate the unwavering leadership and support from Jeff and David for the work we and our colleagues do every day.?</p>
<p>Participant?s upcoming film slate includes the documentary ?Human Flow? from Ai Weiwei, and narrative films including Stephen Chbosky?s ?Wonder,? starring Jacob Tremblay, Owen Wilson, and Julia Roberts; Andy Serkis? ?Breathe,? which premieres at the Toronto Film Festival; Steven Spielberg?s ?The Post?; the thriller ?Entebbe? from Jose Padilha; and Rupert Wyatt?s ?Captive State.?</p>
<p>The company?s expansion into television production includes Participant?s first limited scripted drama series, ?Central Park Five,? directed by Ava DuVernay, which will be released on Netflix. Weyermann is working with documentarian Steve James on the company?s first unscripted series, ?America to Me,? a yearlong look into public schools in Chicago?s suburban Oak Park.</p>
<p>King most recently held the title of executive VP of narrative film, overseeing ?Spotlight,? ?Beasts of No Nation,? ?The&amp;#160;Help,? ?Contagion,? ?The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,? ?Deepwater Horizon,? and ?Shot Caller.?&amp;#160;Prior to joining Participant in 2007, he worked as both a producer and an executive for companies including Focus Features, Laurence Mark Productions, and Miramax Films.</p>
<p>Weyermann was promoted from her recent position as exec VP of documentary film. She oversaw Participant?s upcoming release ?Human Flow,? which she executive produced, and the recent ?An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power,? for which she also served as a producer. She oversaw ?Citizenfour,? ?An Inconvenient Truth,? ?Food, Inc.,? ?Page One: Inside the New York Times,? and ?Darfur Now.? Prior to joining Participant in 2005, Weyermann served as the director of the Sundance Institute?s Documentary Film Program.</p></article>
<article id="0000531" published-at="2017-10-06" title="Trump Once Complained To Tillerson About Laws Restricting U.S. From Taking Bribes"><p>Throughout the course of his campaign, Donald Trump campaigned as a populist, but it is clear that he is governing as a plutocrat. Not only does Trump believe that corporations are too heavily taxed, but he also believes that they are too heavily regulated. Not only does Trump oppose things such as environmental protections, he also apparently believes that corporations should be allowed to take bribes from foreign officials.</p>
<p>In a piece entitled Rex Tillerson&amp;#160;at the Breaking Point,&amp;#160;The New Yorker <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/16/rex-tillerson-at-the-breaking-point" type="external">recounted</a>an incident early on in Trump?s presidency where the president complained about laws forbidding U.S. companies from taking bribes. Trump argued that the law made U.S. businesses less competitive. Trump?s Secretary of State, and former ExxonMobil CEO, had a different point of view, arguing that accepting&amp;#160;bribes would only weaken the standing of these companies.</p>
<p>?Tillerson disagreed. When he was an executive with Exxon, he told Trump, he once met with senior officials in Yemen to discuss a deal. At the meeting, Yemen?s oil minister handed him his business card. On the back was written an account number at a Swiss bank. ?Five million dollars,? the minister told him.</p>
<p>??I don?t do that,? Tillerson said. ?Exxon doesn?t do that.? If the Yemenis wanted Exxon on the deal, he said, they?d have to play straight. A month later, the Yemenis assented. ?Tillerson told Trump that America didn?t need to pay bribes?that we could bring the world up to our own standards,? a source with knowledge of the exchange told me.?</p>
<p>Prior to becoming president, Trump managed a large international business, so it is likely he has dealt with these laws before. It is more than a bit troubling that one of Trump?s biggest concerns while in the Oval Office is making it easier for corporations to take bribes.</p>
<p>The rest of the article details Tillerson?s history and discusses the recent tensions between himself and Trump. One of the most notable examples is the fact that Tillerson allegedly referred to Trump as a ?moron.? Trump has, of course, denied this ever happened along with the rumors that Tillerson planned on resigning.</p>

<p>?This is actually the first time that I?ve gone out in short sleeves and shorts in a while,? Neumann, 34, says, looking down at her shorts as she walks her dog on a muggy day at the open-air Lincoln Road Mall. ?But I?m always wearing bug spray no matter where I?m going, pretty much.?</p>
<p>Florida?s health department reported two more local Zika cases in Miami Beach Wednesday. So far, 158 people have been infected with Zika in Florida, and another 721 travelers from other Zika-affected places have shown up with the infection.</p>
<p>Doctors are keeping tabs on 141 pregnant women in Florida infected with Zika. If their babies become infected in the womb, they risk a range of birth defects from brain damage to vision problems and joint deformities.</p>
<p>Related: <a href="" type="internal">Full NBC News Coverage of Zika</a></p>
<p>Zika has spread explosively across parts of Latin America and the Caribbean and Miami was a natural place for it to take at least temporary hold, with so many travelers coming and going. Much of Florida is home year-round to the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that spread Zika. The virus can also spread sexually.</p>
<p>Neumann knew that Zika-infected mosquitoes had been trapped nearby. Even before that, she and her husband had been taking precautions</p>
<p>?We made efforts to go to more indoor places. We loaded up on bug spray,? she said.</p>
<p>?It sucks. But it?s better than contracting Zika,? she added. ?My husband and I, we?re wanting to start a family soon so it?s what we have to do.?</p>
<p>Others strolling in the popular shopping area were less concerned.</p>
<p>?I?ve only heard a little about it? but honestly I wasn?t that concerned about it coming here,? said Jairah Miguel of Vancouver. Her cousin, Delianne Narvaez of Las Vegas, said she researched Zika virus before booking the vacation and decided it wouldn?t be an issue.</p>
<p>?I don?t think I?m going to plan on having kids any time soon,? said Narvaez, who is 24.</p>

<p>Ernest Williams said he worried about Zika virus when he first arrived from California three months ago.</p>
<p>But the 28-year-old has gotten into the habit of wearing repellent. ?I still leave my skin exposed. I just wear a lot of Off,? Williams said.</p>
<p>It?s worked ? he says he is getting bitten less often.</p>
<p>?I don?t think a scare is going to scare people away from South Beach,? he said.</p>
<p>Some Miami beach residents <a href="" type="internal">protested against the use of sprayed pesticides</a> to control the mosquitoes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says they?re the best way to control the disease-spreading insects, and says spraying brought <a href="" type="internal">an outbreak in the nearby Wynwood neighborhood</a> under control.</p>
<p>Mindy Acosta-Leon, 51, of Kendall, Fla., said people should protect themselves, as well.</p>
<p>?It does worry me, I just think the public has to be informed so we can take precautions,? she said. ?I do think that the more we know, the more we?ll take precautions.?</p></article>

<article id="0000543" published-at="2014-01-07" title="Gore?s Odyssey: Another record-breaking freeze, still cult followers cling to climate mythology"><p><a href="" type="internal"></a>Patrick Henningsen <a href="http://wp.me/p3bwni-5UR" type="external">21st Century Wire</a></p>
<p>Cults and technocracies go together it seems, like peanuts and beer.</p>
<p>No matter what is happening in the real world, zealots and mandarins still carry on, filing their green reports, making incredible claims ? in a fit of religious intoxication, in a never-ending compulsive melodrama.&amp;#160;It would be a funny thing, if it weren?t so darn expensive.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>In the United States, a ?polar vortex? has swooped into the Midwest, bringing with it a record freeze. It?s a deadly freeze too, and stark reminder of how low temperatures ? not ?warming?, poses the greatest threat to human survival in the Northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>Still, this reality remains lost on the legions of faithful climate cult followers still clinging to pastor Al Gore?s (image, left) religion of global warming. and the UN?s attempt to implement its climate technocracy, coloured by more&amp;#160; <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2012/09/28/al-gores-drowning-polar-bear-source-reprimanded/" type="external">wild tales of drowning polar bears</a>.</p>
<p>This year?s freeze is no laughing matter. Millions of Americans have been forced into virtual hibernation as a result of the latest arctic wave, which is now pushing its way from Midwest states like Minnesota, down to the south and over to the east coast. It is so cold that skin exposure to sub-zero elements can result in instant frostbite. In&amp;#160;Minneapolis, low temperatures are predicted to reach minus-24 F, with a wind chill factor of minus-50.</p>
<p>While Chicago?s O?Hare International Airport has seen some 1,200 flights canceled as of Monday,&amp;#160;New York?s Kennedy International Airport saw one if its arrivals&amp;#160;on Sunday slide into snow as it turned from an icy runway to taxi. Other incidents have been reported around the country.</p>
<p>This is not the first record-breaking cold snap in recent years. North America hit&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.adn.com/2012/04/21/2434962/record-breaking-winter-is-keeping.html" type="external">record lows in 2012</a>&amp;#160;along with&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igefo63VvzI" type="external">record snow falls</a>, and&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.crh.noaa.gov/eax/?n=20110201blizzsno" type="external">record blizzards and ice storms in 2011</a>&amp;#160;. Before that,&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">2010 saw record low freezes</a>&amp;#160;as well.&amp;#160;In fact, according to the UN own data, the planet has been in a global cooling cycle for the last 16 years.</p>
<p>And no kidding,&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/12/13/snow-egypt-middle-east_n_4438571.html" type="external">it?s snowing in Egypt</a>. <a href="" type="internal"></a> <a href="" type="internal"></a>Cold Snap: Gore?s Odyssey continues (PHOTO: Patrick Henningsen)</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterferrara/2013/05/26/to-the-horror-of-global-warming-alarmists-global-cooling-is-here/" type="external">one report from earlier this year</a>, ?The world added roughly 100 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere between 2000 and 2010. That is about a quarter of all CO2 put there by humanity since 1750. Yet, still no warming during that time. That is because the CO2 ?greenhouse effect? is weak and marginal compared to natural cause of global temperature changes.?</p>
<p>What about the melting polar ice caps? Well,&amp;#160;US space agency NASA has just announced that sea ice around Antarctica (South Pole) has surpassed ??19.47 million square meters as of September ? the highest since measurements began in 1979.</p>
<p>How about the North Pole? Despite it?s earlier attempts to hide this news, the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2415191/And-global-COOLING-Return-Arctic-ice-cap-grows-29-year.html" type="external">UN?s own reports have had to admit</a> how a&amp;#160;chilly Arctic summer has left 533,000 more square miles of ocean covered with ice than last winter ? an increase of 29 per cent.</p>
<p>It should go down in history as the greatest scientific hoax of our times. Gore said many times that, ?the science is settled?, but the reality was that <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jamesdelingpole/100017393/climategate-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-of-anthropogenic-global-warming/" type="external">there was never any science</a> to popular global warming theory.</p>
<p>As the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2415191/And-global-COOLING-Return-Arctic-ice-cap-grows-29-year.html" type="external">UK Mail</a> rightly points out, ?The rebound from 2012?s record low comes six years after the BBC reported that global warming would leave the Arctic ice-free in summer by 2013.? Of course, that 2007 BBC?s report relied on one of those ?green expert?&amp;#160;scientists, Professor Wieslaw Maslowski, who based his conjecture on super-computer models and the fact that ?we use a high-resolution regional model for the Arctic Ocean and sea ice?. Yes, another computer-generated reality.</p>
<p>So where does this leave the global warming zealots who are still insisting that Al Gore and the UN?s IPCC hacks? prophecy of CO2 doom is real?</p>
<p>At some point, even the most faithful cult followers will have to admit they?ve been sold a pup.&amp;#160;The computer-modeled, academic concept man-made CO2-induced global warming, or rather, as it has been rebranded for more flexibility, as ?climate change?, was simply a creation of high-flying think tanks, egged on by bureaucrats and green opportunists who saw new careers and easy billions that could be conjured out of thin air.</p>
<p>The concept of global warming as a tool of economic and social engineering emerged into mainstream policy in 1991, by way of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_of_Rome" type="external">The Club of Rome</a> ?think tank?. In their own words:</p>
<p>?In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill? All these dangers are caused by human intervention? and thus the ?real enemy, then, is humanity itself? believe humanity requires a common motivation, namely a common adversary in order to realize world government. It does not matter if this common enemy is ?a real one or? one invented for the purpose.?</p>
<p>Here was a neatly packaged ideology ready just in time for the UN?s 1992 Earth Summit in&amp;#160;Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>People should consider the ridiculousness ? and complete waste of state money and resources, of still maintaining whole government departments of Climate Change, staffed by ?Climate Bosses?, working to implement more ?Climate Policy? and ?Climate Legislation?. This incredible charade is costing us billions, if not trillions.</p>
<p>Sure, it?s beyond a joke when you look at it all through the lense of reality, but it?s important to understand the context in which this climate drive was put in motion. Aside from the failed <a href="" type="internal">Carbon Trading markets</a>, it was a well-placed distraction at a specific place in time especially in the United States, Australia and Great Britain. Look at the timing of the climate movement which went mainstream in 2003-2005.&amp;#160;By tying up millions of ?green? activists and controlled opposition organisations like Greenpeace, all three of those governments were able to aid industry in making substantial headway in the&amp;#160;hydraulic fracturing shale gas, or ?Fracking? industry ? in a quiet takeover of large areas of rural land and with little or no public resistance. By the time activists copped on, plans were already too far down the road and all the relevant civil servants, politicians and journalists were already bought and paid for. City fat cats and multinational energy consortiums have been laughing ever since.</p>
<p>No Greenpeace ships circling Japan over the Fukushima disaster either. Funny that.</p>
<p>If you want to gauge the disfunctionality and insanity of the Climate Cult, just take at look at how climate&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/8210739/The-climate-bugaboo-is-the-strangest-intellectual-aberration-of-our-age.html" type="external">zealots are now claiming</a>&amp;#160;how, ?global cooling is expected because of global warming?.</p>
<p>Humanity is no stranger to mythology. Climate Change is simply the latest mythology for this current epoch, and the elites who control the mythology have always profited and consolidated their power and social control through it.</p>
<p>In the 21st century, you might have thought modern man would surely have advanced past this handicap, but alas? old habits die hard.</p>

<article id="0000544" published-at="2012-04-19" title="Arizona Independents Demand Non-Partisan State House Replacement"><p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Following the resignation of Tucson Rep. Daniel Patterson, the search is on for a replacement to fill his empty seat in the <a href="" type="internal">Arizona</a> State House. The problem? Arizona <a href="" type="internal">independents</a> are decrying actions made by the Pima County Board of Supervisors, claiming independent citizens are being excluded from the process. The Arizona Independent Candidate Coalition is leading the call for the appointment of an independent representative to the seat.</p>
<p>The issue has stirred up drama in Arizona, where squabbling has occurred over the now former lawmaker?s party registration. <a href="http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2012/04/02/embattled-patterson-leaves-dems-files-as-independent/" type="external">Arizona Capitol Times</a> reports that Patterson had switched his Democratic registration to independent on April 2nd. At the time, Rep. Patterson announced the change on Twitter and said it was to better represent the constituents of Legislative District 29. However last Wednesday, just hours ( <a href="http://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2012/04/12/bennett-supes-must-pick-independent-to-fill-pattersons-seat" type="external">or not</a>) before his resignation, Patterson attempted to <a href="http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2012/04/11/pima-county-dem-chair-patterson-re-registered-as-a-democrat-before-resigning/" type="external">re-registered as a Democrat</a>. He says he was urged by Democratic leadership and took to Twitter to explain:</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Temp. back as D so LD29 appointment can be fair &amp;amp; respect 2010 voter choice. Not my call, but I?m OK w real Indy or D next Rep</p>
<p>? Daniel R. Patterson (@RepPatterson) <a href="https://twitter.com/RepPatterson/status/190606971152510976" type="external">April 13, 2012</a></p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Despite the attempts to switch back to Democrat, Arizona?s Secretary of State determined he had indeed quit an independent. Arizona law requires he be replaced by an nonpartisan.</p>
<p>It?s an interesting dynamic in the state, as Independents in Arizona make up a third of the electorate or over 1.2 million people. According the registration numbers with the Arizona Secretary of State, their numbers are up over 20 percent since elections were held in 2008.</p>
<p>Spearheading the calls for an independent appointment to Legislative District 29 is the Arizona Independent Candidate Coalition, a nascent political committee aiming to ensure the rights of independent voters and candidates.</p>
<p>The Pima County Board of Supervisors have complied a citizens screening panel for the process of bringing forth a candidate for a vacancy. There are two Republicans, two Democrats and one independent on the five-person panel.</p>
<p>?We are deeply disappointed that out of 21,191 independents in Legislative District 29, the supervisors were unable to find five for the citizens screening panel,? said former State Representative Ted Downing, an organizer of the AICC, ?It?s not as if it?s an Easter egg hunt.?</p>
<p>The AICC is supporting independent candidates. Among their top choices is Albert Jordan, an independent ready to serve, according to a statement made by the organization.</p>
<p>The Pima County Board of Supervisors will name the replacement next week, from a list of three names sent from the citizen panel.</p></article>
<article id="0000550" published-at="2008-03-24" title="Drilling Making Alaskans Sick"><p></p>
<p>By now, most of us have heard about how oil and gas drilling does a number on ecosystems. But it?s no good for people, either. By way of the British Columbia online magazine the <a href="http://thetyee.ca/News/2008/03/24/Oil/" type="external">Tyee</a> comes the story of Nuiqsut, a coastal community of 523 people in northern Alaska, about 100 miles west of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</p>
<p>Back in the late ?90s, the oil and gas companies wooed the local Inupiat tribe with promises of jobs and minimal environmental impact?just 14 acres of tribal land would be affected by offshore and land drilling, they said. But now, 14 looks more like 500, and the community is a whole lot worse for the wear, says Rosemary Ahtuangaruak, mayor of Nuiqsut and also a health-care worker:</p>
<p>Since 1986, when she first started working in the health field, the number of people needing medical help to breathe has risen dramatically.</p>
<p>Nuiqsut is 15 metres above sea level on the tundra, and Ahtuangaruak says she can see the natural gas flares from the clinic. The nights when they light up the sky are the same nights she, and other medical staff, can?t leave the clinic for helping people with inhalers, nebulizers, steroids and antibiotics.</p>
<p>The chemicals used in oil and gas extraction, it seems, can irritate the lungs and cause <a href="http://www.earthworksaction.org/Chemicalsandhealth.cfm" type="external">a bunch of other nasty health problems, too.</a></p>
<p>The other thing about drilling: It?s really noisy. Booms as loud as a jet takeoff have scared Nuiqsut?s whales and caribou off, so along with their health, local people are losing their livelihood.</p>
<p>The Canadian government is currently trying to ignore an offshore-drilling moratorium enacted 34 years ago. What can coastal communities expect if officials succeed in wishing away the moratorium? Nuiqsut?s hard times are probably a pretty good indication.</p>

<article id="0000553" published-at="2016-06-11" title="What Investors Missed in the Stock Market This Week"><p></p>
<p>After rising through Wednesday, stocks retreated in the final two trading days of the week, with theDow Jones Industrial Averagemanaging a meager 0.33% gain. TheS&amp;amp;P 500 closed the week 0.15% lower.</p>

<p>The driving force behind the late-week decline seemed to be investor anxiety surrounding a vote that could see the U.K. leave the European Union, combined with a drop in oil prices. These two headlines were enough to send the global markets into a small sell-off Friday. Here are a few stocks making major moves or headlines this week.</p>
<p>Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc.'s investors were hit hard as the stock got pummeled this week, declining more than 20% after it posted another disappointing earnings report. While the first quarter is seasonally slow for the company, its surprise loss of $0.05 per share fell short of analysts' expectations of $0.05 per-share profit. Worse yet, it was a large decline when compared to last year's first-quarter result of $0.23 per share.</p>
<p>In addition to earnings checking in lower than expected, revenue increased 8%, with comparable sales moving 4% higher. This generally would be a silver lining for investors, but the expectations for those metrics were higher, as well. Management was quick to point to headwinds caused by the negative impact of energy and currency on the markets, but also internal issues with supply-chain problems.</p>
<p>All in all, the disappointing quarter led management to reduce its full-year EPS guidance by $0.90 to $1.00, down to a full-year total EPS of between $1.60 and $1.80. This is below analysts' estimates of $2.66.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Restoration Hardware's stock price has dropped 66% in 2016 alone, and value investors looking to swoop in should weigh the risks and rewards. The company has major strategies hanging in the wind, such as launching RH Modern, and moving from a promotional to a membership-selling model using the RH Grey Card.</p>
<p>On the flip side, investors inLDR Holding Corp. are having a fantastic week after the medical-device company, which focuses on treatment of spinal disorders, announced that it's being acquired by Zimmer Biomet Holdings .Looking at the details, Zimmer Biomet put a $1 billion offer on the table to acquire LDR in an all-cash deal. That offer values the shares at $37 each, which was a hefty premium to the stock's closing price on Monday -- hence, the 67% jump for the week.</p>
<p>"This highly strategic and complementary transaction will enhance Zimmer Biomet's innovation leadership in musculoskeletal healthcare by adding a premier spine platform to our portfolio of solutions," said Zimmer Biomet CEO David Dvorak, in a press release.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2016, and Zimmer Biomet expects the acquisition to accelerate the future growth of its total business. Management will update its revenue guidance to reflect the acquisition when the deal closes. While the revenue will be adjusted, investors should temper expectations for incremental earnings per share from the deal -- at least for this year -- as it's expected to be neutral to the bottom line this year, and accretive to EPS in 2017 and thereafter.</p>
<p>Lastly, making headlines late in the trading week was Tesla Motors , and not for good reasons.The Daily Kanban <a href="http://dailykanban.com/2016/06/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/" type="external">broke the news Opens a New Window.</a>, and reported that, in three instances, Tesla owners were at least asked by Tesla to sign "goodwill agreements," often in return for covering out-of-warranty repair costs on some vehicles. The Daily Kanban's post notes that reports <a href="https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/suspension-problem-on-model-s.69204/" type="external">on forums Opens a New Window.</a> have circulated for months about a potential defect in Tesla's suspension, which may cause the suspension control arms to break.</p>

<p>"The agency immediately informed Tesla that any language implying that consumers should not contact the agency regarding safety concerns is unacceptable, and NHTSA expects Tesla to eliminate any such language," said NHTSA spokesman Bryan Thomas, according to Automotive News.Tesla <a href="https://www.teslamotors.com/blog/grain-of-salt" type="external">responded late Opens a New Window.</a> Thursday, giving its side of the situation.</p>
<p>"There is no safety defect with the suspensions in either the Model S or Model X," the company said in a blog post. "On rare occasions when repairs are discounted or conducted for free, customers are asked to sign a "goodwill agreement," Tesla's response continued. "The basic point is to ensure that Tesla doesn't do a good deed, only to have that used against us in court for further gain."</p>
<p>On one hand, an agreement such as this is uncommon in the automotive industry, and rumors of a potential cover-up have fired up across the Internet -- which should initially be taken with a grain of salt in these situations. On the other hand, if there have been injuries or deaths due to the suspension issues, this is a development Tesla investors will want to watch, because it could have serious brand-image and financial impacts.</p>

<article id="0000554" published-at="2017-01-31" title="Everything You Need to Know About Going 360 With Your Feedback"><p></p>

<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>Shockingly, only&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danpontefract/2015/03/31/only-55-percent-of-employees-feel-as-though-performance-management-appraisals-are-effective/#5d1a100e3bb2" type="external">52 percent of companies Opens a New Window.</a>&amp;#160;conduct annual performance reviews. However, there are many approaches a company can take when delivering employee feedback. One&amp;#160;growing option is&amp;#160;360-degree feedback.</p>
<p>When you first hear the term " <a href="http://engagiant.com/blog/the-importance-of-continuous-feedback-in-change-management/" type="external">360-degree feedback Opens a New Window.</a>," you may feel&amp;#160;overwhelmed. It can be a lot of information to handle, and it may sound complicated. Getting your employees used to a 360-degree review process may also take a little effort, but it will ultimately be worth it.</p>
<p>Here are the basics when it comes to&amp;#160;360-degree feedback success:</p>
<p>Understanding 360-Degree Feedback</p>
<p>When it comes down to it, 360-degree feedback is exactly what it sounds like ? feedback from around the circle. It is a system or process in which an employee&amp;#160;receives feedback from multiple sources. These sources are typically colleagues, direct reports, and managers. A&amp;#160;360-degree review will often also include some form of self-evaluation. The goal of this process is to allow the entire team to help each other develop skills and address any potential weaknesses.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>There are multiple&amp;#160;benefits when transitioning to a 360-degree feedback system,&amp;#160;including the following:</p>
<p>1. Open Channels Of Communication</p>
<p>Adopting the 360-degree feedback system allows employees in the company to comment on each other's work. This fosters a communication-rich environment in which it is easy to address and resolve problems.</p>
<p>The overall communication process is improved, and issues that could potentially cause problems are often solved before they cause any damage. Effective communication makes an organization&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.roomtoescape.com/blog/12-statistics-that-show-the-importance-of-effective-corporate-team-building" type="external">4.5 times more likely Opens a New Window.</a> to retain its&amp;#160;best employees.</p>
<p>2. Better Feedback From Multiple Sources</p>
<p>Receiving feedback from peers, supervisors, and oneself allows for a more well-rounded and substantial review compared to a process that relies on feedback from just one individual. Employees are able to receive feedback more frequently, and peer feedback is just as beneficial as feedback received from superiors. In fact,&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.trakstar.com/blog-post/7-facts-you-need-to-know-before-giving-employee-feedback/" type="external">88 percent of employees who receive peer feedback are happier with their jobs Opens a New Window.</a>.</p>
<p>A 360-degree&amp;#160;review also allows trends and patterns to become clear. For example, let's say an employee is always looking for different ways to help other departments and collaborate. While a supervisor might not have seen any&amp;#160;of this, colleagues from these departments would be able to praise the employee for their hard work. In this case, a 360-degree feedback process allows team members to recognize good work that may have otherwise gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>3. Team Development</p>
<p>The 360-degree feedback approach helps team members work more effectively together. Team members who give each other feedback create a sense of accountability when providing their input on each member's performance. A well-implemented 360-degree system can allow for improved team communication and development. Team communication is important, with <a href="http://govitru.com/workplace-statistics/" type="external">33 percent of employees Opens a New Window.</a> saying a lack of open, honest communication has the most negative impact on employee morale.</p>
<p>4. Career Development</p>
<p>A 360-degree feedback process provides employees with excellent information about what they&amp;#160;need to do in order to further their careers. It also keeps them engaged in their current roles: <a href="http://www.businessperform.com/blog/2010/10/05/gallup-employee-feedback-358.html" type="external">98 percent of employees Opens a New Window.</a> say managers who give them little or no feedback fail to engage them. A 360-degree process gives an employee many opportunities to&amp;#160;learn what they are doing well and how they could improve.</p>
<p>What Are the Downsides of a&amp;#160;360-Degree Review?</p>
<p>For all the benefits, a 360-degree review process also has its downsides. It is important to understand these shortfalls because they can offer us a map of what to avoid when practicing 360-degree reviews.</p>
<p>1. What an Employee Decides to Do After the Process</p>
<p>In order for the 360-degree review process to be successful, an employee must be able to do a few things along the way. It can be overwhelming to receive large amounts of feedback all at once. If the information is to be useful, an employee must be able to understand the feedback, process it, and determine next steps.</p>
<p>Taking a <a href="https://engagiant.com/blog/microfeedback-beyond-technology/" type="external">microfeedback Opens a New Window.</a> approach might be able to help here. Integrating this process into a complete performance management system makes employees accountable for following up and acting on the feedback provided by others.</p>
<p>2. Focusing on What Is Wrong</p>
<p>People tend to focus on the negative remarks rather than the positive during performance reviews. That means many employees focus on fixing their weaknesses. While it is important to address performance shortfalls, employees should also pay attention to the positive aspects of their reviews. Maximizing one's strengths has been shown to be rewarding, and it will certainly advance your team in the right direction.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.clearcompany.com/ignore-these-performance-management-stats-at-your-own-risk" type="external">A reported 25 percent of employees Opens a New Window.</a> leave organizations due to lack of recognition. Try to emphasize the positives while giving feedback in the 360-degree review process. (Make sure to address weaknesses as well!) Encouraging employees to pursue their strengths will help counteract negative feelings.</p>
<p>3. Sticking to the Process</p>
<p>A 360-degree review is not a one-time event. This process should be implemented on a regular basis. Building a strong feedback culture can help when implementing 360-degree reviews.</p>
<p>Try to make feedback a daily habit. Then, when it comes time for the routine 360-degree feedback, the review process will be easier to implement and employees won't be overwhelmed. Use the feedback to create an action plan, and you will start to see an employee-driven process.</p>
<p>?</p>
<p>Every performance feedback system has its potential pitfalls, and the 360-degree process is no different. However, it can create a positive and powerful problem-solving environment when carried out correctly.</p>
<p>The 360-degree process can help increase employee engagement, company morale, and productivity levels. Given that only&amp;#160; <a href="http://blog.clearcompany.com/ignore-these-performance-management-stats-at-your-own-risk" type="external">32.5 percent of U.S. employees report Opens a New Window.</a> being engaged at work,&amp;#160;it may be time to take a chance on going 360!</p>

<article id="0000559" published-at="2017-11-12" title="Better Buy: Exelixis, Inc. vs. Novartis AG"><p>Novartis (NYSE: NVS) stands out as one of the biggest pharma companies with a broad array of products, including several of the most powerful cancer drugs on the market. Exelixis (NASDAQ: EXEL) only has three products on the market right now, but it ranks as one of the most promising rising stars in the treatment of cancer.</p>
<p>If you bought shares of both stocks, you'd be much happier with Exelixis so far in 2017. The biotech's share price has soared more than 70% year to date, while Novartis stock is up less than 15%. But which of these stocks is the better pick now? Here's how Exelixis and Novartis compare.</p>
<p>Continue Reading Below</p>
<p>Exelixis has three currently approved products: Cabometyx, Cometriq, and Cotellic. Technically, however, Cabometyx and Cometriq are two forms of the same drug,&amp;#160;cabozantinib. The most important of the three, by far, is Cabometyx. Exelixis won Food and Drug Administration approval for the drug in 2016 for patients with previously treated renal cell carcinoma (RCC).</p>
<p>The biggest opportunities for Cabometyx could be just around the corner, though. The FDA is scheduled to make an approval decision for the drug as a first-line RCC treatment by Feb. 15, 2018. Exelixis also plans to file for approval of Cabometyx in treating&amp;#160;advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer, in the first quarter of 2018.</p>
<p>Novartis has too many products to name one by one. The big pharma company is organized into three segments: innovative medicines, Sandoz, and Alcon. Innovative medicines markets a number of drugs, with especially strong growth for autoimmune disease drug Cosentyx and heart failure drug Entresto. Sandoz sells biosimilars and generic drugs. Alcon market surgical and vision-care products.</p>
<p>In August, Novartis' Kymriah became the first chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy to win FDA approval. CAR-T is an exciting area of cancer research, and Novartis ranks as a top leader in the field. But while the company has great new products like Kymriah, sales for some of its older products, particularly cancer drug Gleevec, are declining in the face of generic competition.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Other than the late-stage studies on which Exelixis' first-line RCC and advanced HCC regulatory filings are based, the only other clinical trial the biotech is itself sponsoring is a late-stage study in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb. Exelixis and BMS are evaluating Cabometyx in combination with either Opdivo or Yervoy as a first-line treatment for RCC.</p>
<p>However, there are quite a few other clinical studies underway that are being conducted by other parties. Cabometyx is being evaluated in combination with other drugs in treating various types of cancer. Also, Exelixis' partner, Roche, has several studies in progress with Cotellic in combination with Tecentriq in treating different cancers.</p>
<p>Novartis' pipeline includes more than 200 programs in clinical development. Late-stage studies are underway targeting additional cancer indications for Kymriah. The company has new drugs for treating diseases including multiple sclerosis, breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, Cushing's disease, and sickle cell disease that could be submitted for regulatory approval in 2018.</p>
<p>Both Exelixis and Novartis are profitable. However, Exelixis' revenue and earnings are growing strongly, while Novartis' revenue growth has stalled and its earnings are slipping due to generic competition for older products.</p>
<p>Novartis has the bigger cash stockpile, with $9.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, commodities, and derivatives at the end of the third quarter. Exelixis reported a cash position of $149.4 million at the end of the third quarter.</p>
<p>Also, Novartis' strong cash flow allows it to pay out a dividend to shareholders. The dividend currently yields 3.3%. Exelixis, like most other biotechs, doesn't pay a dividend.</p>
<p>Which of these two stocks is the better buy? It depends entirely on what your investing style is.</p>
<p>If you're seeking income, go with Novartis. If you're a value investor, you'll probably find Novartis more to your liking. But if you want growth, pick Exelixis.</p>
<p>My personal choice is Exelixis. I like the potential for Cabometyx. The biotech should be able to use the cash spun off from this successful franchise to build its pipeline and grow even more over the long run. I also view Exelixis as a prime acquisition target for larger companies wanting to beef up their oncology portfolio.</p>

<article id="0000562" published-at="2018-01-16" title="Oladipo scores 28, hot-shooting Pacers beat Jazz 109-94"><p>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) ? Offense trumped defense on a night when one of the NBA?s most efficient offensive teams met one of the top defensive units.</p>
<p>Victor Oladipo scored 28 points and the Indiana Pacers shot 54 percent from 3-point range in a 109-94 win over the Utah Jazz on Monday.</p>
<p>?Execution,? Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. ?We talked about establishing our pace, but controlling the tempo. We didn?t want to get in an up-and-down game and allow the crowd to get into the game. Our guys did a nice job of taking opportunities early when we had them. And if we didn?t, we made them defend and were able to execute and score.</p>
<p>?Guys have confidence. When we get good ball movement and we?re sharing the ball, we shoot the ball a lot better.?</p>
<p>Oladipo got going late in the second quarter during a 15-2 run that gave Indiana a 14-point lead. Then his back-to-back buckets early in the third capped a 9-0 surge to push the advantage to 67-47. He also had six rebounds and six assists.</p>
<p>?Guys were getting wide-open shots,? Oladipo said. ?Guys shooting the ball with confidence.</p>
<p>?Just ball movement, getting the right shot, making the right play. Most of all, defensively, making it tough on them.?</p>
<p>Domantas Sabonis finished with 15 points and eight rebounds for the Pacers, and Thaddeus Young scored 17.</p>
<p>Donovan Mitchell scored 23 for the struggling Jazz, while Derrick Favors added 16 points and seven rebounds. Utah has lost 15 of 19.</p>
<p>?We?re not playing with a lot of confidence on offense right now, both individually and collectively,? coach Quin Snyder said. ?If that?s the case, you can?t force that. You just got to connect even more and, in some respects, it puts more pressure on your offense.</p>
<p>?But that pressure can?t be felt by any one guy. It?s got to be collective. When you turn the ball over, that?s not confidence. That?s just, we have to be more mentally tough.?</p>
<p>The Jazz put themselves in a hole with seven first-quarter turnovers, but rallied with a 14-0 spurt in the second to cut the deficit to 38-37. They never got that close again.</p>
<p>The Pacers were efficient on offense all night, shooting 53 percent from the field and 14 of 26 from 3-point territory. Indiana is 15-0 when shooting better than 50 percent.</p>
<p>?There were times we just didn?t talk to each other and I think that?s the biggest thing,? Mitchell said about Utah?s defense. ?We?ve got to be able to talk and communicate and understand.?</p>
<p>TIP-INS</p>
<p>Pacers: Indiana began the night ranked second in the NBA in 3-point shooting at 38.3 percent.</p>
<p>Jazz: Raul Neto returned from a 15-game absence due to a concussion and bruised left knee. ... Rudy Gobert went through an extensive workout with braces on both knees before the game. He?s thought to be close to returning from a left PCL sprain and bone bruise.</p>
<p>TURNER OUT</p>
<p>Pacers center Myles Turner did not play due to a ligament sprain and muscle strain in his right elbow. He will not play the remaining three games of the road trip. The team lists him as week-to-week depending on how quickly Turner heals, but said he will not need surgery.</p>
<p>SEFOLOSHA?S STATUS</p>
<p>Jazz forward Thabo Sefolosha has been diagnosed with a serious right knee sprain and wore a bulky brace before the game. The team has not announced a timeline for his return, but there are fears it could be a long-term injury.</p>
<p>QUOTABLE</p>
<p>?He?s a very confident kid with a lot of talent,? McMillan said of Oladipo. ?We knew that he had potential in making the move to trade him for Paul (George). He?s showing pretty much what I think the league expected him to become. He?s come out very aggressive this season. I think he feels he has something to prove to not only himself, but to the league.?</p>
<p>UP NEXT</p>
<p>Pacers: Travel to face Damian Lillard and the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday.</p>
<p>Jazz: Travel to play Zach Randolph and the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Donovan Mitchell scored 23 for the struggling Jazz, while Derrick Favors added 16 points and seven rebounds. Utah has lost 15 of 19.</p>
<p>?We?re not playing with a lot of confidence on offense right now, both individually and collectively,? coach Quin Snyder said. ?If that?s the case, you can?t force that. You just got to connect even more and, in some respects, it puts more pressure on your offense.</p>
<p>?But that pressure can?t be felt by any one guy. It?s got to be collective. When you turn the ball over, that?s not confidence. That?s just, we have to be more mentally tough.?</p>
<p>The Jazz put themselves in a hole with seven first-quarter turnovers, but rallied with a 14-0 spurt in the second to cut the deficit to 38-37. They never got that close again.</p>
<p>The Pacers were efficient on offense all night, shooting 53 percent from the field and 14 of 26 from 3-point territory. Indiana is 15-0 when shooting better than 50 percent.</p>
<p>?There were times we just didn?t talk to each other and I think that?s the biggest thing,? Mitchell said about Utah?s defense. ?We?ve got to be able to talk and communicate and understand.?</p>
<p>TIP-INS</p>
<p>Pacers: Indiana began the night ranked second in the NBA in 3-point shooting at 38.3 percent.</p>
<p>Jazz: Raul Neto returned from a 15-game absence due to a concussion and bruised left knee. ... Rudy Gobert went through an extensive workout with braces on both knees before the game. He?s thought to be close to returning from a left PCL sprain and bone bruise.</p>
<p>TURNER OUT</p>
<p>Pacers center Myles Turner did not play due to a ligament sprain and muscle strain in his right elbow. He will not play the remaining three games of the road trip. The team lists him as week-to-week depending on how quickly Turner heals, but said he will not need surgery.</p>
<p>SEFOLOSHA?S STATUS</p>
<p>Jazz forward Thabo Sefolosha has been diagnosed with a serious right knee sprain and wore a bulky brace before the game. The team has not announced a timeline for his return, but there are fears it could be a long-term injury.</p>
<p>QUOTABLE</p>
<p>?He?s a very confident kid with a lot of talent,? McMillan said of Oladipo. ?We knew that he had potential in making the move to trade him for Paul (George). He?s showing pretty much what I think the league expected him to become. He?s come out very aggressive this season. I think he feels he has something to prove to not only himself, but to the league.?</p>
<p>UP NEXT</p>
<p>Pacers: Travel to face Damian Lillard and the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday.</p>
<p>Jazz: Travel to play Zach Randolph and the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday.</p>

<article id="0000566" published-at="2016-12-19" title="Snowflake Alert: Guess Who's Most Likely to Block You On Social Media Over Political Views"><p>A new <a href="http://www.prri.org/research/poll-post-election-holiday-war-christmas/" type="external">study</a>conducted by Public Religion Research Institute has revealed some unsurprising findings about the Party of Tolerance: Democrats are more likely than Republicans to block or unfriend those they disagree with politically on social media, with Democratic women leading the pack as most likely to block political foes.</p>
<p>The study, which reviewed over 1,000 respondents' answers, found that "13% of the public say they blocked, unfriended, or stopped following someone on social media because of what they posted about politics."</p>
<p>Democratic women were found to be the most block-happy, with 30 percent of female Democrats admitting to blocking or unfriending those with differing political views; while male Democrats came a close second with 14 percent.</p>
<p>Republicans overall were far less likely to censor the views surrounding them: Less than one in ten Republicans engaged in blocking or unfriending on social media over politics, with Republican women slightly more inclined to block than their male counterparts at 10 percent and 8 percent respectively.</p>
<p>Again, this is wholly unsurprising. The Democrat Party has become increasingly intolerant, most notably on college campuses and "protest" spaces. In recent years, leftists have called for "safe spaces," the censorship of so-called "hate speech" and have violently "protested" the democratic election of Republican Donald Trump and speakers with whom they disagree with, such as Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro.</p>
<p>Censorship is the name of the game in Leftist Land.</p>

<article id="0000572" published-at="2005-07-06" title="Thursday Edition: Energy Drinks and Kids"><p></p>
<p>The other day, my 12-year-old daughter and I stopped at the gas station/market and she wanted to buy one of those <a href="http://www.druginfo.adf.org.au/article.asp?ContentID=energy_drinks" type="external">energy drinks</a> that have become so popular. "What could be wrong with something called an 'energy drink'?" I thought, then my wife suggested that the energy might be coming from tons of sugar or caffeine that would have our kids talking like Daffy Duck. I suggested that we might find something else. I started looking around and found a good bit of concern over kids and energy drinks.&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.redbull.co.uk/faq.action#9" type="external">Even Red Bull, one of the most popular drink companies, says:</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is important to note that children are the only group that we specifically do not target as we believe that they do not need that extra boost of energy (most children already have that natural 'exuberance'!)It is generally considered that products containing caffeine are not particularly suitable for young children. The real problem with this is that it is not possible to categorically state at which age someone is no longer a child in this situation. For example, if a child is already consuming caffeine-based products such as tea, coffee, colas or other energy drinks, there is no real reason why they should not be able to drink Red Bull. However, sensitivity to caffeine is subjective no matter if you are a child or a fully grown adult. One adult person might be able to drink 2-3 cans without getting the same feelings as those associated with drinking too much caffeine, whereas another adult will drink&amp;#160;one can and feel that they shouldn't drink another that day. Caffeine sensitivity is very personalized.</p>
<p>The best guideline we can offer is that if a child already drinks coffee, tea or colas etc., then there is no reason&amp;#160;they shouldn't drink Red Bull. This is the&amp;#160;amount of caffeine in Red Bull (80mg) compared to that of another soft drink (for instance a cola, which contains roughly 33mg of caffeine.) Red Bull therefore contains roughly 2? times the caffeine in a can of cola.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2005/253.html" type="external">FoodProcessing.com</a> reports:</p>
<p>The two beverage segments (sports drinks and energy drinks) appealed initially to young and active rather than simply "athletic" males, but recently have become more popular with women and teenagers.</p>
<p>An <a href="http://www.choice.com.au/viewArticle.aspx?id=102495&amp;amp;catId=100406&amp;amp;tid=100008&amp;amp;p=3" type="external">Australian consumer group says:</a></p>
<p>Twenty-seven percent&amp;#160;of 8?12-year-old boys, 12 percent&amp;#160;of 8?12-year-old girls, 24 percent&amp;#160;of 12?18-year-old boys and 20 percent&amp;#160;of 12?18-year-old girls had had at least one energy drink in the two weeks prior to the survey. It's thought that parents may also be buying these drinks for their kids, probably under the misguided assumption that they're better than soft drinks because they're called energy drinks.</p>
<p>These drinks are particularly high in caffeine, and it only takes one or two cans to give kids more than the amount that's been reported to cause increased anxiety. And if they had the 'dosage' recommended for some of the products of five cans a day, they'd also get enough to increase blood pressure and heart rate (and even cause palpitations), along with jitters and possible sleep disturbances. They can also suffer withdrawal symptoms (headaches and lethargy) when they stop taking in caffeine.</p>
<p>The article continues:</p>
<p>A further study found that some teenagers are drinking up to five cans of energy drink before sporting events, believing it will boost their performance. Energy drinks shouldn't be confused with sports drinks, which are designed to maximize hydration. The caffeine content of energy drinks has the opposite effect&amp;#160;-- it dehydrates. At such levels, caffeine can increase diastolic blood pressure and heart rate (sometimes with palpitations) and provoke feelings of anxiety. It would also be enough to disqualify athletes from some formal competition. And while caffeine is known to enhance performance in sport, at levels of about 200?300 mg, its diuretic effect could be a considerable disadvantage.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tonganoxiemirror.com/section/living/story/7887" type="external">The Tonganoxie (Kansas)&amp;#160;Mirror</a> did a terrific story on high school athletes who drink this stuff before and even during a game.&amp;#160;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/jan2005/sb2005015_8196_sb017.htm" type="external">Business Week says</a> the $2-a-can energy drink market is packed with competitors who are going after the youth market in a big way.</p>
<p>The target market for energy drinks is mostly male teenagers and twentysomethings, a notoriously fickle bunch. So unlike the cola market, where Coke and Pepsi push their offerings to all soda-drinkers, most of the smaller power-drink players have decided that their best hope of gaining traction is by appealing to very specialized market segments. "Right now there's an ability to get a toehold more quickly if you can build loyalty with a niche of the market," says Kelly O'Keefe, CEO of brand-consulting firm Emergence, based in Atlanta. "The margins are high enough that you can make money on a small run of the product." Drinks have been aimed at consumers interested in extreme sports (Red Bull, Go Fast!), video games (Bawls Guarana, which sponsors gaming tournaments and encourages players to pull all-nighters), hip-hop (Crunk!!!, Pimp Juice, and DefCon 3), and even marijuana, courtesy of Merrilville (Ind.)-based brand Bong Water.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/psych/sub/maher.htm" type="external">Maher Karam-Hage</a>, M.D., an addiction specialist at the University of Michigan Health System, raises some concerns about the beverages, particularly when they are mixed with alcohol, ingested before intensive exercise or used by children. "In the United States, these energy drinks have not had any warnings. In Europe, it's been more cautionary," says Karam-Hage, medical director of the Chelsea-Arbor Treatment Center, a joint program of the U-M Health System and Chelsea Community Hospital. He notes that France has banned some of the drinks and other countries have placed restrictions on them. "In this country, our advertisements for these drinks and the marketing are ahead of the science." <a href="http://www.redbullusa.com/extras/ingredients.jsp" type="external">The energy drinks typically contain sugar, caffeine (often 80 mg per can, about the same as a cup of coffee),</a> and taurine, a sulfur-containing amino acid. Some countries have raised concerns about the amount of caffeine in the drinks and the uncertain health effects of taurine. Energy drinks are different from sports drinks, which tend not to have caffeine or taurine and are lower in carbohydrates. While Karam-Hage stops short of saying people never should consume energy drinks, he says that mixing them with alcohol is dangerous and should be avoided. "The best analogy I can come up with is it's the same as driving a car, putting one foot on the gas and one foot on the brakes," he says of combining the stimulants in caffeine and the intoxicating effects of alcohol.</p>
<p>Popping the Gum Market <a href="http://www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/living/12064899.htm" type="external">The (Ft. Worth) Star-Telegram</a></p>
<p>The gum market is expanding, stretching out in two new definitive directions: health-enhancing chews and unusual flavors.</p>
<p>New so-called functional gums for adults lean toward the medicinal as they become the latest "delivery systems" for a variety of nutrients, caffeine and herbs. Their function is not necessarily in their taste or texture.</p>
<p>Emerging as well are startling and exotic flavors, including a hot and spicy mango-curry gum base just created by a European manufacturer (not yet for sale in the United States), and the limited availability sugar-free chocolate gum by O'lala Foods of Chicago. Gum marketeers also are hoping to capture the attention of kids with more intense flavors, as well as with blended-fruit flavors not found in nature, as in the surprising "grapermelon" from Juicy Fruit.</p>
<p>Why the sudden pop of interest in gum? Americans spend $3.3 billion a year on the sticky stuff. About half of us chew gum, and those who choose to chew gnaw an average of 170 pieces a year. But gum sales and snack sales have not been increasing at a rate that pleases producers.</p>

<p>The Plymouth-Canton school board voted unanimously June 28 to consider commercial naming opportunities for everything from the new school to athletic fields to events such as the prom.</p>
<p>It's not exactly a first: A school district in New Jersey sold the naming rights to its high school gymnasium to a local Shop-Rite, while the Grapevine-Colleyville school district in Texas has offered advertising space on school buses, sporting venues and a middle-school roof.</p>
<p>Sponsorship experts say it's hard to pin down a number for naming rights to a school because of the many variables -- size of district and wealth of community, for example -- but officials in Plymouth-Canton said that if they pursued a sponsor they'd seek a 51 percent investment, meaning a marketer would probably have to pony up $7.5 million of the $15 million cost of building the new elementary school.</p>
<p>But replacing George Washington Junior High or Martin Luther King Magnet School with Fed-Ex Elementary or Nike Public School is taking the trend to a new -- and to some, troubling -- stage.</p>
<p>"What this issue is, first of all, is the way we have abandoned public space and the notion of the public good," said psychologist Susan Linn, co-founder of the Boston-based <a href="http://www.commercialexploitation.org/" type="external">Campaign for Commercial-Free Childhood</a>. "People don't see the cost, and the cost is our values and the values we are passing onto children."</p>
<p>The story continues:</p>
<p>From the secondary level to the university level there has been a sense that commercialization -- already common on the athletic field, where even pizza magnate Papa John has an eponymous football stadium at the University of Louisville, for instance -- is creeping into the classroom.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, Temple University is considering selling naming rights to its new $150 million medical school and research facility. The idea, backed by some, including the medical school dean, has drawn outrage from others who see a clear difference between naming schools and buildings after donations from influential alumni, philanthropists and foundations, and selling naming rights to marketers.&amp;#160;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Last month, hundreds of boisterous protesters converged in Washington, DC, as the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Hollingsworth v. Perry, the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of California?s anti-gay marriage initiative, Proposition 8. Faith-based groups were on prominent display: the Methodists supporting marriage equality, the <a href="" type="internal">Westboro Baptists</a> suggesting (per usual) that ?God hates fags,? the Catholics both for and against gay marriage, clergy of all stripes. But one group that wasn?t there in any official capacity was the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints?a.k.a. the Mormons?which perhaps more than any other religious group was responsible for getting Prop. 8 passed in the first place.</p>
<p>In the five years since the LDS church sent busloads of the faithful to California to canvass neighborhoods, and contributed more than $20 million via its members to support the initiative, it has all but dropped the rope in the public policy tug of war over marriage equality. The change stems from an even more remarkable if somewhat invisible transformation happening within the church, prompted by the ugly fight over Prop. 8 and the ensuing backlash from the flock.</p>
<p>Although the LDS?s prophet hasn?t described a holy revelation directing a revision in church doctrine on same-sex marriage or gay rights in general, the church has shown a rare capacity for introspection and humane cultural change unusual for a large conservative religious organization.</p>
<p>?It seems like the [Mormon] hierarchy has pulled the plug and is no longer taking the lead in the fight to stop same-sex marriage,? says <a href="" type="internal">Fred Karger</a>, the LGBT activist who first exposed the church?s major role in the passage of Prop. 8. ?The Mormon Church has lost so many members and suffered such a black eye because of all its anti-gay activities that they really had no choice. I am hopeful that the Catholic Church cannot be far behind.?</p>
<p>The LDS church has been a driving force against gay-marriage initiatives since at least 1995. It was instrumental in fending off same-sex marriage in Hawaii and Alaska and, in 2000, it helped pass California?s Proposition 22 (the Prop. 8 precursor known as the Knight Initiative), which defined marriage as solely between a man and woman. (Prop. 22 was struck down by the California Supreme Court in 2008.)</p>
<p>The church?s anti-gay positions and lobbying on gay marriage have always been divisive. In 2000, during the fight over the Knight Initiative, a young gay Mormon named Stuart Matis killed himself on the steps of a Mormon ward in Los Altos, California. In a letter to his cousin shortly before his suicide, he despaired over the impact of the church?s political activities on Mormon families: ?On the night of March 7th, many California couples will retire to their beds thrilled that they helped pass the Knight Initiative. What they don?t realize is that in the next room, their son or daughter is lying in bed crying and could very well one day be the victim of society?s homophobia. The Knight Initiative will certainly save no family. It is codified hatred. It is anti-family, anti-love and it is wrong.?</p>
<p>But Matis? death didn?t slow the church?s efforts to beat back same-sex marriage initiatives. In 2008, after the California Supreme Court briefly legalized gay marriage in the state, the Latter Day Saints lent their formidable organizing skills and networks to the Prop. 8 effort, sending canvassers door to door by zip code?sometimes as many as 25,000 per weekend?much as they send out missionaries to spread the Gospel. The church has been credited with almost single-handedly getting Prop. 8 passed, despite a well-funded opposition with backing from Hollywood.</p>
<p>Prop. 8 was a Pyrrhic victory for the Mormons, however. Their role, which the church sought to keep under wraps, was exposed by Karger, who tracked the individual donations pouring into the Yes on 8 campaign back to church members. LGBT activists responded by publicizing the church?s involvement, running an ad, for example, showing fake Mormon missionaries knocking on the door of a lesbian couple and then rifling through their drawers and tearing up their marriage license.</p>
<p>The negative exposure prompted protests, and many Mormons publicly renounced their church membership. One of them was then 28-year-old Matthew Lawrence, the son of official LDS pollster Gary Lawrence, who had led the Prop. 8 fight. ?I love my family so much, but it?s hard to not take this personally. We had a brief falling-out over Prop. 22, but that got mended. But two anti-gay initiatives in eight years, it?s impossible not to feel attacked,? Matthew, who is gay, wrote in 2008.</p>
<p>The LDS church had always struggled for public acceptance, and the negative press wasn?t helping. One poll, conducted a year after Prop. 8 passed, showed that the church?s favorability rating had fallen from 42 percent to 37 percent. But its image problem was nothing compared to the internal rifts the Mormons were experiencing. ?The church probably deserved the black eye we got from Prop. 8,? says Mitch Mayne, an openly gay Mormon leader in the San Francisco area. ?What the non-Mormon world didn?t get to see was how destructive that was inside the faith.?</p>
<p>In response to the anger within Mormon ranks over Prop. 8, the president of the Oakland, California, stake (a stake is akin to a Catholic diocese) began organizing&amp;#160;gatherings of gay and straight members to try to bridge the differences. In September 2010, the disgruntled church members received a private audience with one of the church?s top officials, Marlin Jensen, who serves as the LDS?s historian. The church members tearfully told Jensen their stories?of being shunned by their families, and the homophobia generated by the Prop. 8 campaign. ?We explained that [the church had] pitted father against son, mother against daughter, exactly the opposite of what we stand for,? says Mayne, who attended the meeting.</p>
<p>After listening to them talk, Jensen did something almost unheard of in a church whose strict authoritarian hierarchy is unaccustomed to being challenged from below: He apologized ?for the pain that Prop. 8 caused [us],? Mayne recalls, choking up at the memory. It was, he says, a ?very meaningful event.?</p>
<p>The apology from a high church official turned out to be just the beginning of a cultural shift toward greater acceptance of gays and lesbians within LDS ranks. In 2011, Mayne was called to serve as an official of his local San Francisco ward, as an openly gay man. It was a historic appointment in an institution with a long history of excommunicating openly gay members, which it referred to as people who were ?afflicted? with same-sex attraction.</p>
<p>Since then, the church has opened its doors to LGBT members in many places, Mayne says: ?Everybody is welcome here. Nobody is under that threat of being excommunicated.? In 2012, the church even created a website, <a href="http://www.mormonsandgays.org" type="external">Mormonsandgays.org</a>, to convey its desire for more-humane treatment of LGBT members. Also last year, about 300 straight Mormons marched in the Salt Lake City pride parade, a significant and emotional first. Mayne says the new website, like the church, still has a long way to go, but he and other gay Mormons see it as a step in the right direction.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Perhaps most significantly, the church has made a concerted effort to bring LGBT kids back into the fold. Mayne points out that gay Mormon kids have significantly higher suicide rates than gay non-Mormon ones?a problem that has been attributed to the church?s longtime policy of forcing parents of gay kids to choose between their church and their children. It also has long been common practice for Mormon parents to kick LGBT adolescents out of their homes because of their sexual orientation. (When Matt Lawrence, the church pollster?s son, broke with his family over Prop. 8, he told stories about his family?s efforts to ?straighten me out? by sending him to live with homophobic cousins in Utah.) Utah foster parents, too, generally <a href="" type="internal">won?t take in LGBT children</a>. That?s one reason why heavily Mormon Utah has so many homeless LGBT kids on the streets. But even that is starting to change.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>The church has worked with the Family Acceptance Project at San Francisco State University to craft an educational booklet aimed specifically at helping Mormons parent their gay kids, to keep them safe at home and to prevent suicide. It?s a remarkably humane document instructing church members on how to embrace their gay kids even when they?re uncomfortable with their purple hair and transgendered friends. The pamphlet is now being used in lots of Mormon wards. Meanwhile, in Salt Lake City, where the church is headquartered, the church has teamed up with the&amp;#160;LGBT&amp;#160;community to open a shelter for young homeless people there, about 40 percent of whom are known to be&amp;#160;LGBT.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>?The LGBT community had reached out to the church several times before Prop. 8 and we?ve never been able to connect,? says Jim Dabakis, head of the Utah Democratic Party and cofounder of the Utah Pride Center in Salt Lake, who has been involved in these conversations. But after the Prop. 8 backlash, the Utah LGBT community, along with national leaders, commenced a series of meetings with church hierarchy. The first meetings were ?a bit uncomfortable,?&amp;#160;Dabakis recalls. But then, ?as we began to meet, and we began to introduce our families, it became much less an issue about legal points, what is the definition of a family, what kind of overarching legal principals are involved, and much more about Christian values and how people should be treated. Minds changed on both sides.?</p>
<p>Not everything has changed, of course. The church still filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in support of Prop. 8, although it doesn?t read like the same sort of full-throated anti-gay sentiment that drove the initiative. The church lawyers who drafted the document seem to have bent over backward to express how much they like gays, and to frame the issue in terms of states? rights, as opposed to morality.</p>
<p>Mormon church doctrine still defines homosexuality as a sin. The gay Mormon website clarifies that while having a same-sex attraction is not a sin, acting on it is. Mayne was only able to take on his leadership role in the church after he broke up with his longtime partner and was single again. And noncelibate LGBT members are still excluded from ?temple recommends??access to the church?s most sacred spaces and ceremonies.</p>
<p>Dabakis says that there are still many points of disagreement. ?I don?t think the church has given one iota on gay marriage?maybe they never will?and neither have we. On the other hand, we have found a lot of commonalities that we can work on,? he says, pointing towards the joint efforts to help homeless kids.</p>
<p>The LGBT community?s best evidence of change within the church is that last year, in the only four states ever to pass marriage equality laws, the church ?did not provide one dime or one volunteer,? Dabakis says. He adds that in Maryland, when one local Mormon leader tried to organize to oppose a pro-marriage-equality initiative, the church shut her down.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules in the Prop. 8 case, the church responsible for its passage has been permanently changed for the better. In Mayne?s view, this all means that Prop. 8, with all its ugliness, happened for a reason: ?I believe in our attempt to nail shut the Pandora?s box of gay marriage, we essentially blew the lid off of it.?</p>

<p>?Shortly after adopting the first of my four children we noticed that he seemed a little bit different from other infants,? recalled Elizabeth Pflaum in her e-mail to FOXBusiness.com. She said she soon found out that her son suffered from developmental disorders.</p>
<p>Finding someone who could help her better understand her son?s conditions was a struggle for Pflaum.</p>
<p>?I could find great occupational therapists, psychiatrists, speech therapists, psychopharmacologists, special education advocates and attorneys, social workers and tutors, but I couldn?t find anyone who actually could offer a common sense approach to living with my son?s challenges,? she wrote.</p>
<p>So Pflaum said she sought out the training and certification she needed to become the service provider she was once desperate to find.</p>

<p>?Today, I work with parents all over the country offering telephone coaching, in-person coaching, tele-seminars, workshops, and classes,? she wrote.</p>
<p>She said she enjoys running a business that helps parents handle challenges and frustrations similar to those she has endured while raising her son.</p>
<p>?By the time my clients reach me, they are usually feeling as hopeless and overwhelmed as I once felt, and I am always so grateful for the opportunity to help them to create their own happy ending for their children and their families.?</p>

<p>Dave House launched his startup, Tiamet Communications, in an effort to help his wife when she went back to college. As he explained in an e-mail to FOXBusiness.com, ?She was taking some online courses and couldn't take the exams online because we didn't have a broadband connection.?</p>
<p>With the help of his family and knowledgeable friends, House figured out how to bring high speed Internet to his rural area of Virginia. ?We put all our money into our WISP/ISP venture, including literally mortgaging the farm. We struggled to make all the payments every month and are still just above breaking even,? wrote House.</p>
<p>The year after the business started, House found himself facing another challenge.</p>
<p>?We almost lost all of this in November of 2007,? wrote House. ?I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Even with insurance, the bills finally forced us into bankruptcy. Working with our attorney and accountant we were able to save our home and the business.?</p>
<p>According to House, ?This has not deterred my family from keeping the business growing. In fact, it has become the rallying cry to build it bigger.?</p>
<p>He adds, ?We just added our first full fiber service customer and are starting a project to bring ?Fiber to the Home? for an isolated community of 150 homes. We are also going to be ?resellers/wholesalers? for a local cooperative phone company that is bringing in WiMax. This will make a great addition to the services we already provide.?</p>

<article id="0000575" published-at="2008-12-10" title="Stop Sobbing About Free Music Downloads"><p>My name is JACK ELY and I?m the one whose voice is heard daily on The Kingsmen?s 1963 recording of Louie Louie, (may it rest in peace) so you know I have some music business experience.</p>
<p>First I?d like to express an opinion that probably will not be very popular but which oozes with truth. In the early ?60?s when I was recording, records were thought of as a tool to help promote live performances. The live performances were the main revenue stream and the records were just promotional tools to get people to come see the shows. Somewhere this mode of thinking got turned upside down. Consequently in years hence, record companies, producers, et. all, have made recordings, hoping to profit from the sale of those recordings alone, regardless of whether or not the artist could ever pull it off live. This did some things to the music business that weren?t very healthy. First it made available to the general public, music of artists who may or may not be good live performers; almost anyone can make a good recording with enough cut-ins and loops. And? it made music by groups of players who never ever intended to perform that music live, and who may or may not have ever been able to get along with each other long enough to really sustain any kind of a road show.</p>
<p>Music is meant to be played for the enjoyment of the audiences. For instance, if I go into the studio with an acoustic guitar and simultaneously play and sing on a recording, people would come to see me perform in that same mode; I.e. playing guitar and singing as a solo act. I don?t think they would come to see me expecting a full band. Conversely, if I advertised a ?Night with Louie Louie? people would come expecting to see a rock band that they could dance to, and would be quite disappointed if I showed up with just my acoustic guitar.</p>
<p>The suggestions that recordings are produced today just to sell recorded music is all backwards and the sooner the record companies and producers and artists figure this out the sooner they will all quit sniveling over the fact that the entire world is freely sharing their music digitally and isn?t willing to stop; and in fact will do anything to circumvent their efforts to get paid for the recordings alone.</p>
<p>The days of producers and musicians putting bands together just to get a recording deal so they can get paid by the record company for a product that usually never even gets released; those days are over. It?s time record companies went back to their roots and became what they started out to be; entities who record working acts in order to</p>
<p>1) capture the performance for posterity, and</p>
<p>2) make a promotional tool to get audiences to the next show.</p>
<p>The solution is to give the world all the free music it wants, but to give the recording entity, whether it be a record company or a producer, or whomever, a cut of every live performance. That will do at least two things and maybe more that I haven?t even thought about yet. First it will give everyone involved in the recordings a source of revenue (pay day) for all their hard work of producing and promoting the recordings. Second, it will weed out all the so-called ?recording artists? who couldn?t, in a live venue, perform their way out of a paper bag. In a down economy the public craves live entertainment, so what better time to get back to basics. The timing couldn?t be better for a profitable turn around. So now is the time to get it going.</p>
<p>I send you these thoughts in hopes that just maybe a new/old perspective on the subject of recorded music can be presented to the entire recording world and they can all start making a real profit.</p>

<article id="0000577" title="Baptist youth inspire giving to Africa, India water projects"><p>By Ken Camp</p>
<p>One high school student?s dream prompted a church to raise more than $94,000 for a ministry that provides clean water sources to people in developing nations.</p>
<p>About five years ago, Katie Honeycutt, a sophomore in the youth group at&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.sugarlandbaptist.org/" type="external">Sugar Land Baptist Church</a>, fell asleep in the car on a family road trip. She dreamed about her Houston-area youth group holding fundraising events for&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.water.cc/" type="external">Living Water International</a>, an organization she had heard about at school.</p>
<p>When she awoke, she described the dream to her mother, who encouraged her to tell Debi Foley, associate pastor to students at Sugar Land Baptist.</p>
<p>?She came to me with a folder filed with information about Living Water International,? Foley recalled.</p>
<p>The faith-based nonprofit organization in nearby Stafford, Texas, exists ?to demonstrate the love of God by helping communities acquire desperately needed clean water and experience ?Living Water? ? the gospel of Jesus Christ ? which alone satisfies the deepest thirst,? according to its mission statement. Living Water?s board of directors includes Mark Hartman, pastor of&amp;#160; <a href="http://sugarcreek.net/" type="external">Sugar Creek Baptist Church</a>&amp;#160;in Sugar Land, and Chris Seay, pastor of&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.ecclesiahouston.org/" type="external">Ecclesia Church</a>&amp;#160;in Houston.</p>
<p>?Living Water International not only builds wells across the globe to help bring clean drinking water, but they also do hygiene classes with the community and train individuals in each location in well-maintenance,? Foley said.</p>
<p>The ministry grew out of a 1990 mission trip to Kenya involving about three-dozen volunteers from Sugar Creek Baptist Church. It began by teaching Kenyans in the Mombasa area how to drill a water well, and it grew into a ministry that has resulted in 12,797 completed water projects in 23 countries, mostly in Africa, South Asia and Latin America.</p>
<p>Honeycutt presented a plan to Foley, complete with ideas about how to involve the church?s youth group in various events to raise money for the ministry and raise awareness about the need for clean water in developing nations.</p>
<p>?I told her, ?If you have the plan and the vision, I am in full support,?? Foley recalled.</p>
<p>The student group washed cars and donated all the proceeds to Living Water International.</p>
<p>Another initiative involved Project H2O, in which church members were challenged to drink nothing but water for two weeks and donate any money they would have spent on beverages to Living Water.</p>
<p>?It has made our church aware of the number of people around the globe who don?t have access to something that we often take for granted,? Foley said.</p>
<p>The youth group also organized an annual churchwide dessert auction. The students provide entertainment and church members bid on donated baked goods. Proceeds are designated for well-drilling projects.</p>
<p>?The dessert auction raised $13,000 in one night early on, and we raised $22,000 in one night last year,? Foley recalled.</p>
<p>In five years, the youth group has inspired Sugar Land Baptist Church to donate $94,817 to build and maintain 12 wells in Africa and India.</p>
<p>?What started as a dream has become a reality for 12 different communities, including a school in Uganda,? Foley said. ?In those 12 locations, there is now access to clean drinking water, information about proper hygiene and the knowledge of the Living Water of Jesus Christ.?</p>
<p>Sugar Land Baptist Pastor Phil Lineberger praised the students? commitment to alleviating human suffering.</p>
<p>?It speaks volumes about their priorities and their sensitivity to the most pressing needs of our world. That cup of water given in Jesus? name is ministry extended to Jesus himself,? he said.</p>
<p>Honeycutt, a graphic design major at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, has returned home to Sugar Land Baptist Church for every dessert auction.</p>
<p>?It was never about me or something I had to lead ? it always was something we could do together as a youth group,? she said.</p>

<article id="0000578" published-at="2017-09-07" title="Australia developing wearable 'Fight Recorder' for soldiers"><p>Sept. 7 (UPI) ? Australia is developing a data recorder to be worn by soldiers on the battlefield, Minister for Defense Industry Christopher Pyne said Thursday.</p>
<p>The ?Fight Recorder? ? akin to the so-called black box used on aircraft ? would act as an emergency beacon to reduce the time taken to reach and treat battlefield casualties.</p>
<p>?In addition to serving as a location beacon, the data captured by the Fight Recorder could be used to inform the design and performance of soldier equipment and protective wear,? Pyne <a href="https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/news/2017/09/07/black-box-soldiers-capture-crucial-data-battlefield" type="external">said in a press release</a>.</p>
<p>Australian telecommunications company Myriota and wearable technology company IMeasureU, will conduct the system development with about $559,000 of funding from the government?s Next Generation Technologies Fund.</p>
<p>?Defense will work closely with these companies to help deliver this world-first innovation,? Pyne said.</p>
<p>The minister said that when fully developed the recorder could also be used by emergency services and law enforcement personnel.</p></article>
<article id="0000580" title="Churches respond to call for disaster relief in Augusta, Ga."><p>By Jeff Brumley</p>
<p>Andy Jones says he has just one answer for church groups still looking for that quick spring or early summer mission: come to Augusta, Ga.</p>
<p>As the minister of missions at <a href="http://www.fbcaugusta.org/" type="external">First Baptist Church</a> there, Jones has been overseeing the recovery and cleanup work in the month since <a href="http://www.weather.com/news/winter/storms/2013/pax" type="external">a winter ice storm</a> blew through the Southeast.</p>
<p>In Augusta and the surrounding area, the mid-February storm left fallen trees, damaged homes and hundreds without power for up to two weeks.</p>
<p>A First Baptist volunteer force got to work the day after Winter Storm Pax departed the area.</p>
<p>?We have been going at this since the Friday after the storm,? Jones told ABPnews/Herald. ?We attacked the structural things first ?&amp;#160;limbs on houses, patching holes in ceilings, putting tarps on roofs.?</p>
<p>But there is still a lot to do. Two other disaster-relief organizations recently left Augusta, bequeathing nearly 100 names of residents still in need of help. That?s on top of a list of 30 the church still has yet to get to, Jones said.</p>
<p>With a volunteer force of around 55 from the congregation, that means a lot of outside help is needed mostly for debris removal and clearing limbs from yards in a two-county area.</p>
<p>Two Cooperative Baptist Fellowship groups ?&amp;#160;one from South Carolina, another from Georgia ?&amp;#160;recently visited to help. But more are needed.</p>
<p>?If I could get some more groups like that, I could get this thing knocked out and done,? he said.</p>
<p>Tommy Deal, CBF national disaster response coordinator, issued a call for help on the Fellowship?s disaster Facebook page Monday. He is headed to Augusta on Sunday.</p>
<p>?I?m just going to encourage them and thank them,? Deal said.</p>
<p>Churches and individuals interested in helping may contact Jones by email at <a href="mailto:ajones@fbcaugusta.org" type="external">ajones@fbcaugusta.org</a>, or by calling him at 706.306.3015.</p></article>

<article id="0000582" title="A tale of two Chucks"><p>What a couple of agnostics taught me about congregational business.</p>
<p>I have two friends who are particularly dear to me, both named Chuck. I first met The Chucks, as I call them, a few years ago in a writers? group at Eagle Eye Bookstore here in Decatur. The group eventually got so large that the three of us peeled off to form a smaller circle, and for the better part of the next year we spent two hours every Monday afternoon reading aloud our works-in-progress and exchanging feedback and support. Chuck One worked in computers until he retired and is now penning a sci-fi thriller.&amp;#160; Chuck Two used to be an architect and is halfway through a memoir about the years he spent as a boy in the company of Robert Frost.</p>
<p>Both are brilliant, hilarious and happily agnostic. ?So this is where the abracadabra happens!? Chuck One said with a mixture of sarcasm and awe the first time I showed him our sanctuary. Quickly dubbing me their authority on all things religious, each week they dropped some new question at my feet, like a cat presents a prize mouse on the doorstep after a night?s hunt. No question was too lofty or absurd: Why did God allow the Crusades? Do TV preachers all use the same hair stylist? What does God do if Hitler converts just as the cyanide is kicking in?</p>
<p>Whenever the three of us met, in addition to our writing we also caught each other up on our families, our histories and whatever else was on our minds. We opened up to each other. We took risks with each other. In short, we became friends.</p>
<p>As it happened, during the entire time that The Chucks and I were meeting, our church was going through the kind of turmoil, anxiety and conflict that comes whenever a congregation grapples with a particularly difficult challenge. Our own conundrum had largely to do with the economic realities facing nearly every faith community in 21st century America. It was perhaps the hardest, most painful time I?d known in twenty-five years of ministry.</p>
<p>It wasn?t hard for The Chucks to see that I was exhausted, stressed and semi-depressed. One Monday as we were getting settled, they put their manuscripts aside and said, ?Look, kiddo, you?ve got to tell us what?s going on. You?re a wreck. What gives??&amp;#160;I was caught off guard. I had never mentioned the situation to them. But they persisted, so for the next few minutes I did my best to describe it:</p>
<p>Well, see, we?re financially out of balance and, well . . . our deacons and personnel committee have called a congregational meeting and, um . . . our bylaws require that we, um, well . . . there?ll be a vote and, uh . . . we?re bringing in a professional parliamentarian and, well . . . it?s all really painful for our staff and congregation, and people are upset and some are leaving and, well . . .</p>
<p>I stopped. I could see from their earnest faces that they were totally there for me. They were leaning forward and nodding supportively like friends do. I looked at them looking at me.&amp;#160;And then I understood.</p>
<p>This issue?over which our congregation had prayed, wept, agonized, cited Scripture, fretted, battled, held dozens of meetings and devoted hundreds of committee hours?was such an exclusively internal concern, it had about as much chance of encouraging my two agnostic friends toward God as a monster truck rally or the latest episode of Spongebob.</p>
<p>Eighteen months later I still find myself thinking about that afternoon. If your church happens to be on a steep path like the one we?ve been walking, I want to offer three encouragements:</p>
<p>1.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; The fact that an internal problem doesn?t translate easily to unchurched lives does not mean it?s unimportant.&amp;#160; If the wheels are coming off the wagon, you?ve got to pull off the road and deal with it. In our own congregation the issue affected the livelihoods of beloved staff, not to mention the emotional and spiritual health of the congregation?you bet it was important. Some matters simply have to be addressed, even if they mystify the people&amp;#160;we?re most wanting to befriend.</p>
<p>2.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; As you face the institutionally urgent, keep in mind the infinitely significant.&amp;#160; In the end, it?s not about solving a problem in order to survive another day. It?s not about right-sizing the budget, or protecting staff, or releasing staff, or keeping big givers happy, or preserving our heritage. Ultimately, it?s about people who are at this moment at the gym, the corner pub, the city jail, the corporate dining room, the community garden, the immigration office, the Rotary Club or anywhere but these churches of ours.</p>
<p>3.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Spend yourself for something big.&amp;#160; When we find ourselves investing as much prayer and passion and intellect and committee energy and congregational wattage trying to befriend our estranged-from-God neighbors as we devote to all of our internal affairs?we will have taken a really promising step.</p>
<p>In the end, it?s about The Chucks.</p></article>
<article id="0000583" published-at="2016-10-19" title="Watch As Texas Clerk Shoots Armed Robber While Never Dropping His Cigarette"><p>The Smoke Alley Store in Houston, Texas takes their safety and their smokes seriously.</p>
<p>Case in point, the security-cam footage below, showing a thug wearing a backpack and a hat entering the store pretending to be a customer?then suddenly drawing his gun on the employee behind the counter.</p>
<p>The clerk, named Raleigh, puts his cigarette in his mouth and quickly pulls his own pistol, while moving behind a support beam next to the register to use as cover. Raleigh then fires multiple shots at the criminal, and the two exchange gunfire.</p>
<p>His robbery attempt thwarted, the thug turns and runs straight through the store's glass door, spilling onto the hard pavement outside.</p>
<p>Raleigh told the <a href="http://controversialtimes.com/news/gun-toting-thug-learns-why-you-dont-mess-with-texas-store-employees-video/" type="external">Controversial Times</a> about about the harrowing ordeal.</p>
<p>?We have one of those door chimes so I heard the door ding but by the time I looked up, he already had his gun pointed at me and said ?Hands up, n***a'?</p>
<p>?I saw the barrel of the gun, I saw him, and I took cover behind that small bit of wood we have in the store so I could draw my firearm, a CZ-75 SP-01 Tactical, and start firing.?</p>
<p>?The first shot I popped off was low in his general direction and it scared him and got him moving. Then I came around the corner and started firing.?</p>
<p>As almost every viewer has noted, Raleigh never dropped the Nat Sherman Classic Blue cigarette he was holding while defending himself and the store.</p>
<p>Knowing that he was just about 50 feet from Westheimer Rd, a major traffic thoroughfare in Houston, Raleigh said he tried to keep his shots low as the thug fled from the store, tumbling to the ground as he caught a round in the shoulder when stepping off the curb.</p>
<p>?I called the cops, told them I discharged a firearm in the city of Houston, that it was an armed robbery and they came out.?</p>
<p>The suspect was reportedly found in the hospital, but detectives have only stated that it remains an open investigation.</p>

<article id="0000589" published-at="2016-10-21" title="The Russians Have Been Hacking Us For Years, Why Is It a Crisis Now?"><p>The would-be incoming presidential administration insists that they should not be held responsible for their security failures in the wake of Russian hacks??a standard radically removed from the one applied to other powerful organizations, in previous hacks of very similar nature.</p>
<p>In fact, the DNC and the Clinton campaign have been portrayed in the media as bearing far&amp;#160;less&amp;#160;responsibility than either Target or Home Depot did when both were hacked by Russian groups.</p>
<p>Daily exhortations by TV pundits,&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">the White House</a>,&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">Department of Homeland Security</a>, and the Hillary Clinton campaign instruct viewers that these latest hacks targeting campaign chairman John Podesta, and before that the DNC, should be considered acts of Russian aggression meriting an official, even&amp;#160;&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">military response</a>. Indeed, media has already trumpeted a ?covert? (because Russians don?t have TV of course)&amp;#160; <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fnews%2Fus-news%2Fcia-prepping-possible-cyber-strike-against-russia-n666636" type="external">CIA-led cyberattack</a>&amp;#160;in retaliation for these Democratic Party breaches.</p>
<p>The question arises: were these latest Russian attacks on American organizations unique? Were they of such a dangerous new nature as to warrant a public escalation of confrontational rhetoric, to the point of increasing the likelihood of&amp;#160; <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ianwelsh.net%2Frussia-is-preparing-for-war%2F" type="external">war between nuclear powers</a>?</p>
<p>Far from it. Russian groups were behind the 2013&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">Target</a>&amp;#160;and 2014&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">Home Depot&amp;#160;</a>hacks, both of which involved sophisticated attacks breaching their security and compromising record-setting amounts of sensitive data. For being the victims of these hacks, the companies themselves took the brunt of blame in the media. Bloomberg was unsparing in its treatment of Target: they ?blew it,? read the headline:</p>
<p>By virtue of doing business, these companies are, by default,&amp;#160;expected&amp;#160;to safeguard the financial information of their customers. It is incumbent upon&amp;#160;them&amp;#160;to secure their databases from hacking attempts, and take their lumps from customers and media when they fail to do so???then improve their security to prevent it from happening again in the future.</p>
<p>Imagine for a moment, in the context of the 2016 election season, that Bloomberg ran an article doling out culpability in an equivalent fashion:</p>
<p>Missed Alarms and <a href="" type="internal">&amp;#160;Thousands of Stolen Donor Credit Cards</a>: How the DNC Blew It.</p>
<p>This headline is virtually inconceivable in the current political landscape.</p>
<p>When&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">Home Depot</a>&amp;#160;was hacked by Russians in 2014?? compromising some 40 million customers? credit card data and home addresses??&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">lawmakers demanded</a>&amp;#160;that the company explain what failings ?permitted unauthorized access? to the sensitive information:</p>
<p>Federal lawmakers have begun probing how Home Depot was breached. Senators?sent the company a letter today requesting a briefing.</p>
<p>?We ask that Home Depot?s information-security officials provide a briefing to committee staff regarding your company?s investigation and latest findings on the circumstances that may have permitted unauthorized access to sensitive customer information,? the senators wrote in the letter to Francis Blake, Home Depot?s chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Notably absent is any mention of either Russian hackers or Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>In past cases where crime syndicates tied to the Russian government successfully breached a US company?s database, as in the case of a 2014&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">JP Morgan hack</a>, the media still placed the onus on the hacked institution to explain its failure to secure its databases. Why? Because ?companies of our size unfortunately experience cyber attacks nearly every day,? said JPMorgan spokeswoman, quoted in Bloomberg. Cyberthreats are taken as a fact of life in the modern digital world, and accountability lies with the powerful institutions to protect themselves from the inevitable attempts at intrusion. It is&amp;#160;expected&amp;#160;that large, high-profile organizations with valuable databases will be targets for hackers.</p>
<p>In the case of the 2015 Anthem hack, the health insurer ?was the target of a very sophisticated external&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">cyberattack</a>? that compromised ?names, birthdays, Social Security numbers, addresses and employment data? of as many as 80 million customers: an identity theft goldmine. Media commentary again held Anthem and its industry accountable: ?The breach is a wake-up call to the health industry, experts say,? wrote USA Today.</p>
<p>The 2015 Office of Personnel Management hack was, as&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">Washington Post describes</a>, ?one of the most devastating breaches of U.S. government data in history,? carried out by Chinese hackers. In response to this hack, which was indeed unprecedented, the US government soberly announced it would&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">withdraw personnel from China</a>&amp;#160;for their own protection. We did not see the White House or the intelligence community publicly weave a plot of aggression on the part of the Chinese state, or build a confrontational and Sinophobic fervor among the American people, as the Clinton camp and media are doing now with Russia. It goes without saying that Xi Jinping has dismal name recognition among Americans, in comparison to bogeyman Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>In none of these instances did the news media parade out FBI or other intelligence agency findings for the purpose of stoking fear or distrust of the hackers? home country, nor did they trot out official declarations to retaliate against the originating nation. Rather, the media convention in the previous Russian hacks was to hold the companies&amp;#160;who were hacked&amp;#160;accountable for their own failure to safeguard the sensitive information they held.</p>
<p>Yet here we are in the 2016 election where the most powerful political machine in modern US history, the likely soon-to-be Clinton Administration, is being held to a lower standard of accountability for its security practices than Target and Home Depot stores. The Clinton team will be expected to manage the safeguarding of information pertaining to the national security interests of the United States. But in a striking departure from all prior reporting conventions on major Russian and Chinese hacks alike, the DNC and Clinton Campaign are portrayed as victims who bear no public accountability for their security failings.</p>
<p>Top Clinton policy aide Neera Tanden, currently the President and CEO of think tank Center for American Progress (and likely future White House Chief-of-Staff) recently took to Twitter to justify the confrontational anti-Russian posturing in terms that would equally apply to both the Target and Home Depot hacks: ? <a href="https://twitter.com/TyHealey" type="external">@TyHealey</a>&amp;#160;no one wants war with Russia, but if they sent military over here to steal property, would you see US as aggressor or them??</p>
<p>In no uncertain terms, Russian hackers stole massive volumes of valuable data from both companies, and in fact posted the compromised credit card data for sale online on the dark web, the internet?s criminal underbelly. If Tanden believes the Democratic party hacks meet the standard set out in this tweet, so must the Target and Home Depot hacks.</p>
<p>But the DNC, the Clinton campaign, and their allies in the current administration as well as the media have turned just this particular Russian hack into an international confrontation with another nuclear power, where no previous Russian (or Chinese) hack of comparable (or greater!) criminality elicited such a response.</p>
<p>The DNC and Clinton campaign naturally wants to distract from the fact that they failed to safeguard their donors? and their own sensitive information. After all, their team will assume control of the most powerful executive branch on earth and understandably, do not want the public to doubt their competence in handling information regarding national security???any more than they already do, given Clinton?s long-running email server scandal (key phrase:&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">?extremely careles</a>s?).</p>
<p>The mainstream media is now in the extraordinary position of demanding&amp;#160;less&amp;#160;accountability from the Clinton team, as well the DNC, than it demanded of Target and Home Depot retail chains.</p>
<p>Of course, the Clinton campaign rejoinder is that WikiLeaks is working to alter the outcome of the November election??while simultaneously claiming that nothing ?earth shattering? or ?shocking? is being revealed. Publishing the inner workings and deliberations of the campaign, while perhaps embarrassing, can only truly threaten to alter the election outcome if something highly damaging is revealed, such as proof of a cover up of criminal intent in the email server saga, or something illegal about the intermingled operations of the State Department and the Clinton Foundation while Hillary was Secretary of State.</p>
<p>If the Clinton campaign?s alarms of election-altering intent on the part of WikiLeaks is credible, then the aggressive anti-Russian posturing must be taken as a signal that truly damaging evidence is yet to be released.</p>
<p>If nothing so consequential is in store, we are forced to consider the disturbing possibility that fomenting escalated conflict and maybe even direct war with Russia may itself be a foreign policy aim of an incoming Clinton administration. This is an extreme scenario, but a foreseeable one given the fact that a&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">no-fly zone in Syria</a>&amp;#160;(which Clinton has&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">repeatedly endorsed</a>) entails war with Russia. This is in addition to the reported aims of the cyberattack, which are ?harassing? and ?embarrassing? Russian leadership, when&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">Putin is already paranoid</a>&amp;#160;about Clinton?s penchant for regime change.</p>
<p>Elements of both is certainly a possible explanation; which is to say, escalated conflict with Russia may serve as a very cynical and destructive distraction from criminal revelations yet to be published through WikiLeaks. A two-birds-with-one-stone strategy, as it were.</p>
<p>In June, when news initially broke of the DNC and&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">Clinton Foundation hacks</a>, Democrats explained that the Red Scare narrative would in fact be their deflection strategy:</p>
<p>If the Democrats can show the hidden hand of Russian intelligence agencies, they believe that voter outrage will probably outweigh any embarrassing revelations, a person familiar with the party?s thinking said.</p>
<p>The Democrats have by now gone much further than showing a Russian hand in the hacks. The record shows that such public militating against Russia (or China for that matter) has no precedent as a response to a comparable hack, theft, and publication of private US information.</p>
<p>One must wonder whether these extraordinary and potentially dangerous escalations are designed either to distract from more than just ?embarrassing revelations???or to set the stage for a ramp-up in US anti-Russian aggression.</p>

<article id="0000017" published-at="2004-07-29" title="SAN FRANCISCO / Head of Juvenile Probation Department under fire / Gas leaks, criticism over reform progress may doom Tucker"><p>Chief juvenile probation officer <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Gwendolyn+Tucker%22" type="external">Gwendolyn Tucker</a>, in charge of the city department that incarcerates and attempts to rehabilitate thousands of children accused of committing crimes, is facing a flood of criticism from youth advocates, her staff and <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Juvenile+Probation+Commission%22" type="external">juvenile probation commission</a>ers who are considering whether to fire her.</p>
<p>The Juvenile Probation Commission held an emergency meeting Monday that lasted long into the night and is reconvening again today to discuss Tucker's fate.</p>
<p>Tucker, who was promoted from assistant chief last summer after then- chief <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Jesse+Williams%22" type="external">Jesse Williams</a> quit, has been accused of ignoring gas leaks and fire hazards at Log Cabin Ranch for boys, not working hard enough to send youths to community rehabilitation programs rather than the juvenile hall lockup, and clashing with her staff.</p>
<p>Tucker has not publicly answered her accusers and referred all questions, including those about past or present gas leaks and other operational issues, to her private attorney, <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Gregg+Adam%22" type="external">Gregg Adam</a>. Adam said Tucker will meet behind closed doors with commissioners sometime during today's meeting.</p>
<p>"She will respond to the commission," Adam said. "It's not appropriate for her to respond publicly."</p>
<p>The possible shakeup at the <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Juvenile+Probation+Department%22" type="external">Juvenile Probation Department</a> is just one more controversy for a department that has struggled with what youth advocates say is one of the highest incarceration rates in the state. There have been two major reform efforts since 1996 to reduce the number of minors in lockup by sending low-risk offenders into community programs. But watchdogs have said both efforts have made little impact.</p>
<p>"It takes dedicated, willful leadership, the kind of leadership we might have to find outside of San Francisco," said <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Andrea+Shorter%22" type="external">Andrea Shorter</a>, deputy executive director of the <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Center+on+Juvenile%22" type="external">Center on Juvenile</a> and Criminal Justice, a think tank and lobbying group that advocates rehabilitation programs rather than incarceration.</p>
<p>About a year ago, the Juvenile Probation Department adopted a new intake questionnaire meant to help probation officers determine whether recently arrested children should be locked up while awaiting their court date or released to a community program. Kids are graded according to the severity of their alleged crime, history and flight risk.</p>
<p><a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Ntanya+Lee%22" type="external">Ntanya Lee</a> of Coleman Advocates for Children and Youth said 93 percent of arrested juveniles were incarcerated when the new intake procedure was adopted. A year later, she said, kids who are considered low risk are still being locked up because probation officers are ignoring the new system.</p>
<p>Lee said Mayor <a href="" type="internal">Gavin Newsom</a> made a campaign promise to appoint a new chief, and she is still waiting. The mayor has been slowly replacing department heads since he took office seven months ago.</p>
<p>The Juvenile Probation Commission might move ahead without him.</p>
<p>At Monday's commission meeting, Lee joined other watchdogs and employees who testified about Tucker's job performance. Tucker's supporters included her director of special programs for youth, who declined to be interviewed later.</p>
<p>Mercedes Hernandez-Bran, the department's human resources director, told the commission that since December she has tried to alert Tucker and her staff about gas leaks and fires in the kitchen and laundry room at Log Cabin Ranch, a residential program in La Honda. But Hernandez-Bran alleged that her warnings were pushed aside.</p>
<p>Longtime cook <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Jeff+Hatton%22" type="external">Jeff Hatton</a>, who didn't attend the meeting, told The Chronicle that he always smells gas and that there was a leak last week that resulted in a small fire.</p>
<p>La Honda volunteer fire Chief <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Larry+Whitney%22" type="external">Larry Whitney</a> said his crew has responded to about six calls from the ranch since November, and one incident included a gas leak in the administration building. He said that although there have been a few more calls than usual, none of the incidents was significant.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tucker and her attorney are awaiting the commission's next move. Adam said he will argue that labor laws for peace officers afford her the right to appeal a dismissal, if that's what is coming.</p></article>
<article id="0000019" published-at="2017-10-05" title="Nancy Pelosi Lies On CNN About Gun Control, Angry Marine Teaches Her Brutal Lesson"><p>CNN recently hosted a propaganda town hall event on ?gun control? featuring Nancy Pelosi. The show was scripted down to the participants, who were all leftists, and it was a perfect echo chamber. However, one retired Marine Captain, who also owns a gun store, somehow got by the screeners. He posed a question to Pelosi, and right away, she started to lie. That didn?t stop this Marine, who refused to be cut off, even when they turned the lights off on him, and he delivered a lesson for Pelosi and all the other anti-gun liberals echoing her narrative.</p>
<p>CNN, the network that is losing&amp;#160;its viewership rapidly, hosted a gun control propaganda ?town hall.? There was nothing spontaneous or unscripted at all. Town halls usually are not scripted, and the audience asks questions that are not supposed&amp;#160;to be known. However, this is CNN and Nancy Pelosi. Until retired Marine&amp;#160;Captain Dan Hinkson is called on, the House Minority Leader sailed through the questions, even lying to a distraught&amp;#160;family, who had lost a loved one in Las Vegas, saying, ?I will not rest until we have done something to make this stop. ?</p>
<p>Pelosi was aware that the Marine Captain is a gun store owner, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wg9TY_KuwVE" type="external">so he asked her,</a> ?With someone [Stephen Paddock] like that, with that motivation, what new law could we put out there that would stop something like this??&amp;#160;The Marine?s attitude is very stern, and for him and most Americans, this is a rhetorical&amp;#160;question. He knows there is no law that would have stopped this, but that goes over Pelosi?s head, as most things do these days.</p>
<p>Pelosi?s brilliant answer: ?Background checks.? What? We all know there are already background checks, which Stephen Paddock passed, so she went on, ?We need to have background checks and violent prevention background checks, and make them effective.? That?s her big solution, and the CNN host, Chris Cuomo, a gun control nutjob himself, was moving onto the next question, but Captain Hinkson wasn?t done.</p>
<p>They put the Captain back in his seat, in the dark, as Nancy droned on about background checks. They show his face for one second, and he is clearly pissed off. Finally, he shouts out, ?They have background checks,? to which Pelosi responds by parroting him, ?They have background checks.? It?s like watching the three stooges minus one, and Pelosi and Cuomo are clearly the two stooges on stage.</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://twitchy.com/gregp-3534/2017/10/05/this-retired-marine-captain-and-gun-store-owner-asked-nancy-pelosi-a-simple-question-her-answer-says-it-all/" type="external">Twitchy</a> reported, ?During a town hall on CNN last night, Nancy Pelosi erroneously claimed that legislation on expanded background checks for gun purchases would have somehow stopped the Las Vegas massacre,? and&amp;#160; Americans weighed in on the Pelosi&amp;#160;shenanigans. The comments are brutal:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Every state has background checks. Colorado has enhanced ones. Nancy is a clueless politician when it comes to gun laws.</p>
<p>? Cofemale? (@GrandmaWarrior) <a href="https://twitter.com/GrandmaWarrior/status/915779756926349312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" type="external">October 5, 2017</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Pelosi also brought up ?gun show loopholes.? This is a favorite of the anti-Second Amendment&amp;#160;crowd. It also is bogus. There are major obstacles to the gun show loophole that these lawmakers ignore to push their propaganda.</p>
<p>?[M]ost inventory ? new and used ? is in the hands of licensed dealers, and licensed dealers have to run a background check every time they sell a gun. Furthermore, most people are not going to risk their livelihood on the chance of making a few dollars in a dingy convention hall when following the rules results in the same profits and only takes a few more minutes,? reports <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2016/10/22/ccw-weekend-the-myth-of-the-gun-show-loophole/" type="external">The Daily Caller</a>, adding, ?they cannot sell a gun to anyone, under any circumstances, without conducting [a background check].?</p>
<p>The Democrats are playing the anti-gun game again, and we have seen the crazed responses from the Hollywood crowd. We have gun control, we have background checks, we have done as much as we can without crossing over into taking away our rights. It doesn?t save lives, anyway. We all know that, and so do they. They just want to take away all guns because somehow they think that will fix all the evil in the world.</p>
<p>Here?s what we know: people who truly have faith in God also seem to be staunch supporters of our Second Amendment rights, it seems to go hand in hand. It?s simple, we know what the Pelosis and the Jimmy Kimmels can?t grasp: the guns aren?t causing the evil in this world.</p></article>
<article id="0000023" published-at="2017-04-20" title="University leaders ban pro-life flag display, say it ?created an unsafe environment?"><p>Pro-life students at Wilfrid Laurier University say they will no longer be able to put up their pro-life flag display, with campus leaders explaining such exhibits are too traumatic after one last fall caused an uproar on the Canadian campus.</p>
<p>The display used 10,000 pink and blue flags to represent the 100,000 abortions each year in Canada.</p>
<p>Student Union President Tyler Van Herzele, in a <a href="http://yourstudentsunion.ca/a-letter-from-the-president/" type="external">letter</a> shared campuswide, stated that ?the visceral nature of the display interfered with the ability of some members of the Laurier community to safely attend class, travel to work or remain on campus to study.?</p>
<p>?The adversarial tone of the event evoked a confrontation which eliminated the possibility of respectful dialogue and created an unsafe environment for all students.?</p>
<p>According to his December 2016 letter, several offices, including the Diversity and Equity Office, have worked together ?to ensure this does not happen again.?</p>
<p></p>
<p>In an email to The College Fix this month, campus spokesman Kevin Crowley echoed such sentiments. He noted the university ?firmly upholds the principles of free speech and strives to provide an environment that protects the right of all people to engage in critical and respectful dialogue.? But, he added, ?we must, however, balance the exercise of free speech with the need to support individuals who may have experienced harm related to a specific topic being discussed.?</p>
<p>The display in question was a project of the school?s LifeLink group. It was set up in October on the quad, with approval from the student union.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Christine Schuknecht, a student at the university?s Waterloo campus and a member of LifeLink, wrote for <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/christine-schuknecht-at-wilfrid-laurier-university-do-as-the-campus-thought-police-dictate-or-else" type="external">National Post</a> about what led to such a display being banned.</p>
<p>After the flags had been up for several hours, students and university employees took action against it, according to Schuknect.</p>
<p>The Diversity and Equity Office placed a sign by the display reading ?Warning: Anti-Choice display ahead.? Special Constable Services were called after students vandalized flags and the club banner and yelled at LifeLink members. The constables did not see any issue with the display and commended members, she wrote.</p>
<p>Schuknect explains she was ?dumbfounded.? The Diversity and Equity Office, she wrote, was supposed to be ?non-partisan,? but had used ?anti-choice? to describe her club.</p>
<p>?The DEO hangs posters across my campus insisting that students use ?proper terms? when addressing the groups it explicitly supports, but went out of its way to apply a negatively torqued label to ours,? Schuknect wrote.</p>
<p>Jonah Vanleeuwen, the group?s vice-president, echoed sentiments of surprise and disappointment.</p>
<p>?I was very disappointed to see that despite our efforts to stay peaceful and reserved, the group using violent tactics was being raised on a pedestal,? he said in an email to The College Fix.</p>
<p>Students spoke out about the display in other ways. The Cord, the campus newspaper, <a href="https://thecord.ca/anti-choice-demonstration-in-the-quad/" type="external">published</a> ?Anti-abortion demonstration in the Quad,? which wrote those at the university ?were surprised? to see the flags. The article included statements from Daniel Quintia, a third-year student who admitted to pulling out some of the flags, saying he was ?just frankly kind of pissed.?</p>
<p>The Diversity and Equity Office referred The College Fix to the Student Union when emailed for comment. Van Herzele failed to respond to emails or phone calls from The Fix.</p>

<p>What do oil and wine have in common? <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2011/wp1101.pdf" type="external">A new working paper</a> from two IMF economists, which is generating a <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8dad38fa-1ced-11e0-8c86-00144feab49a.html" type="external">lot</a> <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/source/2011/01/05/why-opec-doesnt-deserve-sour-grapes/" type="external">of</a> <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/source/2011/01/05/why-opec-doesnt-deserve-sour-grapes/" type="external">buzz</a>, argues that they?re a lot more alike than you?d imagine. (Hat tip: <a href="http://oilandglory.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/01/14/is_investing_in_both_fine_wine_and_crude_oil_a_good_idea" type="external">Steve LeVine</a>.) The authors look at the prices of crude oil and fine wine between 1998 and 2010 and show that they?re highly correlated. They find that that?s because they?re both driven primarily by demand ? in particular, they argue that surging global economic growth over the period they?ve studied explains a huge fraction of the movement in both wine and oil prices. Supply constraints, on the other hand, seem to play at most a bit role.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>That?s provoked a reaction <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/source/2011/01/05/why-opec-doesnt-deserve-sour-grapes/" type="external">over at the Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>
<p>?The working paper buries the long-held view that OPEC can move prices up and down solely by turning spigots on and off. Dead are the days of the oil shocks of the 1970s when blockades and revolutions threw wealthy economies into disarray. Long live the demand shocks where price hikes are mainly driven by the roaring engine of fast-industrializing nations.?</p>
<p>Not so fast. There are two big problems with this argument. Thinking through them helps us understand a bit about how OPEC and oil markets might work.</p>
<p>First, while I have no doubt that OPEC is often far less influential than many assume, the study mashes together several periods in a way that makes it very difficult to draw conclusions about the impact of supply on prices. It?s quite possible to argue that a supply glut made OPEC relatively powerless in the late 1990s; OPEC then became quite influential (in keeping prices up) for a few years at the beginning of the 2000s; then OPEC lost control (while trying to hold prices down) through the later part of the spike; and, finally, OPEC started exerting upward pressure on prices again in the last couple years of the decade. (When I say ?OPEC?, I don?t mean to imply that the group necessarily functions effectively as a cartel; Saudi market power means that OPEC can often influence prices without effective collusion.) The impact of this type of inconsistent behavior may be difficult to detect using the approach in the paper.</p>
<p>Second, the wine analogy is severely flawed. Here?s the Journal again:</p>
<p>?[The authors] reached their conclusion after finding that fine wine prices?measured in an index of 24 Bordeaux chateaux?moved alongside crude oil in the past decade. Unlike OPEC for oil, no international producers? group of stature exists for fine red.?</p>
<p>Here?s the thing: Oil supply should be responsive to price. The supply of fine wine, on the other hand, probably should not be. Take a look at the <a href="http://www.liv-ex.com/pages/static_page.jsp?pageId=100" type="external">wines that make up the fine wine index</a> that the IMF authors use: they?re mostly from 5-20 year old vintages. You can?t conjure more <a href="http://2020wines.com/1990-latour-750.html?utm_source=Vinquire&amp;amp;utm_medium=WineFeed&amp;amp;utm_content=1990+Latour&amp;amp;utm_campaign=base&amp;amp;v_traceback=c0112_1919_f0113_1314" type="external">1990 Latour</a> simply because Chinese demand is surging today. If both oil and wine prices behave similarly, then, it?s more natural to conclude that oil supply is similarly inflexible. That?s evidence in favor of oil supply being relatively unresponsive to price ? and hence evidence in favor of OPEC influence.</p>
<p>In any case, I look forward to reading a revised version of the paper in the <a href="http://www.wine-economics.org/journal/" type="external">Journal of Wine Economics</a>. <a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/rstavins/" type="external">One of its editors</a> even knows a thing or two about oil.</p>

<p>Oil prices are up again today. What?s going on? A look at history gives some interesting insights.</p>
<p>Eyal Dvir (Boston College) and Ken Rogoff (Harvard) have a <a href="https://share.bc.edu/sites/all/files/u10455/Dvir_Rogoff_Oil.pdf" type="external">very interesting working paper</a> that tries to explain some important features of oil prices since 1861. Jim Hamilton has a <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2011/01/the_first_oil_s.html" type="external">neat discussion</a>, over at Econbrowser, of the forces behind one particularly interesting episode, which he calls&amp;#160; ?the first oil shock.? Starting from $11.65 (in 2009 dollars) in 1861, the price of oil in the United States skyrocketed to a peak of $110.11 by 1864, before dropping back to $36.84 in 1867. The whopping 845% spike in the oil price dwarfs anything seen since.</p>
<p>The interesting question, here, regards the source of the shock ? and, in particular, whether there are any parallels to today. Hamilton argues that it was about technological limits to supply combined with idiosyncratic shifts in demand:</p>
<p>?Edwin Drake had drilled the first commercially successful oil well in Pennsylvania in 1859?. But it turned out that in each new well, the flow rate dropped fairly quickly as oil was removed, and the drillers also had difficulty figuring out how to prevent water flooding. After an initial phenomenal rate of success, total production from all wells in Pennsylvania declined in 1863 and fell further in 1864?. At the same time, the demand schedule was shifting to the right, due to war spending and most importantly a new tax on alcohol (a competitive source of illuminants) of $2/gallon, which gave a $40/barrel competitive advantage to crude. The result was that the real price of oil quintupled by 1864.?</p>
<p>Dvir and Rogoff, while not focusing as narrowly in time, argue that high oil price volatility in the period from 1861 to 1878 can be explained by much broader structural factors. The supply side, they argue, was artificially constrained due to a monopoly by railways on the transport of oil (broken only by the Tidewater pipeline in 1879). At the same time, the demand side was steadily climbing due to the rapid industrialization of the United States. Volatility in this period ? there were spikes again in 1871 and 1876 ? was due to these deeper drivers.</p>
<p>Both analyses draw parallels to today. Hamilton observes that the spike was relieved when people started to find oil in new places. He argues that this ? not technological progress ? is the real history of oil supply, and warns that today, there aren?t many new places to find oil. Dvir and Rogoff, for their part, observe a parallel between U.S. and East Asian industrialization (beginning in the mid to late 19th and 20th centuries respectively) on the demand side. On the supply side, OPEC replaces the rail monopoly in constraining supply and driving up both prices and volatility. This structural situation, they warn, tends to produce high volatility, and isn?t going away any time soon.</p>
<p>Who?s right? It?s quite possible that they both are. Strong growth in oil demand driven by economy-wide factors, combined with supply that is relatively unresponsive because of market structure, can amplify the broader consequences of what would otherwise be largely benign events in the oil markets. That looks like it was the case in the 1860s. The same appears to be true today.</p>

<p>Keith Bradsher <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/10/business/global/10solar.html?scp=1&amp;amp;sq=china%20solar&amp;amp;st=cse" type="external">reports</a> in yesterday?s New York Times that Congress is forcing the Defense Department to forego purchases of Chinese solar panels. My initial instinct was to scream ?Protectionism!? ? but there?s actually a strong case for what Congress is doing.</p>
<p>The situation is pretty straightforward. China hasn?t signed the WTO <a href="http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/gproc_e/gp_gpa_e.htm" type="external">agreement on government procurement</a>. That means that Chinese government purchases are exempt from China?s free trade obligations. But the state is a massive piece of the Chinese economy. In practice, then, Beijing uses that loophole to mandate domestic content for a huge amount of its economic activity. The United States, whose government is a much smaller part of the economy, can?t behave similarly. The result is a perfectly legal Chinese policy that is in practice unfair.</p>
<p>The response that Congress has forced on the Pentagon responds by using WTO law in a tit-for-tat fashion. The United States has signed the agreement on government procurement. That allows it to limit government contracts to other states that have signed the agreement too. That?s what Congress has told the Defense Department to do ? and, since China hasn?t signed the agreement, it will be left out.</p>
<p>This seems reasonable to me. It?s perfectly legal. It will help mollify some of the forces that are calling for much more draconian (and counterproductive) protectionist measures from the United States. It isn?t economically damaging to the United States in the way that broader trade barriers might be ? sure, the Pentagon will spend a bit more on solar panels, but not much. And it?s inherently limited: since the government is a limited part of the U.S. economy, there?s isn?t a huge danger of descending down a slippery slope.</p>
<p>But, for the same reason, I also wouldn?t expect it to yield much. The U.S. government procurement market is tiny compared to the size of the market that China is currently shielding from free trade rules. Beijing isn?t going to open up massive swathes of its economy just to sell a few solar panels to the Pentagon. The huge structural asymmetries between the U.S. and Chinese economies mean that WTO law provides only a limited guide to how best to approach the market access problem. More creative solutions ? and quite possibly more contentious ones ? will ultimately be required.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I?d have added a sixth entry: a U.S. or Israeli attack on Iran, and the ensuing impact on energy markets. My sense, though, is that the Iranian nuclear program is limping along slowly enough that that isn?t in the cards in 2011. Of course, we could always be surprised.</p>

<p>My <a href="" type="internal">post last week</a> on the ?Jevons Paradox? ? the claim that increased energy efficiency actually raises energy consumption ? generated a good bit of feedback, both in the comments and in my email. The <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/12/20/101220fa_fact_owen" type="external">New Yorker article</a> that inspired my post also spurred <a href="http://www.greatenergychallengeblog.com/2010/12/rebounds-gone-wild/" type="external">several</a> <a href="http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dgoldstein/some_dilemma_efficient_applian_1.html" type="external">strong</a> <a href="http://www.greatenergychallengeblog.com/2010/12/rebound-redux-have-we-moved-past-jevons-on-efficiency/" type="external">rebuttals</a> elsewhere.</p>
<p>Since energy efficiency is such a commonly discussed topic in energy policy, it?s worth addressing some of the most important concerns. Here are three that I think matter:</p>
<p>We can?t decarbonize economy unless we decarbonize our energy supplies, so how can energy efficiency ever solve our problems? It can?t, alone. But energy efficiency matters when economics and politics collide. Say my monthly electricity bill is $100. If policymakers want to force me to use renewable power, that bill might double ? and I might reject such a big increase. Now imagine that energy efficiency has let me cut my bill to $25. I might be more open to the doubling of energy prices, since my bill would now only increase by $25, and still be half of its original amount. Think about this another way: If we can double the efficiency of wind farms or solar panels, we?re thrilled. We should be just as pleased if we can double the efficiency of the things that wind farms and solar panels power.</p>
<p>What about the fact that people use more cars/AC/fridges/whatever? People are richer than they used to be. They use more stuff. Yes, the fact that these things have become cheaper (including through lower energy costs) also increases their use. But if you ignore income growth, you?re missing a huge part of the picture.</p>
<p>Haven?t you ignored the multiplier effect of energy efficiency savings? In my post, I argued that if I saved $100 on gasoline, and spent it on a broad basket of goods and services, I?d end up cutting into society?s energy savings by about $6-$8, since energy costs are about 6-8% of GDP. Several people pointed out that my $100 of spending can generate more than $100 in increased GDP, since my money can circulate through the economy multiple times. They?re right, and I was wrong: it?s plausible that my $100 of spending could increase GDP by as much as $200-$300. But that would still leave society with only $18-$24 in extra energy costs, and a big net savings in energy consumption.</p>
<p>Let me make myself clear: energy efficiency is often oversold as a policy panacea. Many energy efficiency policies that are sold as win-wins aren?t actually so once you account for all the costs. But to argue that promoting energy efficiency invariably undercuts progress toward curbing resource demand and greenhouse gas emissions is wrong.</p>

<p>If you haven?t seen Google?s new " <a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/" type="external">Ngram Viewer</a>", you?re missing out. The tool allows you to see how often any word shows up within Google?s massive database of books, and to graph how that evolves over time. (Here?s a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704073804576023741849922006.html" type="external">good run-down</a>in the Journal.) Without further ado, then, here are some interesting tidbits about energy and climate.</p>
<p>Energy and Security</p>
<p>Mentions of coal and oil <a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=coal,oil&amp;amp;year_start=1800&amp;amp;year_end=2008&amp;amp;corpus=0&amp;amp;smoothing=3" type="external">both spike around 1920</a>, just after World War I. (I?m looking at English language books here.) But by World War II, coal no longer matters to military success, so only oil jumps.</p>
<p><a href="" type="internal"></a></p>
<p>War, by the way, is <a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=war,oil&amp;amp;year_start=1900&amp;amp;year_end=2008&amp;amp;corpus=0&amp;amp;smoothing=3" type="external">nicely correlated with oil</a> in the first half of the 20th century, but after that, the two are pretty independent.</p>
<p><a href="" type="internal"></a></p>
<p>Coal begins a long decline around 1920, and is <a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=coal,oil,nuclear&amp;amp;year_start=1900&amp;amp;year_end=2008&amp;amp;corpus=0&amp;amp;smoothing=3" type="external">passed by nuclear in 1960</a>.</p>
<p><a href="" type="internal"></a></p>
<p>All three fuels make comebacks around 1980, when general interest in energy <a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=energy&amp;amp;year_start=1900&amp;amp;year_end=2008&amp;amp;corpus=5&amp;amp;smoothing=3" type="external">peaks too</a>, right after the big oil crises of the 1970s.</p>
<p><a href="" type="internal"></a></p>
<p>The rising tide of interest in energy lifts all boats: attention to solar and geothermal <a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=coal,oil,solar,geothermal&amp;amp;year_start=1960&amp;amp;year_end=2008&amp;amp;corpus=5&amp;amp;smoothing=3" type="external">both see record highs</a> at the same time, and use of the phrase ?alternative energy? <a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=alternative+energy&amp;amp;year_start=1900&amp;amp;year_end=2008&amp;amp;corpus=0&amp;amp;smoothing=3" type="external">spikes to highs</a> that we?re nowhere close to today.</p>
<p><a href="" type="internal"></a> <a href="" type="internal"></a></p>
<p>Environment and Climate Change</p>
<p>Environment <a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=environment&amp;amp;year_start=1960&amp;amp;year_end=2008&amp;amp;corpus=0&amp;amp;smoothing=3" type="external">has taken a downward turn</a> in the English language since 2000 (left) ? but, somewhat surprisingly, it keeps going up if you only look at <a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=environment&amp;amp;year_start=1960&amp;amp;year_end=2008&amp;amp;corpus=5&amp;amp;smoothing=3" type="external">books published in the United States</a> (right).</p>
<p><a href="" type="internal"></a> <a href="" type="internal"></a></p>
<p><a href="" type="internal"></a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>No matter how you slice things, it?s <a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=environment&amp;amp;year_start=1800&amp;amp;year_end=2008&amp;amp;corpus=5&amp;amp;smoothing=3" type="external">increased spectacularly over the last two hundred years</a>.</p>
<p><a href="" type="internal"></a></p>
<p>And regardless what pollsters tell you, climate change is <a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=Climate+Change,Energy+Security&amp;amp;year_start=1960&amp;amp;year_end=2008&amp;amp;corpus=0&amp;amp;smoothing=3" type="external">much more popular</a> (at least among authors) than energy security.</p>
<p><a href="" type="internal"></a></p>
<p>China</p>
<p>I desperately wanted to get some insight into China by looking at statistics on Chinese books. And I was rather excited when I found this disturbing <a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=war,oil&amp;amp;year_start=1900&amp;amp;year_end=2008&amp;amp;corpus=11&amp;amp;smoothing=3" type="external">correlation between ?war? and ?oil?</a>.</p>
<p><a href="" type="internal"></a></p>
<p>Then I threw in the words ?happy?, "rain, and "horse", and found <a href="http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/graph?content=war,oil,happy,horse,rain&amp;amp;year_start=1900&amp;amp;year_end=2000&amp;amp;corpus=11&amp;amp;smoothing=3" type="external">basically the same pattern</a>.</p>
<p><a href="" type="internal"></a></p>
<p>Unless someone can offer a crackerjack theory that explains why these words go together, I?m going to conclude for now that this part of the Ngram database isn?t ready for primetime. [UPDATE: It turns out that you need to enter Chinese. Duh! I?d thought that Google was running English input through a translator. Take a look at the comments for an excellent Chinese graph.]</p>

<p><a href="" type="internal"></a></p>
<p><a href="" type="internal"></a>I took the picture in this post somewhere outside of Tehran in early 2006. The number at the bottom is the price of gasoline ? at the time, a massively subsidized 800 rials (about 8 cents) per liter, equivalent to about 30 cents per gallon. As of a few days ago, the price of gasoline was still 1000 rials per liter for the first 60 liters a month. On Saturday night, though, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704138604576029170655459688.html?mod=googlenews_wsj" type="external">the Iranian president announced</a> that subsidies would be abruptly slashed. Each of the first 60 liters of gasoline per person will now cost 4000 rials (about $1.50 per gallon), and additional gasoline will go for 7000 rials per liter (about $2.70 per gallon).</p>
<p>What?s prompting this price hike, and what will the consequences be? The Iranian government spends tens of billions of dollars each year subsidizing gasoline consumption. That?s money that the financially squeezed government could be spending elsewhere. Press reports <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/99dad808-0b90-11e0-a313-00144feabdc0.html#axzz18epZKnN0" type="external">have been emphasizing this factor</a>: Iran is also ending subsidies for a host of other basic commodities, and hopes to save as much as $100 billion each year.</p>
<p>I?m surprised, though, not to have seen another angle: Iran is struggling to match gasoline supply with demand. Despite being an oil exporter, Iran imported about forty percent of its gasoline until recently, in order to make up for a shortage of domestic refining capacity. U.S. and European sanctions have, however, prompted many of its suppliers to pull back in the last year. Iran has <a href="http://www.upi.com/Science_News/Resource-Wars/2010/12/14/Iran-gasoline-consumption-drops/UPI-40381292332222/" type="external">apparently managed to temporarily bridge the gap</a> by switching some of its petrochemical plants to produce gasoline, but that?s undoubtedly even more costly than paying for imports.</p>
<p>Higher gasoline prices should help ease the strain by curbing demand. How much? This sort of thing is inevitably very difficult to predict, but we can make a crude estimate. A <a href="http://www.seec.surrey.ac.uk/Research/SEEDS/SEEDS117.pdf" type="external">recent paper</a> by three economists at Tehran University and the University of Surrey surveys estimates of elasticities of gasoline demand in Iran. The short-run price elasticity of gasoline demand appears to be somewhere between -0.1 and -0.15. If that?s right, a fourfold increase in gasoline prices should translate into a cut of approximately 10-20% in gasoline consumption. This would make a material contribution to addressing Iran?s sanctions-induced challenge. Indeed as I write this, the Iranian oil ministry <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKAL06226420101220" type="external">is reporting</a> a 16.6% drop in gasoline consumption from Saturday to Sunday ? though it?s impossible to know how much of that is driven by the price hike, and how much is the result of other factors.</p>
<p>Setting that aside, there are important caveats, beyond the simple fact that the past studies might not be all that good. Higher gasoline prices normally curb demand in part by shifting it to other products. But because Iran is hiking the prices of a wide range of other products too, that effect might be reduced. Moreover, a fourfold increase in gasoline prices is way outside the range of past experience; it may not be possible for drivers to quickly reduce their gasoline use as much as theory predicts.</p>
<p>Regardless, the big question now is how this all goes over in Iran. Police <a href="http://www.upi.com/Science_News/Resource-Wars/2010/12/20/Iran-tense-as-subsidies-end/UPI-49691292854048/" type="external">are bracing</a> for violence. It probably won?t be long until we know how this plays out.</p>

<article id="0000026" published-at="2016-01-13" title="The Long Road to Harvard"><p>As reported in the New York Times on December 29, 2015, Vonette Zachary Bright, an important Evangelical leader, has died at age 89. She was born in 1926, the daughter of a farmer in Cowetah, Oklahoma. She received a bachelor?s degree in home economics from Texas Woman?s University, and went on to a master?s degree in education from the University of Southern California (definitely a step up). Subsequently she wrote a dozen books. It strikes me that she was born one year after the so-called ?monkey trial? in Dayton, Tennessee, when a schoolteacher was tried for teaching evolution in defiance of state law. The trial, written up by H.L. Mencken, turned into a historic battle about the veracity of the Bible between Clarence Darrow, the famous defense attorney, and William Jennings Bryan, an equally famous Evangelical politician, who spoke on behalf of the prosecution. Bryan?s public humiliation in this debate was a turning point in the history of American Evangelicals, who retreated for several decades into a subculture despised by the cultural elite. Vonette Bright?s life span saw not just one but several changes in that turbulent history. This invites reflection.</p>
<p>In 1951 she and her husband William R. Bright (whom she had known since grade school) founded Campus Crusade for Christ, originally a student ministry at the University of California, Los Angeles. Bill Bright, as he was generally known, died in 2003. He graduated in economics from Northeastern State University in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. (Neither Bright could be accused of having been shaped by elite academia.) The organization they founded has now grown into a huge international organization, probably the largest in the Evangelical world. With headquarters in Orlando, Florida, it now claims 25,000 full time staff and 300,000 volunteers in 175 countries. No longer limited to campus ministry, it now covers a much broader spectrum of activities. Because of this it has now changed its name to just Cru (a not very happy choice, I would say, but the old name is still used). In 1966 the Brights founded Athletes in Action, thus carrying on a venerable tradition of ?muscular Christianity?, which long ago also gave birth to the YMCA. [I think it goes back to the British public school whose pedagogical maxim was ?make them so exhausted that they forget about sex??not a very successful strategy, it seems.]</p>
<p>Since 1976 Campus Crusade has conducted a ?family life program??with conferences, small groups and individual marriage counseling, advocating what in those circles is usually called ?the traditional family? (which historically is actually the bourgeois family, a tradition about as old as the steam engine). It is fair to see this as a campaign against all the consequences of the sexual revolution that began not long before the ?family life program?. The latter has hardly been a great success, except in the deeper recesses of the Evangelical subculture. [There you can find such scintillating phenomena as ?virgin clubs??young women making a vow to remain virgins until marriage, wearing a ring with an inscription to that effect, and attending large annual conferences to ?renew their vows??accompanied by their fathers, who might see this as practice for ?giving away? their daughters to the putative deflowerers.]</p>
<p>Campus Crusade?s most ambitious initiative has been the Jesus Film Project, launched in 1979. The Brights wanted to produce a film that would be ?Biblically correct? yet have all the technical sophistication of a top Hollywood production. It is based on the text of the Gospel of Luke. Wealthy donors initially supported the project to the tune of about six million dollars. It has been a vast undertaking, not least linguistically: The film has been dubbed in over one thousand languages. So even illiterate viewers can hear Jesus speaking in Hindi, or Swaheli, or Quecha. A large screen has been developed on which the film can be seen from both sides simultaneously, for large gatherings of viewers. It is claimed that some 200 million people have seen the film. The aim of the project is that before long every person on earth will have had the opportunity to see the film and thus have the option to make a decision for Jesus (some Evangelicals believe that this will hasten the Second Coming). After each big showing staff go around and ask who might be interested in learning more about Jesus; those who say yes are asked for their contact information; they are later visited by local pastors or church workers. Some years ago I had the occasion to ask someone from Campus Crusade whether this procedure is not resented in some places. Yes, they replied, and spreading the Gospel has often been dangerous and sometimes may lead to martyrdom.</p>
<p>Revivalism has of course been an important feature of Evangelical Protestantism in America, ever since the First Great Awakening in the 18th century, followed by the flowering of Methodism and innumerable local revivalists, and other large movements of similar intensity. The period in which Campus Crusade first flourished, 1950s and 1960s, has been called by some a Fourth Great Awakening. During this last period there were other movements that began on college campuses, notably the Intervarsity Christian Fellowhip, begun in 1941, operating today on 649 campuses in the US and some abroad, but it cannot compare with the size of Campus Crusade.</p>
<p>Probably most important during this period has been the meteoric rise of Billy Graham, who began his ?crusades? in 1947 and, though (now in his nineties) he has turned over a highly organized enterprise to his son Frank Graham, who has continued to be a religious celebrity. Billy Graham is liked and admired by people who do not share his beliefs. In some ways he resembles the Dalai Lama, though his spirituality is more noisy (no Buddhist tranquility here!). While rarely making political statements, he has been cultivated by presidents beginning with Dwight Eisenhower (who made the famous statement of his profound respect for faith, ?I don?t care what it is?).</p>
<p>I would venture to say that the core features of the Evangelical revival have persisted in all these manifestations: a constant appeal to Biblical authority, an urgent appeal to repent before it is too late, and then the ?call to come to the altar?, be converted in a highly emotional way, and enter into a ?personal relationship with Jesus?. There are of course different variants, but this is the ?deep structure? of a very distinctive type of religion, whether in one of Billy Graham?s rallies of many thousands in a football stadium, or in the first revival I ever attended, in a humble Evangelical church in Springfield, Ohio. [I went out of curiosity with my then Finnish girlfriend. She became very tense as the preacher?s helpers fanned out to invite people to come to the altar. As one of them leaned over and asked ?sister, are you saved?? she replied in her strong accent ?I am a member of the Church of Finland?. A wonderful clash between two very different versions of the Christian religion!]</p>
<p>Campus Crusade for Christ started in 1951. What has happened to American Evangelicanism since then? Around that date it had just begun to rouse itself from the depressed marginality into which it had retreated from the debacle in Dayton, Tennessee. An era of publicity-wise mass evangelism, of which Billy Graham was the shining exemplar, had begun. The combination of Evangelical piety and ?traditional values? was a good fit with the robust patriotism of the Cold War. Yet Evangelicals were still wary of plunging confidently into the political arena (probably their last foray was with the Temperance movement that culminated in Prohibition, a Pyrrhic victory if ever there was one!). For a while they pinned hope on Jimmy Carter, the peanut farmer from Georgia, one of their own. But although he taught Sunday school every week, his presidency (1977-1981) was a disappointment. Evangelicals were most upset by the sexual revolution of the 1960s and the 1970s, and the feminist and gay movements that were rising in tandem. So there was reason to hope when Carter convoked the White House Conference on the Family. But the liberationist caucus that had already been on the ascendancy in the Democratic Party pressured the administration to change the topic of the conference from ?the family? to ?families?. Carter collapsed before this aggression as readily as he did before the Islamist students occupying the U.S. embassy in Tehran&amp;#160;(he did send an under-equipped rescue team that failed to get there). An irate group of conservative delegates (many of them Evangelicals) walked out of the conference in protest. That was the end of what one admirer of the administration had called ?the end of the secular Enlightenment?.</p>
<p>The administration of Ronald Reagan, which followed immediately, clearly heralded a change in the political climate. Jerry Falwell, a militantly Evangelical Baptist preacher, had already founded the Moral Majority in 1979; ideologically similar groups followed. The so-called New Christian Right burst on the political scene and was poised to become an important constituency for the Republican Party. The religious difference between the two parties, geographically expressed in the ideological difference between Oklahoma and Harvard Yard, persists as an important aspects of U.S. politics. It was perfectly caught in Barack Obama?s (presumably unguarded) characterization of his political opponents as people clinging to their religion and their guns. What also happened during the Reagan administration was the rather uneasy political alliance between Christian conservatives (Evangelical and Catholic) and the heavily Jewish intellectuals of the neoconservative movement. This was definitely not a marriage made in heaven, but it worked for a while politically. (The unease in the relationship was mitigated by the fact that Evangelicals, because of their understanding of the Old Testament, are strongly pro-Israel.)</p>
<p>Politics can change quite quickly. Cultural changes are usually slower and may not be noticed for a while. What was been happening more gradually than American politics was the effect of social mobility on the Evangelical community. The cultural association of Evangelicals with Tobacco Road was becoming less plausible as Evangelicals grew richer and more educated. In 1994 the historian Mark Noll, who is Evangelical himself, published The Scandal of the Evangelical Mind, which castigates his coreligionists for being anti-intellectual; ironically things were changing by then. Evangelicals are acquiring an intelligentsia of their own. There is now a network of Evangelical centers?universities, think tanks, publications. Significant academic centers are Baylor University, Calvin College, Gordon College, Wheaton College, and Fuller Theological Seminary. These institutions have faculty members with degrees from excellent universities in the US and abroad. The students, insofar as I have encountered them, are of two distinct lots:&amp;#160;some are as good as any in elite universities, others come from institutions that few have ever heard about, but are bright and eager to prove how good they can be.</p>
<p>There is an interesting fact to consider here: Faculty selection in elite institutions is biased in terms of the ideological prejudices in the selection process, with thoughts such as these in the minds of those on hiring committees: ?we may have enough women applicants to satisfy federal diversity requirements, and (though we are not really allowed to ask) it seems that this candidate is a woman, but is she likely to be acceptable (that means ideologically acceptable) to the Department of Gender and Sexuality Studies?? Such questions are somewhat less likely to be raised in the case of student applicants, who after all are by definition still available for correct indoctrination (though of course there are still the legal or not so legal quotas for those labelled ?federally protected groups?). In the top category of this new Evangelical intelligentsia there are scholars with impeccable credentials who, if they so choose, could just as well be employed by non-Evangelical elite universities. Among them are the aforementioned historian Mark Noll (who moved from Wheaton College to Notre Dame) and the philosopher Alvin Platinga (who moved from Calvin College, also to Notre Dame).</p>
<p>This is a new phenomenon. It is comparable to the movement of Jews, especially after World War II, into academic institutions (not to mention private clubs and classy neighborhoods) from which they were previously excluded. ?Fundamentalism?, a category that in the progressive lexicon of elite secular culture includes both Evangelicals and conservative Catholics, is still (uneasily) acceptable in faculty clubs. Anti-Semitism is, still, considered taboo, unless one wants to apply the term (sometimes fairly, sometimes not) to the often passionate anti-Israel sentiments prevalent in progressive academia. Where is this going? In his book The New Evangelicals (1987) the sociologist James Davison Hunter anticipated that younger and better-educated Evangelicals would come to resemble the more secularized mainline Protestants. This has not quite come to pass. To be sure, some of the more robustly anti-modern beliefs of many Evangelical are difficult to hold onto if one has acquired a modicum of tertiary education?like the belief in the ?inerrancy? of Scripture even in the account of creation (the beautifully named ?young earth theory? aka ?creationism?), or in the surviving rigid moral codes (relevant joke: Why are Southern Baptists against extra-marital sex? Because it might lead to dancing!). But I don?t see that the core beliefs of Evangelical Protestantism, as outlined before in my description of revivalism, have significantly diminished (somewhat mellowed perhaps, emphasizing the promise of heaven over the threat of hell). Evangelicals have not moved in the direction of Unitarians (another relevant joke: What happens when you cross a Unitarian with a Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan? You get someone who burns a question on your front lawn!). Compared to the theologically liberal, they are remarkably feisty.</p>
<p>The Veritas Forum was founded in 1986, a very interesting case of the new Evangelical intelligentsia. Its purpose is defined as the open discussion in academic settings of ?the relevance of Jesus Christ to all of life??the emphasis is on discussion, not preaching. Christian perspectives are of course introduced, but always in conversation with critics of Christianity or religiously neutral experts in various fields. The program began at Harvard; its headquarters is still in Cambridge, Massachusetts. As far as I know, the organization is well-funded. Its young and very well educated staff conducts programs in fifty institutions, mostly in the U.S., some in Europe. The intellectual level is consistently high. The organization reminds me a bit of Opus Dei, the conservative Catholic order whose avowed aim is to infiltrate elite institutions, including universities, with Catholic ideas and values. The Veritas Forum does this with a measure of chutzpah symbolized by its name?which of course simply means truth in Latin, the Christian truth claims with which the organization unabashedly identifies?but which so happens is also on the logo of Harvard University. (It is an old military custom to display captured enemy banners in victory parades!)</p>
<p>The Veritas modus operandi is twofold: big public events, usually with well-known individuals, and also (usually before and/or after the public event) small-group discussions of the public topics, often at the Harvard Faculty Club. I had had contacts with the group before, but in October 2015 I was invited to have a public event about religious pluralism with Ross Douthat, a conservative Catholic and (nevertheless) a regular columnist of the New York Times. The event was intelligently planned and very well attended. The Venue, Harvard Memorial Church, was appropriate in view of the Forum?s stated purpose. For one, it is ur-Harvard: Located in the center of the campus, the present building was built in 1932, but its architectural predecessors conducted daily morning prayers and Sunday services ever since 1636. I knew its last senior minister who died in 2011?Peter Gomes, a Baptist, whose father came from the Cape Verde Islands and whose mother was African-American. He was an erudite man who refused to be intellectually imprisoned in any narrow category. He was a theologically conservative Evangelical, a registered Republican, and openly gay. This particular combination is not exactly typically Harvard. All the same, he was generally well-liked?he was open-minded, witty and an eloquent preacher. (In all those respects, I would say, rather different from Josemaria Escriva, the founder of Opus Dei!)</p></article>

<p>Let us say on the front end that we love Katy Tur, which means we are #BIAS. She is so smart and good and funny and delightful, and if yr gay-ass Wonkette may be allowed a brief moment of heterosexuality, she is SO PRETTY YOU GUYS OMG.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Trump harassed the shit out of Tur&amp;#160;constantly during the campaign. He absolutely loved it when she covered his rallies, so he could rile up his cousin-fucking hordes in rage over how the fake news is lying to America. About a week before the election, Trump <a href="" type="internal">screamed the following</a> at her, because THERE?S SOMETHING HAPPENING, KATY, YOU?RE NOT REPORTING IT, KATY!</p>
<p>KATY, YOU?RE NOT REPORTING IT, KATY. BUT THERE?S SOMETHING HAPPENING, KATY. THERE?S SOMETHING HAPPENING, KATY.</p>
<p>And he pointed at her like this, so the human tubes of expired Easy Cheese at his rally knew EXACTLY which offending journalist, who just happened to be a young woman, was NOT REPORTING IT, KATY!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Trump does this because he is a sexist piece of shit who gets the world?s tiniest erections (which also happen to be his biggest) over exerting creepy filthy chauvinist power over women.</p>
<p>Trump also tweeted during the campaign at various times about Tur, saying she was a ?3rd rate reporter? who ?lied? and ?should be fired.? You know, usual third-grade level Trump stuff.</p>
<p>But hey, don?t take all that to suggest Trump doesn?t think Katy Tur is FUCKIN? HOT, or that he doesn?t want to grab her by the pussy and take her furniture shopping. Taegan Goddard <a href="https://politicalwire.com/2017/09/12/quote-of-the-day-1719/" type="external">posted a quote</a> from Tur?s book Tuesday morning, about this one time Trump tried to grope her on the set of ?Morning Joe?:</p>
<p>?Before I know what?s happening, his hands are on my shoulders and his lips are on my cheek. My eyes widen. My body freezes. My heart stops. Fuck. I hope the cameras didn?t see that. My bosses are never going to take me seriously.?</p>
<p>Fucking hell, he is beyond deplorable. GET YOUR HANDS AND YOUR ORANGE FACE AND YOUR APPLEHEADED VAGINA MOUTH OFF OF KATY TUR, PRESIDENT RAPE VAN, RIGHT THE FUCK NOW!</p>
<p>Get the context here! He was verbally abusing Katy Tur from the stage constantly and on Twitter, and yet the physically repulsive pile of hardened cat vomit currently manspreading all over the Oval Office thought it would be cool to get all up on her, like maybe if he stuck his gelatinous tongue in her mouth, she would start reporting that SOMETHING IS HAPPENING, KATY.</p>
<p>Also, how fucked up is it that Tur?s first thought was that her bosses wouldn?t take HER seriously if they saw Trump advancing on her? And they say sexism is dead. (Just kidding, they don?t say that. But don?t mention it, especially if you?re Hillary Clinton!)</p>
<p>MSNBC <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/excerpt-katy-turs-unbelievable-0" type="external">released</a> a longer excerpt from Tur?s book, and oh boy, if you didn?t click the link to pre-order above, you will after you read this account from election night, when Tur realized that, just as she suspected, Trump would win the election:</p>
<p>My brutal, crazy, exasperating year with Trump is going to end ? by not ending at all. Trump will be president. The most powerful person in the world. And I will be locked in a press pen for the rest of my life. Does anyone really believe he?ll respect term limits? I have a vision of myself at sixty, Trump at a hundred, in some midwestern convention hall. The children of his 2016 supporters are spitting on me, and he is calling my name: ?She?s back there, Little Katy! She?s back there.? [?]</p>
<p>I?ve heard him insult a war hero, brag about grabbing women by the pussy, denigrate the judicial system, demonize immigrants, fight with the pope, doubt the democratic process, advocate torture and war crimes, tout the size of his junk in a presidential debate, trash the media, and endanger my life.</p>
<p>I?ve learned that none of this matters to an Electoral College majority of American voters. They?ve decided that this menacing, indecent, post-truth landscape is where they want to live for the next four years.</p>
<p>Tur got literal death threats while she was covering Trump?s campaign, because that?s the kind of thing Trump?s example emboldens his stable of pigs to do to people. Indeed, according to her excerpt, a staffer told her during the campaign that, second to Trump, Secret Service paid the most attention to her during events, in order to protect her from them.</p>
<p>We are glad, for Katy Tur?s health and sanity, and for the quality of MSNBC?s daytime news operation, that instead of forcing her to stay in Donald Trump?s loathsome presence all the time, the network just gave her her own show. It?s much better that way.</p>

<article id="0000032" published-at="2016-06-05" title="DIRTY: Hillary Clinton Implies Trump is a Nazi ?He?s of German Heritage? (VIDEO)"><p></p>
<p>Do you want to know why violent unhinged leftists are treating Trump as if he was the second coming of Hitler? It?s because leading Democrats and members of the liberal media keep calling him that.</p>
<p>The New York Post has <a href="http://nypost.com/2016/06/05/hes-of-german-heritage-hillary-baits-fans-into-calling-trump-nazi/" type="external">the latest instance of this:</a></p>
<p>He?s of ?German heritage?: Hillary baits fans into calling Trump a Nazi</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton lobbed the video equivalent of a Nazi buzz bomb at Donald Trump on Saturday by making his German heritage a campaign issue.</p>
<p>The 37-second clip decrying Trump?s attacks on federal Judge Gonzalo Curiel?s Mexican heritage was subtle ? but fans and foes got the message: Clinton thinks Trump, like the Nazis, hates people based on their race.</p>
<p>?His heritage is German. Heil Trump!? tweeted Trump foe Michael Gilmor?.</p>
<p>?We can all hear the ?dog whistle? ? she?s calling ?Drumpf? a Nazi because he?s German,? posted James Sweitzer.</p>
<p>The clip, backed by ominous music and linked on Twitter, ostensibly concerns Trump?s continued attacks on Curiel, who is presiding over class-action lawsuits brought by Trump University students who claim they were ripped off.</p>
<p>Curiel was born in Indiana to Mexican immigrants. Trump, who wants to build a wall between the US and Mexico and deport illegal immigrants, says Curiel?s heritage makes the judge biased against him.</p>
<p>?We are dealing with somebody who is a demagogue, who would rip up our most valued beliefs,? Clinton says in the video clip.</p>
<p>Here?s the video, skip to the -4:00 mark:</p>
<p></p>
<p>None of this is new.</p>

<article id="0000037" published-at="2015-01-12" title="A Bipartisan Work Plan"><p>American workers continue to struggle with lost livelihoods and wasted opportunities amid the most sluggish recovery since the Great Depression. The United States needs new policies designed to help people develop the skills they need to manage economic change with greater personal security. A jobs policy overhaul should be guided by three core principles: concentrate on jobs for the long-term unemployed; supplement wages, when necessary, to encourage employers to increase hiring; and relax congressional budget rules for programs that help people become earners and increase future tax revenues. These efforts should also be measured and evaluated far more effectively to bolster programs that work and eliminate those that fail.</p>
<p>In today's troubled labor market, many people with rusty skills and fading hopes have quit looking for work altogether?as evidenced by today's labor force participation rate that remains markedly below its precrisis level. Less-skilled workers, minorities, and teenagers have been especially hard hit. In October 2014, nearly three million Americans had been unemployed for half a year or longer, and millions more have dropped out of the labor force. Yet at the same time, there were nearly five million job openings across the country. This mismatch is a human disaster that should be solved with aggressive policy innovation and the same resolve and whatever-it-takes attitude that the United States applies to natural disasters.</p>

<p>Both the House and Senate, with broad bipartisan support, agreed in 2014 on a Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to reform job training. This legislation is a constructive start toward a larger effort to create a twenty-first-century system that links people directly to jobs. The new act streamlines the old job training system by eliminating fifteen redundant programs, applying a single set of metrics for outcomes, creating more flexibility for state and local efforts, and targeting special needs such as people with disabilities and young workers. But Congress needs to keep up the momentum for continuing innovation by reaching beyond traditional committee jurisdictions and approaches to job training.</p>
<p>In his 2014 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama identified the overlooked opportunity to retool worker-adjustment programs and directed Vice President Joseph Biden to lead a review. If the administration is able to close some major trade agreements, then Congress will also debate whether a revision of Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) should be part of the package. Traditional TAA spending, which is designed to offset the costs associated with import competition and outsourcing, has often missed the mark. Moreover, at roughly $1 billion a year, TAA amounts to only about 5 percent of total federal worker-adjustment assistance.</p>
<p>At the state level, there are some encouraging new developments. Governors of both parties are customizing worker training to fit private-sector skill shortages through partnerships with companies, apprentice programs, and links to technical colleges and local universities. Last January, Governor Scott Walker (R-WI) announced specific actions in his State of the State address, including "A Better Bottom Line," an employment program for people with disabilities, inspired by an initiative of Governor Jack Markell (D-DE). A focus on helping veterans move into civilian jobs would further broaden the appeal of such bipartisan plans.</p>
<p>A jobs-policy overhaul should be guided by three core principles. First, all government efforts should concentrate on getting people?especially the long-term unemployed?jobs, instead of setting wages or just paying for training. The private sector should be drawn into the process, because private employers better grasp the needs, skills, and types of training required. On-the-job training, or training directly linked to job placement, offers both fundamental skills and employment. Government should help by removing barriers to work, such as overbearing, costly licensing requirements and constraints on job sharing.</p>
<p>Second, if wages for entry-level jobs are too low for a living, supplement them with direct add-ons, such as wage subsidies or an expanded earned income tax credit. It is better to get the unemployed working again than to pay people to wait or artificially boost wages beyond workers' initial productivity or contribution to a business.</p>

<p>Third, Congress should relax its rigid budget rules for programs that put people back to work. Innovations that return people to the workforce?such as relocation assistance for the long-term unemployed, transitional wage subsidies, and lump-sum unemployment payments?will increase overall economic output and generate new tax revenues that offset some of the costs. Congress should recognize this dynamic process in its budget-scoring rules.</p>
<p>Taxpayers may be more willing to support public innovation if the government rigorously evaluates the results of new jobs programs and ends those that do not work. Accountability requires outcome measures, which are scarce in government. The Department of Labor currently spends only 0.1 percent of its employment-and-training budget on evaluation. The unemployed deserve access to what works rather than the perpetuation of programs that may not be effective. Instead of just adding layer upon layer of training programs, the government should cultivate a policy culture that experiments and tests?and then fixes, ends, or expands. An accountable government is more likely to be permitted and encouraged to adapt to changing needs.</p>
<p>How might these principles work in practice? Consider one proposal to get the long-term unemployed into jobs: a temporary wage subsidy for employers who hire the long-term unemployed.</p>
<p>Granted to the employer, a wage subsidy would reduce the effective wage a company would need to pay its new employee, inducing companies to hire more people than they otherwise would. This subsidy would benefit society by helping people regain employment, thereby avoiding future costs of continued long-term unemployment. This approach would harness the incentives and knowledge of the private sector. Private companies, not the government, would decide who to hire.</p>
<p>The subsidy need not be large to create the right incentives. In 2013, earnings of full-time, year-round workers averaged about $50,900 for men and $40,600 for women. Many long-term unemployed probably earned less than these averages before they lost work. Perhaps $10,000 per worker over the first twelve months of employment would be enough and then $5,000 more over the next twelve months. To induce a company to retain a new hire for a meaningful time, wage subsidies could be paid after periods of work?for example, every three or six months.</p>
<p>The main objection to such a scheme is the cost, but, in fact, wage subsidies would be a good deal for taxpayers. The fiscal cost of this wage subsidy depends on the number of new hires the program seeks to assist. An ambitious target of half a million new jobs per year equals about 25 percent of the new payroll jobs created, on average, in each of the past four years. For that hiring goal, the direct program cost would be about $5 billion in its first year and $7.5 billion thereafter. These costs would be offset by gains from larger payroll-tax revenues and, over time, a larger labor force. By enabling people to work, the program would boost output and taxes, while reducing federal transfer payments. If Congress recognizes these dynamic benefits, the net annual cost of this wage subsidy would be a fraction of its direct cost?and produce substantial human gains that are well worth the investment.</p>
<p>A plan for "Helping America to Work" should encompass a number of other specific policies to help link workers to jobs, including the following:</p>
<p>Leaders of both parties have an opportunity to press a modern agenda for work, assistance, and trade. A vibrant economic recovery would tap the work and capabilities of every American. New policies, combined with rigorous evaluation of results, can do a far better job of putting Americans back to work.&amp;#160;</p></article>

<article id="0000077" published-at="2017-08-07" title="We know more about other planets? moons than our own ocean floor"><p>This&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.newsdeeply.com/oceans/articles/2017/08/03/hopes-and-fears-for-ambitious-project-to-map-the-entire-seabed" type="external">story</a> was originally published by <a href="https://www.newsdeeply.com/oceans" type="external">Oceans Deeply</a>. For important news about seafloor mapping, you can sign up to the <a href="http://newsdeeply.us5.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=8b78e9a34ff7443ec1e8c62c6&amp;amp;id=dfde037196" type="external">Oceans Deeply email list</a>.</p>
<p>When a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Sumatra on Dec. 26, 2004, a tsunami quickly formed, sending a wave as high as 80 feet (24 meters) across the Indian Ocean that, along with the earthquake, killed more than 230,000 people.</p>
<p>But it wasn?t just the earthquake that propelled the finger of the highest wave: It was also the topography of the sea floor. For instance, along the Southwest Indian Ridge, a skinny contour of shallow water south and east of Madagascar, the 2004 tsunami was as high in some places as it was off the coast of India.</p>
<p>A better map of the seabed could lead to the ability to warn people where a tsunami will be biggest, potentially saving lives, and better tsunami prediction models are just one reason for <a href="https://seabed2030.gebco.net/" type="external">an exceedingly ambitious new effort</a>, launched in June, to map the entire sea floor by 2030. The resolution will vary by depth, but will generally be 328 feet (100 meters). Just 5 percent of the ocean, which covers 71 percent of the Earth?s surface, is currently mapped in such detail. We know more about the topography of other planets? moons than we do of our own ocean floor.</p>
<p>?There are so many uses for this data,? said Martin Jakobsson, professor of marine geology and geophysics at Stockholm University and head of its department of geological sciences. He is lead author of the&amp;#160; <a href="http://seabed2030.gebco.net/documents/seabed_2030_roadmap_v10_low.pdf" type="external">road map</a> for the <a href="https://seabed2030.gebco.net/" type="external">Seabed 2030</a> project, initiated by the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans, an international organization under the International Hydrological Organization and the International Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO, funded in large part by the Nippon Foundation, a Japan-based nonprofit dedicated to social innovation.</p>
<p>Jakobsson?s work deals mainly with the marine cryosphere ? ice sheets that extend into the ocean. Identifying sills along the coasts, which affect the flow of warmer water into coastal glaciers, will be one benefit of the new database. Other benefits include understanding circulation patterns that affect climate and tides, improving fisheries management, locating underwater hazards, and finding a potential wealth of new information about the biodiversity of the largely unexplored deep sea.</p>
<p>?Mapping the seafloor is a great thing for science and can help conservation,? said Kristina M. Gjerde, senior high seas adviser for the Global Marine and Polar Program at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, source of the well-known ?red list? of endangered species. ?Often the places with the highest level of biological diversity are in places with a seamount or trench, where there are more currents and more nutrients. This will give us an idea of where to look for areas, including corridors for connectivity, where we can add protections.?</p>
<p>Seabed 2030 will be a vast and complex undertaking that integrates multiple technologies. The ridges seen in Google Earth, for instance, are from satellite altimetry. ?That?s a fantastic technology that gives the level of the sea surface and you can derive what?s underneath from gravity changes,? said Jakobsson. ?But it won?t give the resolution you need.? Such data is a starting point. Satellite imagery can also help, but only in clear water, and only at depths where light transmits. It?s the same with LIDAR, which is similar to radar but uses lasers instead of sound waves.</p>
<p>Half the ocean floor is under more than 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) of water, so to get 100 meters resolution at depth will require echo sounding from an enormous network of ships, autonomous underwater vehicles, and unmanned surface vessels. Jakobsson?s team calculated it would take 970 years for one ship using the latest multi-beam echo sounding technology, which covers a broader swath of seafloor than single-beam, to achieve Seabed 2030?s goal. Funding 80 ships to spend the next 12 years traveling the high seas with a multi-beam echo sounder 24/7 would be just as difficult.</p>
<p>So the first step is to find out what information is already out there but unknown to the scientific community; nations and industry are believed to have already conducted high-resolution seafloor mapping that?s not publicly available. If those entities are convinced that releasing such information will result in their acquiring even more data once Seabed 2030 is complete, they may be motivated to participate.</p>
<p>Crowdsourcing will also be key: The fishing industry, cruise ships, and even pleasure boats can chip in valuable data. ?They all use echo sounders so they don?t crash into each other in the dark,? Jakobsson pointed out. ?Mostly they use single-beam, but they go out so often that when you put it all together, the resolution turns out to be close to multi-beam.?</p>
<p>The next step will be to collate and organize that data using existing software. Then Seabed 2030 will divide the globe into regions, each with an editorial board that will prioritize areas that haven?t been mapped. Jakobsson hopes to leverage existing scientific missions so they can collect and contribute data, but in the end, he figures, targeted Seabed 2030 missions will be necessary. ?I don?t think we can do 100 of them, but if you can get everybody on board and get the funding for a whole suite of expeditions, this is doable.?</p>
<p>However, conservation groups have expressed concerns about the repercussions of Seabed 2030?s data becoming widely available, as well as about the consequences of the data collection effort itself.</p>
<p>?What is the impact of that sound wave through the ocean?? asked Gjerde. ?One thing that would be helpful is an environmental impact assessment of the effect this is going to have on sea turtles, whales, fish ? even plankton can be sensitive to some equipment. What they?re using is not equivalent to a seismic survey, but are there better times to do it, or other ways to minimize the impacts??</p>
<p>Duncan Currie, an international lawyer who advises the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, pointed out that during the search for the Malaysian Airlines flight that disappeared in 2014, fishing boats collected loads of data on the seafloor off Western Australia. ?A lot of information was gained on the seabed, but it also gave quite a lot of information about where potential fishing areas may be. So an obvious concern is that the&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.newsdeeply.com/oceans/articles/2017/07/17/the-new-technology-that-promises-to-blow-up-illegal-fishing" type="external">irresponsible fishing industry</a> will fish them out before they are even assessed.?</p>
<p>Over the next three weeks, the&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.isa.org.jm/" type="external">International Seabed Authority</a> is meeting in Jamaica partly to develop environmental regulations governing deep-sea mining. ?If the regulations are sound and effective and include protected areas, it will be important for scientists to know what?s out there and to have access to the same information as mining companies have,? said Gjerde. ?Seabed 2030 is a model for international collaboration that would be very usefully emulated to study how things live out there.?</p></article>
<article id="0000079" published-at="2015-08-24" title="For Now, Texas Economy Shrugs Off Low Oil Prices"><p>*Correction appended.</p>
<p>Just one short year ago, Texas drilling country rumbled with activity and high expectations that the good times would last a long while.</p>
<p>So much for that.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Amid a plunge in oil prices, the bonanza has paused at the very least, wiping out thousands of jobs in the oilfields and communities dependent on them.</p>
<p>The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. <a href="" type="internal">Become one</a>.</p>
<p>A barrel of West Texas crude is selling&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;amp;s=rwtc&amp;amp;f=w" type="external">near $40</a>&amp;#160;these days, the lowest since 2009, when Texas was struggling to shake the effects of the global financial crisis.&amp;#160;The state&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/swe/2010/swe1001b.pdf" type="external">lost nearly 340,000 jobs</a>&amp;#160;that year, and its unemployment rate skyrocketed to levels unseen in more than two decades.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Though anything can happen in the volatile world of oil trading, all signs point to a downturn that will be longer than many expected ? including state revenue estimators.</p>
<p>But state officials aren?t sweating. The phenomenon has undoubtedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/15/business/energy-environment/low-oil-prices-pose-threat-to-texas-fracking-bonanza.html?_r=0" type="external">walloped oil-dependent communities</a> in South and West Texas. But across the rest of the state,&amp;#160;other business&amp;#160;sectors are picking up the slack for an industry that no longer dominates the economy. And increases in production have kept oil and gas taxes flowing into Austin for now, even as prices drop.</p>
<p>?The comptroller does not want to diminish the impact that this has had on people?s communities and people?s lives,? said Chris Bryan, a spokesman for Comptroller <a href="" type="internal">Glenn Hegar</a>.</p>
<p>But statewide?&amp;#160;</p>
<p>?You?re still seeing job growth, you?re still seeing revenue growth in sales tax, you?re still seeing people moving here,? he said. ?And I think that is part of that story of Texas being not just an oil and gas state anymore.?</p>
<p>The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. <a href="" type="internal">Become one</a>.</p>
<p>Growth, but slower</p>
<p>The stats back up&amp;#160;the comptroller.&amp;#160;The state economy is growing, though more slowly than it did amid the drilling boom.</p>
<p>In March, the state lost 25,400 jobs, ending a remarkable streak of 53 months of growth, according to state and federal data. Yet Texas turned around and added 33,200 jobs in May, and <a href="http://www.twc.state.tx.us/files/news/press-release-082115-twc-texas-job-growth-continues-31400-jobs-added-july-twc.pdf" type="external">added more in each month since</a>.</p>
<p>Last June, the state collected less sales tax revenue than it did in June of 2014, <a href="" type="internal">ending a 62-month growth streak</a>. But in July, <a href="http://comptroller.texas.gov/taxinfo/salestax/" type="external">it edged out</a> collections from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Oil and mineral-related revenue makes up 10 percent of the state?s total tax collections but less than five percent of the Texas budget, according to state records.</p>
<p>?The revenue estimate is the sum of various parts, and what we?re seeing with oil and gas is, it?s not doing real well, but the other parts are doing very well,? said Dale Craymer, president of the business-backed Texas Taxpayers and Research Association and a former revenue estimator in the comptroller?s office.</p>
<p>Wrong guesses on oil revenue ? sort of</p>
<p>But in January, Hegar?s revenue estimate pegged taxable oil prices at between $65 and $75 per barrel through 2017. That?s far above where they are now, and far above where experts now expect them to linger, as supply stays high here and abroad and a mix of geopolitical factors ? including a diplomatic breakthrough that could unlock Iran?s supply ? threaten to keep it that way.</p>
<p>The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. <a href="" type="internal">Become one</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, the federal Energy Information Administration lowered its price forecasts for the coming years. The agency now <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=22572" type="external">predicts</a> that per-barrel prices will average $49 in 2015 and $54 the next year.</p>
<p>(Texas comptrollers are <a href="" type="internal">almost always wrong</a> on oil price predictions. ?There are two kinds of forecasters," said James LeBas, an economist with the Texas Oil and Gas Association and a former chief revenue estimator in the comptroller?s office. "There are those that don?t know ? no, there?s just one kind.?)</p>
<p>Does that portend budget trouble in Texas? &amp;#160;Not necessarily, the comptroller and other experts say. So far, oil tax revenue has come in around where Hegar predicted, largely because Texas operators are pumping more oil than expected.</p>
<p>Wells drilled today produce far more oil than the conventionally drilled wells of years past (though the output of those wells trails off more rapidly). Operators now drill multiple wells on one site, and the rigs themselves are&amp;#160;more efficient. Plummeting prices have only further driven operators to find new ways to eke out a profit margin.</p>
<p>Texas oil production was still rising through May, according to the most recent figures published by the state Railroad Commission, which regulates oil and gas.</p>
<p>?Today, we?re producing three times the oil we did 20 years ago,? Craymer said.&amp;#160; ?We?ve got low prices on a much higher production base than we?ve had historically, so that might give us a cushion as well.?</p>
<p>Still, experts forecast even more layoffs and declining investment in the coming months ? resulting in lower production ? as contracts that were signed before the prices tanked expire.</p>
<p>That means less spending on equipment and other goods in the oil patch, taking a bite out of state sales taxes.</p>
<p>?We have had a very healthy economy and that?s help delay the impact of falling oil prices, but I think we?re still going to see even slower growth ahead than what we are currently experiencing,? said Craymer.</p>
<p>Next steps</p>
<p>With that in mind, the comptroller's office is still keeping a close eye on oil prices, and has an opportunity to revise its forecasts in the coming months as it certifies its revenue estimate ? a process that takes into account the legislature?s most recent actions.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>?This is an opportunity to look at everything again,? said Bryan.</p>
<p>But even if that revision proves overly optimistic, the Texas budget may still escape trouble, because lawmakers left more <a href="" type="internal">$6.4 billion unspent</a> in the budget Gov. Greg Abbott signed in June. &amp;#160;</p>
<p>?The question is,? said LeBas, ?is the state going to stay in the black, and the answer there is yes.?&amp;#160;</p>

<article id="0000089" published-at="2013-08-13" title="Senator: Mexican Asylum Request ?Abuses? Taint Immigration Bill"><p><a href="" type="internal"></a>Accounts that U.S. border officials are facing a surge of Mexican immigrants claiming asylum by using a few key words prompted a top Republican senator to call for the pending immigration bill to be put on hold ?until these abuses are ended.?</p>
<p>Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., one of the most vocal critics of the comprehensive immigration overhaul being pushed on Capitol Hill, said the surge in asylum requests ?has exposed another grave flaw? in the implementation of federal immigration law.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/08/12/surge-mexican-illegal-immigrants-claiming-asylum-overwhelms-border-officials/" type="external">Documents obtained by Fox News show Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> has been paying for hotel rooms for dozens of recently arrived families to relieve overcrowding at processing centers in the San Diego area. Some ICE employees are working overtime and others have been asked to volunteer to work weekend shifts.</p>
<p>Sessions pointed to the wave of asylum requests in arguing that, while the Senate has already passed an immigration bill, the House should not proceed until the issue is addressed.</p>
<p>?The House cannot allow such actions to continue,? Sessions told FoxNews.com in a written statement. ?They must use every power they have to end this absurdity. No immigration bill should advance until these abuses are ended.?</p>
<p>Sessions, as well as the unions representing some immigration officials, have made similar arguments before about other alleged enforcement gaps ? like the practice of not deporting illegal immigrants accused of low-level offenses. They claim the bill, as drafted in the Senate, does not address these gaps.</p>
<p>Supporters of a comprehensive immigration bill claim it would be a boon for the country on several levels. President Obama, asked about the bill during his press conference last Friday, said the economy would be ?a trillion dollars stronger? if the bill is passed, allowing millions of illegal immigrants to apply for legal status and work on the books. He also pointed to boosted border security measures.</p>
<p>?We know that the Senate bill strengthens border security, puts unprecedented resources on top of the unprecedented resources I?ve already put into border security,? Obama said.</p>
<p>The president said that if the bill makes its way to the House floor, ?it would pass.? House leaders, though, have signaled interest in taking up a series of smaller bills instead.</p>
<p>The reports about a surge in asylum requests have raised new concerns, amid claims that illegal immigrants have learned they can attempt to get asylum by using a few key words ? namely, by claiming they have a ?credible fear? of drug cartels.</p>
<p>Julie Myers Wood, a former assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security under the George W. Bush administration, told Fox News the requests are ?suspicious.?</p>
<p>?While we welcome the U.S. being a place where refugees and (asylum seekers) can come, it?s troubling, and you have to think about asylum fraud in this instance,? she said.</p>
<p>She noted that claiming ?credible fear? is just a first step in the process. She said what?s ?concerning? is that if they are released from detention, ?maybe they won?t show up for their hearings? and go under the radar.</p>
<p>Myers Wood called for the administration to create a ?task force? to look at the possibility of asylum fraud.</p>
<p>?This clearly has to have been orchestrated by somebody,? said former U.S. Attorney for Southern California Peter Nunez. ?It?s beyond belief that dozens or hundreds or thousands of people would simultaneously decide that they should go to the U.S. and make this claim.?</p>
<p>Sources say one day last week, 200 border-crossers came through the Otay Mesa Port of Entry claiming asylum, while as many as 550 overflowed inside the processing center there and in nearby San Ysidro.</p>
<p>Fox News spoke to four agencies responsible for the San Diego situation last week. All deferred to the Department of Homeland Security press office in Washington, D.C., which issued this statement:</p>
<p>?Credible fear determinations are dictated by longstanding statute, not an issuance of discretion. The USCIS officer must find that a ?significant possibility? exists that the individual may be found eligible for asylum or withholding or removal.</p>
<p>?If the credible fear threshold is met, the individual is placed into removal proceedings in Immigration Court. The final decision on asylum eligibility rests with an immigration judge.?</p>
<p>A spokesman for Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., one of the leading Republican advocates for an immigration bill, said Tuesday that the administration?s ?failures to enforce immigration laws and the resulting distrust in the federal government? are among the biggest obstacles to passing a bill.</p>
<p>But spokesman Alex Conant said the Florida senator is hoping to use such a package to ?end the status quo of de facto amnesty.?</p></article>
<article id="0000092" published-at="2017-09-26" title="Letting California Secede and Stopping the Refugee Flood"><p></p>
<p>A trio of random thoughts?</p>
<p>The madness that is the state government in California has once again been made known to the residents of that state.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, May 10th of this year, the California Assembly passed a bill that would require all single-use restrooms in business, public and government establishments to become gender-neutral.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; AB 1732 requires all single-use restrooms in the establishments to be identified as ?all-gender toilet facilities.?&amp;#160;&amp;#160; A looney-tune member of the legislature, one Philip Ting, had this to say about the bill, ?California continues to move forward, be forward thinking ? think about how we can be more inclusive and frankly, more tolerant.&amp;#160; My hope is that we de-politicize the bathroom issue.?</p>
<p>If the bill became law, it would give the state the power to decide how individual business owners and public entities should best serve their customers.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; The gender inclusive restroom bill would inconvenience far more people than gender specific restrooms did.&amp;#160; Women, specifically would be inconvenienced.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Not many women would want to use a bathroom that had been used by men.&amp;#160; There are other, unintended consequences to this bill, if it becomes law.</p>
<p>As I understand it, a person just has to believe, or ?feel? that they are of a different gender that day and they can use the bathroom of the other gender.&amp;#160; Let?s carry this a step or two further.&amp;#160; How about boys showering with the girls in high school or college?&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Can a woman play on a man?s sports team simply because she feels like it that day?&amp;#160;&amp;#160; In my not-so-humble opinion, this whole transgender thing is nothing but trouble and the only ones that are going to profit in any way from it, will be trial lawyers.</p>
<p>The number of so-called ?refugees? in Europe makes the Police shake their heads.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; It was reported back in April that Police have uncovered a large and growing network of Islamic State fighters, at least two of whom came to Europe as ?refugees.?&amp;#160;&amp;#160; French and Belgian authorities have found that the scale of the threat of terrorism could be much bigger than they had previously thought. They?ve found that the members of these terror cells are mostly young Muslim men from the Brussels suburbs of Molenbeek and Schaerbeek and many were former criminals often involved with petty thefts and assaults.</p>
<p>Many of the attackers in Paris committed suicide and blew themselves up. One fled the scene of his crime and hid away with his cousin. He was killed in a police raid five days following the attack.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; After the attacks police had a major question: How large was the network that participated in the attacks and were there more sleeper cells in Europe waiting to strike?&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Many of these men are currently being sought by police, but unfortunately police often have no idea if they are in Europe or in Syria.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Their names, which cannot be verified, are assumed to be aliases as authorities are currently unsure of their true identities.</p>
<p>This next piece came to me from one of my readers and he asked me to pass it on, and I am.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; My Grandfather watched as his friends died in WWI.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; My Father watched as his friends died in WWII and Korea.&amp;#160; I watched (1st hand) as my friends fought and died in Vietnam.&amp;#160; I watched as our friends and children fought and died in Desert Storm.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; I watched and waited while our friends and children fought and died in Iraq.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; None of them fought for or died for the Mexican Flag or any other foreign flag?Everyone fought for and died for the U.S. Flag!</p>
<p>In Texas, a student raised a Mexican flag on a school flag pole; another student took it down.&amp;#160; Guess who was expelled.&amp;#160; The kid who took it down.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Kids in high school in California were sent home on Cinco de Mayo because they wore T-shirts with&amp;#160; the American flag printed on them. Enough is enough.</p>
<p>This message needs to be read by every American? and every American needs to stand up for America.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; We?ve bent over to appease the America-haters long enough.</p>
<p>I?m taking a stand.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; I?m standing up because the hundreds of thousands who died fighting in&amp;#160; wars for this country, and for the U.S. Flag, can?t stand up. And shame on anyone who tries to make this a racist message.</p>
<p>Let me make this perfectly clear!&amp;#160;&amp;#160; THIS IS MY COUNTRY!&amp;#160;&amp;#160; And, my making this statement DOES NOT mean I?m against immigration!&amp;#160;&amp;#160; YOU ARE WELCOME HERE IN OUR COUNTRY.&amp;#160; Welcome!&amp;#160;&amp;#160; To come through legally: 1.

Pay YOUR Taxes!&amp;#160; 6. Learn the&amp;#160; LANGUAGE like immigrants have in the past!&amp;#160;&amp;#160; 7.&amp;#160; Please don?t demand that we hand over our lifetime Savings of Social Security Funds to you.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; If you don?t want to forward this for fear of offending someone, then YOU?RE PART OF THE PROBLEM!&amp;#160;&amp;#160; When will AMERICANS STOP giving away THEIR&amp;#160; RIGHTS?&amp;#160;&amp;#160; We?ve gone so far the other way?we?ve bent over backwards not to offend anyone?But it seems no one cares about the AMERICAN CITIZEN being offended!&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Wake up America, your country needs you?desperately.</p>
<p>Parting shot: I think it?s an excellent idea for California to secede.&amp;#160; Most of the businesses there would probably relocate back into the United States anyhow.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Go ahead?secede or shut up.</p></article>
<article id="0000097" published-at="2016-04-20" title="The Democratic Party Now Belongs to Hillary Clinton"><p>For all intents and purposes, Hillary Clinton clinched the Democratic presidential nomination yesterday with a resounding double-digit win over Bernie Sanders in New York?s primary. From here on, the upcoming Democratic contests will have the air of a coronation procession for Clinton, and a death march for Sanders. The septuagenarian may continue to gripe about superdelegates, but his 280,000-vote loss in New York was a reminder that not everyone was feeling the Bern.</p>
<p>Up until now, Sanders drew <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/04/bernie-sanders-nyc-campaign-like-pitchfork-come-life" type="external">rock star crowds</a> as he raged against the machine. Two days before the primary, 28,000 people showed up in Brooklyn?s Prospect Park to watch the candidate and to listen to Grizzly Bear. The Wednesday before, a crowd of 27,000 filled Greenwich Village?s Washington Square Park for Sanders and Vampire Weekend. Who needed Coachella when you had Bernie, people asked.</p>
<p>But opening acts aren?t the same thing as organization, concerts aren?t elections, and grand gestures don?t necessarily make you a winner. As Clinton <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/4/19/11465336/hillary-clinton-speech-ny" type="external">pointed out</a> in her victory speech, ?it?s not enough to diagnose problems. You have to explain how you actually solve the problems.??Left unsaid was Clinton?s hand in making the messes she was complaining about. But never mind, Clinton clearly conveyed the message that Sanders was not ready for prime time.</p>
<p>In hindsight, Sanders? jetting to the Vatican just days before the primary looks like showboating, and his ill-prepared interview before the New York Daily News editorial board seems reminiscent of a stoner trying to ace a college biology exam. And Sanders paid for all of it.</p>
<p>On primary day, his appeal was limited to younger voters, single men, the very liberal, those with no religion, and rural New Yorkers?not exactly a winning coalition. In case anyone had forgotten, including Sanders himself, New York is not Vermont.</p>
<p>Clinton?s 16-point victory was impressive, as she came within a point of equaling her 2008 performance against Barack Obama in the New York Democratic primary, and this time it mattered. Clinton resoundingly won among men, women, and minorities, while battling to a draw among white voters. She had stitched together a viable coalition, and that?s what successful politicians do.</p>
<p>Yet, Sanders wasn?t the only casualty in the Democratic Primary. Yesterday marked the end of Clintonism, circa 1992; that is, the impulse to tack to the center while paying homage to law, order, and markets. To win, Clinton had to squirm away from the 1994 crime bill, and hoped the voters would forget about the fact that her husband?left the campaign trail in 1992 as Arkansas governor to preside over the execution of Ricky Ray Rector, a self-lobotomized cop killer.</p>
<p>The world had changed, and time had moved on. Instead of Bill trashing Sister Souljah, Hillary 2.0 paid homage to Rev. Al Sharpton, singing?the tax-dodging and race-baiting Reverend?s praises all with little hope of snagging his pre-primary endorsement. But then again, Clinton, unlike Sanders, always knew it was all about the ?W.? For Clinton, winning was everything.</p>
<p>The Jewish vote took a hit on Tuesday. According to the exit polls, Jews made up just 12 percent of the electorate. Religious ?nones? now outnumbered Jewish voters by more than two to one. To put things in perspective, just eight years earlier the Jews cast 17 percent of Democratic ballots, while in 1980 the figure was 38 percent. The three ?Is? of New York politics?Ireland, Israel and Italy?have been supplanted by hot sauce and Hamilton.</p>
<p>Policy-wise, Sanders chastised Israel and its prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and met with little open resistance. Even so, Israel continued to matter, as Sanders failed to pick up Manhattan?s Upper West Side while being decimated in Brooklyn?s heavily Jewish neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Starting today, Sanders will no longer be calling the shots. Sure, he may continue to clamor for Clinton to release her speech transcripts, but those calls will continue to fall on deaf ears. Likewise, Sanders will likely take aim at Clinton?s trustworthiness deficit, but in the upcoming Democratic contests, that will make little difference.</p>
<p>The reality is that Sanders?s campaign has run its?course, and it?s not just the Deep South that hasn?t gravitated toward him. Polls out of California, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania all show Clinton holding comfortable if not insurmountable leads.</p>
<p>Last night, it was clear that Clinton had November on her mind. She turned her gaze and her guns on Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, lambasting them for their positions on abortion, the minimum wage, Muslims, and immigration, with the knowledge that most Sanders supporters will be in her corner come November. Susan Sarandon aside, Clinton is not hated by her own party, and that?s a very big deal.</p>
<p>According to the exit polls, 85 percent of New York Democrats said that they were prepared to vote for Clinton in the fall, and two-thirds indicated that they were either excited or optimistic about her being the Democratic standard bearer. In comparison, the Republican numbers looked like a prelude to civil war, a funeral, or all of the above.</p>
<p>Nearly a quarter of Republicans announced that they would not vote for Trump, while more than 40 percent said the same thing about Cruz. Meanwhile, a staggering 59 percent of New York Republicans said they were scared or concerned by the prospect of a Cruz candidacy. In other words, whoever emerges as the Republican nominee will have a tough road to travel.</p>
<p>To be sure, Clinton?s election is by no means inevitable. Most Americans find her dishonest, and she?s almost as unpopular with the public as Cruz. As for her oratory, Clinton?s speeches sound like a laundry list, and her listening audience often looks like it would rather be somewhere else. Passion and trust are not exactly her hallmark. But with Democrats coalescing behind her, and the Republicans poised for a bloodbath, Clinton remains the one to beat.</p>

<p>Americans seemed relieved that Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis had chosen Arlington as her final resting place. She was still in her early 30s when husband was murdered, with small children, and she?d married another man who had the wealth and wherewithal to shield them. When she died at age 64, Jackie, had another companion, but the grassy hill overlooking the capital is where her countrymen thought she belonged.</p>
<p>?It seems appropriate and somehow right that she and Jack will be together again,? a cemetery visitor named Jeanette Freeman of Lumberton, N.C., told a reporter 20 years ago today. ?That's just where she should be.?</p>
<p>The same day, May 21, 1994, President Clinton mentioned Jackie in his weekly radio address.</p>
<p>"She inspired all of us with her grace and courage,? Clinton said. ?She loved art and culture -- all the things that express the better angels of our nature. She and President Kennedy made people believe that change for the better is possible, that public service is a noble calling, and that we ought to be about the business of building our country up, not tearing it down or pulling it apart.?</p>
<p>That love of art and culture that Clinton mentioned was no small thing.</p>
<p>Until Jackie came along -- and, really, for years afterward -- first ladies tended to be put into one of two pigeonholes: they were either like Dolley Madison, fashionable, vivacious, gracious?but glorified emcees, really. Or they were driven policy mavens such as Eleanor Roosevelt.</p>
<p>This was never the right way to look at it. Almost all of the first ladies were presidential advisers as well as White House hostesses. Dolley Madison was also a forceful wartime first lady. And Edith Wilson, not Eleanor Roosevelt (nor Hillary Clinton) was the first to be derided as ?Mrs. President.?</p>
<p>Jacqueline Kennedy was considered the pinnacle of fashion, and her self-selected issue -- refurbishing the White House -- seemed safe enough. But her vision went much further, and popularized the historic preservation movement in this country. In addition, Jackie wanted a Cabinet-level post for the arts. This idea, in time, became the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Michelle Obama delivered the president?s weekly Saturday radio address, one in which she expressed outrage over the mass kidnapping of Nigerian schoolgirls. It was Mrs. Obama?s first solo radio address, but the fact that she was giving it was taken in stride, as White House observers are finally getting it: first ladies don?t have to be one way or the other.</p>

<article id="0000125" published-at="2012-10-12" title="How Does a Traditionalist Vote?"><p>I?ve said on Facebook that I?m tempted to cut out the middleman this November and write in a vote for Goldman Sachs. But if you?re a traditionalist conservative and you want to accept one of the offerings officially on your ballot, which do you choose?</p>
<p>For partisans, this is a no-brainer. For conservatives in the vein of, say, Russell Kirk, it?s anything but. Faced with the non-choice between Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Thomas Dewey in 1944, Kirk said no to empire and <a href="http://users.etown.edu/m/mcdonaldw/Kirkbc.htm" type="external">voted for Norman Thomas</a>, the Socialist Party candidate. There was no Fox News to tell him a conservative couldn?t do that.</p>
<p>For all that Kirk didn?t like libertarians ? ? <a href="http://www.firstprinciplesjournal.com/articles.aspx?article=1476&amp;amp;loc=fs" type="external">chirping sectaries</a>,? he called them ? if he were in search of a peace candidate today he might well consider the Libertarian Party?s Gary Johnson. Or, closer to Norman Thomas, the Green Party?s Jill Stein.</p>
<p>There?s even an anti-empire case ? not a strong one, but one outlined by Justin Raimondo <a href="http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2012/09/30/race-for-the-white-house-2012-whom-to-root-for/" type="external">here</a> ? for Barack Obama. The incumbent is at least incrementally better than his Republican rival on foreign policy. It?s impossible to imagine Romney not having done every bellicose thing that Obama that did in his first term (from ramping up the drone war in Pakistan to participating in the Libya attack), and Romney has promised a great deal more: more brinksmanship with Iran, more baiting of Russian bears and Chinese dragons, more taxpayer dollars for Pentagon pork. For a smaller military budget and the prospect of fewer wars ? according to both candidates themselves ? a pragmatic anti-empire conservative might lean toward Obama.</p>
<p>A traditionalist who prioritizes the Supreme Court and the possibility of eventually overturning Roe v. Wade will lean the other way. Romney may or may not appoint reliably right-wing justices, but Obama would invariably appoint more justices like Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Just as there?s a chance of less war with Obama, there?s a chance of ending Roe ? or moving in that direction ? with Romney. Weigh the prospects.</p>
<p>Economically speaking, both major-party candidates are prisoners of outmoded ideologies. Obama, a Keynesian without gusto, has been remarkably short on proposals for reviving the economy: he offers just more of the same. Romney pins his hopes to ?growth? stimulated by low taxes and lower interest rates, a recipe that notably failed to cook up a solution to the impending crisis during the Bush years.?Where the economy is concerned, Obama has had basically nothing?to say, and nothing Romney says can be trusted.</p>
<p>If immigration is your top concern, Romney again is clearly better than Obama, but may not be nearly good enough. For a symbolic restrictionist vote, there?s former Virginia congressman Virgil Goode on the Constitution Party ticket. Goode <a href="" type="internal">voted for the Iraq War and the Patriot Act</a> (twice), so he?s no Pat Buchanan or Ron Paul. But he?s certainly a restrictionist?s restrictionist.</p>
<p>Then there?s Gary Johnson, the highest elected official ever to run on the Libertarian Party ticket, a two-term and quite successful governor of New Mexico. He?s a libertarian, not a traditionalist conservative, but he shares a traditionalist?s distaste for Wilsonian wars ? though he gets <a href="" type="internal">intermittently squishy</a> on humanitarian intervention. If ever the Libertarian Party seemed like a good idea, an experienced government-slashing governor running against the politicians who brought you Romneycare and Obamacare ? the guy who promised to ?double Guantanamo? and the guy who promised to close it but didn?t ? would seem to be worth considering.</p>
<p>None of these contenders is a conservative in the traditionalist?s understanding of the world. Romney is a warhawk who belongs to the class of false conservatives that Robert Nisbet <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KZm6dtSY_lQC&amp;amp;pg=PA111&amp;amp;lpg=PA111&amp;amp;dq=Budget-expanding+enthusiasts+for+giant+increases+in+military+expenditures&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=e-0ULDR3so&amp;amp;sig=61o2q-odbZfRDulfjpvOm0uoZpM&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=BKJ3UM-3BsiL0QGnhYHoBQ&amp;amp;sqi=2&amp;amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Budget-expanding%20enthusiasts%20for%20giant%20increases%20in%20military%20expenditures&amp;amp;f=false" type="external">described</a> in Conservatism: Dream and Reality as ?Budget-expanding enthusiasts for giant increases in military expenditures,? but he <a href="http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2012/10/09/romney-says-abortion-legislation-isnt-part-of-his-agenda" type="external">might</a> be antiabortion. Obama is less overtly hawkish but terrible on abortion and religious liberty. Gary Johnson is a libertarian, and Virgil Goode is Tom Tancredo.</p>
<p>There are two meta-considerations for a traditionalist. If Romney wins, he?ll have a Republican House and probably a Democratic Senate, which sounds exactly like the formula that gave us No Child Left Behind in the Bush years. (Once Bush?s party took the Senate, too, we got the Iraq War and Medicare Part D.) Obama would have a Republican House and probably a Democratic Senate, the formula that gave us <a href="" type="internal">the sequester</a> and a far cry from the Democratic dominance that gave us the Affordable Care Act. Single-party control of the House and the executive branch has not, historically, been a path to smaller government. If Romney wants conservatives to buy what he?s selling here, he has to convince them of his own kind of ?hope? and ?change.?</p>
<p>The other thing to keep in mind is the long view: a Republican president means a greater likelihood of Democratic gains the House in 2014. A second Obama term means a good chance of a Republican picking up the White House in 2016, by which time someone much better than Romney might be on the ballot ? or perhaps someone much worse. Once more, it?s a question of weighing the probabilities.</p>
<p>Then again, one could always do exactly what Russell Kirk did, and poke both Goldman Sachs and the empire lovers in the eye by writing in Norman Thomas.</p>

<article id="0000127" published-at="2017-04-29" title="Beyonc??s gorgeous pregnancy has a powerful subtext for health"><p><a href="" type="internal">Beyonc?</a> is on a quest to change how the world sees pregnancy. Along the way, she?s nudging us to consider the biases pregnant black women face, and the startling gap between black and white women when it comes to maternal health.</p>
<p>On the first day of Black History Month, <a href="" type="internal">the performer revealed she was pregnant</a> with twins ? looking like a goddess against a backdrop of hearts and flowers in an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BP-rXUGBPJa/" type="external">Instagram</a> photo that evoked Virgin Mary imagery.</p>
<p>Since then, she?s posted dozens of photos on social media and her website, looking <a href="http://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/beyonce-fat-shamed-130707/photos/beyonce-s-baby-bump-241146" type="external">lush and glam</a>with her swelling belly. She even performed on the <a href="" type="internal">Grammys stage</a> in a golden bikini and halo.</p>
<p>For these public appearances, Beyonc? has been winning plaudits from cultural commenters, who say she?s ? <a href="https://www.romper.com/p/beyonces-latest-hairstyle-makes-a-powerful-statement-for-black-moms-52238" type="external">normalizing</a> the beauty of black motherhood,? as Kelly Glass <a href="https://www.romper.com/p/beyonces-latest-hairstyle-makes-a-powerful-statement-for-black-moms-52238" type="external">wrote</a> in a powerful essay for Romper.</p>
<p>She?s also countering <a href="http://theconversation.com/how-beyonce-pregnancy-pics-challenge-racist-religious-and-sexual-stereotypes-72429" type="external">centuries of bias against</a> black women in a culture that associates black women with ?primitivity or wild sexuality? and whiteness with purity, noted the University of Sheffield?s <a href="http://theconversation.com/profiles/katie-edwards-111340" type="external">Katie Edwards</a>.</p>
<p>This matters because the marginalization of black pregnancy in our culture has also translated to its marginalization in our health system, with life-or-death consequences for moms and babies.</p>
<p>Put simply, black mothers and their babies generally fare much more poorly than white women and their babies, in what?s been called a <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/whats-killing-americas-black-infants/" type="external">?national health crisis fueled by racism.</a>?</p>
<p>Black mothers have long been more likely to <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/ourstories/mchb75th/mchb75maternalmortality.pdf" type="external">die from pregnancy-related complications</a> compared with white women.</p>
<p>Black women <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18381544" type="external">are also more likely</a> than white women to deliver babies prematurely ? with devastating consequences. Preterm delivery (at less than 37 weeks) is one of the key causes of infant death in the US, and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db74.pdf" type="external">black infants die at more than twice the rate of white infants</a>. Among the infants who survive, early births can lead to a host of health complications, from vision and hearing impairment to cerebral palsy.</p>
<p>When it comes to nursing, black moms are typically less likely to breastfeed, which has been explained by everything from <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/108/2/291.short" type="external">preference</a> to a lack of access and <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-27744391" type="external">education</a> about health benefits to the lack of <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/86/5/741.short" type="external">support</a> for new moms. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6333a2.htm?s_cid=mm6333a2_w" type="external">showed</a> that hospitals in predominantly black neighborhoods also do less to promote breastfeeding than mostly white hospitals.</p>
<p>Of course <a href="" type="internal">Beyonc?</a> won?t fix these longstanding health problems. But she?s helping to affirm that pregnancy is something to celebrate, and that maternal health is something to guard. And she deserves credit for doing that, one gorgeous portrait at a time.</p></article>

<p>She needs an approach that is both broader and more radical: giving all Americans, men and women alike, more control over when they participate and don?t participate in the labor force.???We should be working towards a society where men and women can negotiate with one another, with equal resources to pick their own version of the good life. And so that when they have to compromise that ideal, they can do so on their own terms.</p>
<p>Whether women are working less or working more is the wrong question to ask. Rather, ask if they?re doing what they want to do, or what society and the economy demand they do.</p>
<p>It?s interesting that we live in a time when society?(or certain political groups within society) is single-mindedly focused on driving women into the workforce, <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/2012/04/13/women-work-and-motherhood/" type="external">seeing full-time work?as a superior lifestyle</a> for mothers. Contrast this with?a piece also published yesterday, in which Wednesday Martin <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/07/the-captivity-of-motherhood/398525/" type="external">considers</a> the ?captivity of motherhood? experienced?by women?in the 1960s:</p>
<p>Johnson was groping toward feminism?s second wave before it came to be, feeling for a toehold. She listed, in her catalogue not of grievances so much as unsentimental facts about the lives of herself and her conspecifics, the following: isolation, worries about illness and money, and sexual boredom. She referred to the whole schmear as ?the housewife?s syndrome, the vicious circle, the feeling of emptiness in the gap between what she thought marriage was going to be like and what it really is like.?</p>
<p>? A participant-observer in the bizarre social reality she describes, Johnson conveys without rancor the existentially isolated, restless feeling that my mother?s generation grappled with, and that Friedan wrote about when she quoted one of her subjects: ?I?m a server of food and a putter-on of pants and a bed-maker, somebody who can be called on when you want something. But who am I??</p>
<p>And Johnson might have added, ?Why am I the only one?? Johnson starts off with the demographically inflected observation that women are cut off from their extended families and friends by the idealized nuclear family, with its ostensibly perfect evenings of popcorn and TV in PJs, but moves toward darker realities, including the impact of this existence on female consciousness.</p>
<p>This latter paragraph?illustrates the?geographical and urban components of Johnson?s problem: compare the isolation?described above?with this account <a href="" type="internal">from Benjamin Schwarz</a>?of working-class motherhood amongst working-class families in London?up until the late 1950s:</p>
<p>?Working-class life was defined by an idiosyncratic approach to what is ?always one of the great and indispensible functions of any society,? as Willmott and Young put it: the task of caring for children. That approach emerged from the distinctive relationship of the working-class mother?the sainted, mythic figure known as ?Mum??to her married daughters, a relationship that had developed from a universal truth: ?Child-rearing,? Willmott and Young wrote in a deceptively obvious observation, ?is arduous, it is puzzling, it is monotonous?? But a daughter?s ?work can be less arduous because it is shared; her life less lonely because she has someone to talk to; the behavior of her children less perplexing because she has someone whose experience she can draw on.?</p>
<p>For a married working-class daughter whose husband was at work, her Mum was ?the person with whom she can share the mysteries as well as the tribulations, the burdens as well as the satisfactions, of childbirth and motherhood.?</p>
<p>The result was a flourishing matriarchy, in which a woman?s authority and stature grew with age and in which?thanks to the proximity of employment for the menfolk and the geographically compressed layout of working-class districts?the households of Mum and of her married daughters? families were, and in fact had to be, nearly always at most a few blocks away and often on the same street. (In a 1956 study of a Liverpool neighborhood, the sociologist Charles Verker revealed a not-atypical arrangement in which the households of one extended family?mother, daughter, father-in-law, sister-in-law, uncle, three cousins?occupied eight of the 22 houses of a short street.)</p>
<p>Children were raised as much in Mum?s house as in their own; married daughters would see their sisters and their sisters? children at Mum?s, usually daily; their husbands would regularly have their supper after work at Mum?s; family ?popping in? for a cup of tea and a chat was the norm?Mum and her daughters saw each other on as many as a dozen separate visits each day. The sons-in-law who gathered at Mum?s were usually drinking friends, and the friends and workmates of each became part of the others? vast network of acquaintances.</p>
<p>In this world, Willmott and Young explained, in which daughters turned to Mum ?in the great personal crises and on the small domestic occasions,? daughters and mothers would ?share so much and give such help to each other because, in their women?s world, they have the same functions of caring for home and bringing up children.?</p>
<p>Separate clusters of extended families formed the working-class neighborhood. Its residents knew each other with an intimacy of detail and often through several points of connection?the people a young mother encountered while doing her marketing were her or her parents? childhood playmates and the friends and relatives of her husband or her brothers- and sisters-in-law. Characterized by these informal, intimate, multilayered social networks, and by what Willmott and Young called ?a sociable squash of people and houses, workshops and lorries??in which the local pub was at the end of the block, the store for daily provisions around the corner, and a destination five minutes? walk away was considered in a different neighborhood entirely?this was a largely static, tremendously local, intensely parochial realm.</p>
<p>This strikes a remarkable contrast to the suburban housewives described by Martin, ?cut off from their extended families and friends by the idealized nuclear family.?</p>
<p>And the problem persists today?Martin says that even the ?privileged mommies? she?s met are most often ?cut off from extended families,? and thus ?depend at least in part on nannies to help them with the heavy lifting of motherhood.??The disintegration of the?home economy and its corresponding networks of support has developed steadily throughout time, and it?s had consequences for mothers.</p>
<p>When we talk about the plight of the 1960s housewife, we don?t talk enough?about?the role the rise of the suburbs?and increasing familial atomization?may have played in her isolation. Cut off from?the rapport and community infrastructure Schwarz describes in his article, she was increasingly?alone. Housework, child care, cooking, and cleaning responsibilities fell squarely on her shoulders?without any of the corresponding social or familial supports that may have alleviated those burdens.</p>
<p>Yet as our society industrialized and urbanized, women came to recognize their feelings of loneliness and isolation as an economic / inequality problem. While that may not be entirely false, there were other social, cultural, and geographic?dilemmas involved. And without fixing those, the problem has continued to simmer?beneath the surface.</p>
<p>Why? Because not all women have found contentment within the workforce, within a 9-to-5 job. Martin suggests that a lot of this discontent comes from a still-rigid set of options available to women:?a lack of institutional flexibility, coupled with a lack of benefits, that make it difficult for a woman to ?have it all? (job plus kids). Spross, too, despite his welcome acknowledgement that women should be able to choose their venue of work, be it in or outside the traditional workforce, continues to look to economic or career-related?policies?to salvage and assuage the problem. This understanding continues to reinforce the idea that SAHM?s loneliness or search for meaning can be fixed with?economic band-aids. This?makes no sense, when you consider the fact that this is an entirely narrow and fractured understanding of the human person, whose?nature is decidedly social, relational, intellectual, and emotional, as well as vocational.</p>
<p>Last week, I talked to Joel Salatin, <a href="http://www.polyfacefarms.com/" type="external">sustainable farmer and author</a>, about the interns who come to his farm. He noted?that several of them are coming from white-collar desk jobs: one current intern worked 10 years as an engineer for a Fortune 500 company.?He?got tired of computers and cubicles, Salatin?said. ?Our trajectory of institutional schooling, to student loans and college, to a white collar job keeps people from discovering other passions,? he said.??Lots of our interns were burned out by white collar careers. They tell me, ?I always wanted to do this, but I was told I couldn?t.'?</p>
<p>While increased flexibility and benefits for women are of course beneficial and important, they overlook the other problem we face: that of a culture whose fabric has become increasingly rigid and atomized, in which women?are separated from the familial, communal, and institutional supports that could help give them?a sense of meaning and purpose. It?s a culture that gives smart, talented women one trajectory for their gifts, and tells them other pathways are a ?waste,? or a sure-fire road to loneliness and dejection.</p>
<p>But if there?s one thing I?ve learned from the stay-at-home moms, homeschoolers, and retired ladies who I met growing up, it?s that everything is a matter of perspective, location, and relationship. What are you doing with your time? Are you living in a place that increases or decreases your ability to connect in a meaningful way? Are you reaching out to others, building an infrastructure of community and camaraderie around your family?</p>
<p>These questions?may not be sufficient to assuage all the problems or inner conflicts that a mother?faces?but they?present a more holistic solution to her problem than the purely career-centric focus that modern society most often presents?her with.</p></article>
<article id="0000130" published-at="2017-04-14" title="White House greenlights a new immigration-detention center in Texas"><p>A private-prison company that has for years been in the crosshairs of immigrant rights groups announced Thursday it will build a $110 million detention complex in the Houston metro area.</p>
<p>The Florida-based GEO Group said in a news release its new facility will be built in the city of Conroe as part of a 10-year, renewable contract with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The detention center will be finished toward the end of 2018, the company said. The Associated Press first <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_IMMIGRATION_DETENTION_TEXAS?SITE=AP&amp;amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;amp;CTIME=2017-04-13-22-05-24" type="external">reported</a> the story.</p>
<p>?We are very appreciative of the continued confidence placed in our company by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,? George C. Zoley, GEO?s chairman and CEO said in a statement. The company expects the new facility to generate the firm about $44 million in yearly revenue.</p>
<p>Immigrant advocacy groups said the move signals the beginning of President Trump?s efforts to expand detentions and begin fast-tracking the deportations of millions of undocumented immigrants in the country. Part of the president's Jan. 25 executive order on immigration <a href="" type="internal">instructed</a> the Department of Homeland Security to increase bed space for undocumented immigrants subject to removal.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. <a href="" type="internal">Become one</a>.</p>
<p>?We?re not surprised, but we are deeply disappointed that the administration is not only lining the pockets of the private-prison industry but expanding detention,? said Bob Libal, the executive director for Grassroots Leadership, an Austin-based immigrant rights and private-prison watchdog group.</p>
<p>Neither the Conroe mayor's office nor the city secretary?s office immediately responded to an email seeking comment on the announcement Friday, and officials with those offices were not reachable by phone.</p>
<p>The new facility will add to the GEO Group?s heavy presence in Texas. The company?s website lists more than a dozen facilities it operates in the state. They range from smaller local jails used mainly by the U.S. Marshals Service to larger immigration-detention complexes near the border.</p>
<p>GEO Group was involved in a lengthy <a href="" type="internal">legal battle</a> last year after Grassroots Leadership filed a lawsuit to prevent the company?s Karnes City facility from being licensed as a child-care facility by state officials. The center houses hundreds of women and children that were part of the surge of undocumented immigrants from Central America who began arriving to Texas in record numbers four years ago.</p>
<p>The child-care facility licensing has been necessary since 2015, when U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee&amp;#160;ordered that immigrants held in Texas and elsewhere should be released because their detention violates the provisions of a 1997 settlement ? the&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.aclu.org/files/pdfs/immigrants/flores_v_meese_agreement.pdf" type="external">Flores v. Meese</a>&amp;#160;agreement ? that requires undocumented&amp;#160;juveniles be&amp;#160;held in facilities that protect their health and safety.</p>
<p>A state district judge denied the state the ability to issue the licenses, but the facility continues to operate as a temporary processing center, Libal said.</p></article>
<article id="0000141" published-at="2008-11-07" title="Prop. 8 foes concede defeat, vow to fight on"><p>Caption</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>Opponents of <a href="" type="internal">Proposition</a> 8 conceded defeat Thursday in their campaign to block the ban on same-sex marriage in California, pinning their hopes on a legal challenge to the statewide initiative.</p>
<p>The estimated 3 million votes yet to be counted across the state are not enough to close the 500,000-vote, 52.5 percent to 47.5 percent lead the "Yes" side now holds, officials from the No on 8 campaign said.</p>
<p>"While we think the margin will close, we are convinced we will not be able to overcome the small deficit we are in and that <a href="" type="internal">Proposition 8</a> will pass," <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Geoff+Kors%22" type="external">Geoff Kors</a>, executive director of Equality California, said in a telephone news conference.</p>
<p>But attorneys for several gay rights groups have challenged the Prop. 8 victory, filing legal papers calling on the state <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Supreme+Court%22" type="external">Supreme Court</a> to reject the same-sex marriage ban as an overreaching use of the public's initiative power.</p>
<p>"Proposition 8 is a very radical and dangerous change to the principles of the California Constitution," said <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Shannon+Minter%22" type="external">Shannon Minter</a>, legal director of the <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22National+Center+for+Lesbian+Rights%22" type="external">National Center for Lesbian Rights</a>. "Never before has an existing fundamental right been taken away."</p>
<p>Supporters of Prop. 8 suggested that the opponents were little more than sore losers making a desperate attempt to overturn their loss on election day.</p>
<p>"They may recognize that they lost the election, but it's clear they don't have any respect for the will of the people of California," said <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Frank+Schubert%22" type="external">Frank Schubert</a>, political consultant for the Prop. 8 effort. "We're very confident that the Supreme Court will uphold the people's rights in this case."</p>
<p>Kors and other opponents of the measure also complained about what they considered to be false statements and questionable tactics by the Prop. 8 campaign and predicted victory for the rights of same-sex couples in the future.</p>
<p>"That day is not today and it may not be tomorrow, but I do not believe it is far off," said <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Kate+Kendell%22" type="external">Kate Kendell</a>, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights.</p>
<p>Kors said Prop. 8 opponents have not decided whether to go to the ballot to overturn the same-sex marriage ban.</p>
<p>"We'll see what happens as the legal fight moves forward and make our decisions then," he said.</p>
<p>Prop. 8 supporters won a surprisingly widespread victory Tuesday, winning in 42 of the state's 58 counties. The only counties voting down the measure were in a line along the coast and San Francisco Bay from Humboldt south to <a href="" type="internal">Monterey</a>, along with Santa Barbara, Yolo, Mono and tiny Alpine. Solano County was the only Bay Area county to back Prop. 8.</p>
<p>The state's five largest counties, all in Southern California, voted in favor of Prop. 8. San Francisco, not surprisingly, had the strongest "No on Prop. 8" showing, with 76.5 percent of the voters opposed. Tulare County was the biggest backer of the initiative, with 75.4 percent of its voters in favor.</p>

<article id="0000144" published-at="2017-08-21" title="Behind the unlikely success of PolitiFact and the Truth-O-Meter"><p>There were lots of good reasons we shouldn?t have started PolitiFact.</p>
<p>We were out of our league. The St. Petersburg Times was a regional paper with a good reputation, but we didn?t know much about fact-checking or developing new products in a digital age.</p>
<p>I knew nothing about building a website. My first diagram of the site was a poster board with pasted stories and arrows drawn with a Sharpie.</p>
<p>We couldn?t afford it. It was 2007, and the newspaper business had begun its painful contraction. The predicament was even worse for Florida papers like the Times because the housing crash and the decline in advertising were already underway. With revenue shrinking, the new fact-checking site would steal resources from everyday obligations.</p>
<p>Also, we were wading into a new type of journalism that exposed us to the bare-knuckled partisanship of American politics. We were sure to anger both sides of the political spectrum.</p>
<p>And yet we still built it.</p>
<p>Ten years later, PolitiFact is going strong. It won a Pulitzer Prize in 2009 and became a well-known brand in American journalism. In an age of ?alternative facts,? when politicians routinely repeat falsehoods, its work is more important than ever.</p>
<p>You probably know the site for its fact-checks on national politicians and pundits, but there also are PolitiFact partners in 11 states that check claims by governors, state legislators, and members of Congress. Together the state and national sites have checked more than 13,000 statements.</p>
<p>Molly Adair, a graphic artist and Bill Adair?s daughter, drew her impressions of what the patent drawings would have looked like had PolitiFact patented an actual Truth-O-Meter.</p>
<p>PolitiFact helped inspire a fact-checking movement around the world and pioneered a new way of tracking campaign promises. Presidential candidates and other politicians have worried aloud about ?being PolitiFacted.? The website and its Truth-O-Meter have even seeped into pop culture, with mentions on Jeopardy!, The Daily Show, and the New York Times crossword puzzle.</p>
<p>Looking back, it?s pretty remarkable that the site survived. I doubt any news organization in America other than the Tampa Bay Times, as the paper is now known, would have stuck with it so long.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>THE IDEA FOR POLITIFACT grew out of my guilt as a Washington reporter. I?d covered Congress and the White House for a decade and, like other reporters, had included political talking points in my stories without verifying whether they were true. In the spring of 2007, I decided to ask my editors if I could start a fact-checking site for the 2008 campaign.</p>
<p>I sketched an idea for the homepage on a Microsoft Word document. Titled ?The Campaign Referee,? it featured the ?Truth-o-Meter,? which rated statements ?True,? ?Kinda true,? ?Half True? and ?Wrong.?</p>
<p>That approach was pretty radical back then. Political journalists preferred the comfort of on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand journalism to calling out falsehoods. FactCheck.org, a project the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, launched in 2003 and was a pioneer of fact-checking. But the site didn?t use a rating system and did not keep score of how candidates fared. I thought we could build a better mousetrap. We could make fact-checking more accessible to a larger audience by rating claims on a Truth-O-Meter and tallying candidates? records.</p>
<p>The editors were unanimous about the importance of fact-checking as a public service.</p>
<p>I took the poster to a meeting in St. Pete and made my pitch to a group of editors. They were generally quite supportive even though PolitiFact was sure to drain resources from the paper?s usual coverage of a presidential campaign. Neil Brown, the editor of the Times, and Scott Montgomery, the paper?s government and politics editor, gave me a few weeks to write some prototype fact-checks.</p>
<p>We brought in Matt Waite, a reporter who had done lots of data journalism, to build the website. He incorporated the ideas of Adrian Holovaty, a visionary web developer who believed that journalism should be structured like a database so readers could interact with it.</p>
<p>A key part of our success was we were freed from our daily obligations. I essentially stopped being the paper?s Washington bureau chief and focused full time on PolitiFact. Our launch team had tremendous autonomy. We were like a band of pirates that could try new things and challenge the company?s usual way of doing things.</p>
<p>We realized it wasn?t practical to put PolitiFact on the newspaper?s web publishing system, so Waite built ours from scratch. That early decision ensured PolitiFact had a distinctive and flexible structure that enabled us to add state editions and the Obameter, our campaign promise tracker.</p>
<p>We brought together some of the most creative people at the Times to suggest names and help design the site. Kevin McGeever, a web editor, suggested we include a rating of ?Pants on Fire,? a phrase so good it?s become synonymous with PolitiFact. We also got early help from reporters at our sister publication Congressional Quarterly, who provided expertise about Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>Why was the Times willing to make such a bold step? Part of it was the paper?s ambitions. It?s a regional paper that has always sought to play on the national stage. Also, the editors were unanimous about the importance of fact-checking as a public service.</p>
<p>?We are true believers in journalism as an instrument of democracy,? Brown wrote when PolitiFact launched. ?Even as we seek to reach customers in new ways, we see our primary obligation as helping citizens participate fully in the democratic process.?</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>The PolitiFact music video.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>It also helped that the owner of the Times is the Poynter Institute, a journalism education center. That reduces the pressure for the newspaper to make big profits.</p>
<p>The editors believed in fact-checking so much that they were willing to prioritize the work, even though it meant sacrificing much of the political reporting the Times?s Washington bureau traditionally published, especially during election years.</p>
<p>Still, we weren?t sure how long PolitiFact could last. Although Brown?s 2007 column mentioned our hope of expanding the fact-checking to state and local politicians, we also had a contingency plan. If the site was a flop, we were going to shut down in six months.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>THE FIRST FEW WEEKS went well. We got <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/2007/08/we-have-company/" type="external">a warm welcome</a> from Brooks Jackson at FactCheck.org, who generously emailed his readers to encourage them to check us out. ?So far we like what we?ve seen,? he wrote six days after we launched. ?The writing is crisp and clear, sources are clearly cited with hyperlinks where appropriate, and the Web site is nicely organized.?</p>
<p>Jackson wasn?t keen on the Truth-O-Meter, though. ?We tend to leave ?truth? to theologians and philosophers,? he wrote. But he said, ?We admire (PoltiiFact?s) panache.?</p>
<p>Jackson?s welcome provided a nice surge in traffic that inflated our expectations. But traffic soon settled down to just a few thousand page views on a typical day. It was so weak that I mused about whether I could help by repeatedly clicking the site from my home computer.</p>
<p>Still, the Truth-O-Meter was a hit. Jackson and <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/readers/index.ssf/2014/01/coming_truth_squad_reporting_w.html" type="external">other</a> <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2012/09/politifacts_faux_fact_checking.html" type="external">critics</a> have called it a gimmick?and they?re right. But it?s an extremely effective gimmick. It?s a concise and memorable way to summarize our conclusions. Every Truth-O-Meter rating is based on in-depth research and a thorough process.</p>
<p>Fact-checkers around the world have copied our approach. About three-fourths of them use meters, true-false ratings, or a similar system. The Truth-O-Meter, which we?ve trademarked, is the most recognizable feature of PolitiFact. A lady once came up to me at an airport because she recognized me from TV appearances. She said, ?You?re the Truth-O-Meter guy!?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>IT WASN?T UNTIL 2009 that I began to worry about money.</p>
<p>The decision to continue after the 2008 election wasn?t even a close call. By then, the site was so well known and widely praised that Brown was willing to let us keep going even though the national economy was in the depths of the recession and the Times and other news organizations were making lots of painful cutbacks.</p>
<p>We continued our fact-checking by focusing on members of Congress and the occasional pundit. We also added a new feature to track 500 of President Obama?s campaign promises. We presented them using a distinctive PolitiFact approach, rating the president?s progress using a six-point scale we called the <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/" type="external">Obameter</a>.</p>
<p>In the first two years, PolitiFact hadn?t generated much ad revenue. The big reason was our low web traffic, which didn?t provide enough ?impressions? to interest most advertisers. And the sales department at the Times and our partner Congressional Quarterly had not put much energy into finding groups that might buy ads or pay for sponsorships.</p>
<p>I got concerned that the Times would pull the plug if I didn?t start bringing in some money. Brown had never mentioned that or even hinted that it was necessary, but I knew it would be impossible to sustain our staff of three full-time journalists plus a couple of editors working part time.</p>
<p>About this time, PolitiFact was honored with the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting, which led to a few calls from newspapers that that were interested in starting state sites. I drew up a plan about how we could license the Truth-O-Meter to newspapers for state and local fact-checking. It seemed like a good way to make some money and keep our venture going.</p>
<p>We had hired a consultant to write a business plan for PolitiFact. But he discouraged us from starting state partnerships. He said the&amp;#160;Times&amp;#160;had little experience running that type of business, and it would be more trouble than it was worth.</p>
<p>At the same time, we had hired a consultant to write a business plan for PolitiFact. But he discouraged us from starting state partnerships. He said the Times had little experience running that type of business, and it would be more trouble than it was worth.</p>
<p>We did it anyway. We figured we could establish procedures to ensure quality control (I modeled them after the training and practices used by Subway and McDonald?s) and, most importantly, the state editions allowed us to spread our fact-checking around the nation. Our early state partners included the Austin American-Statesman in Texas, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in Georgia, and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The state partners brought some welcome revenue, but Brown didn?t insist that all the money go to cover our existing costs. He said much of it could be used for expansion. We also made some money from PolitiFact Mobile, a smartphone app we built with Adobe. But we put the money back into our journalism. It seemed every time I had a lead about a new revenue source, Brown would say, ?Great, we can use that money to hire another researcher.?</p>
<p>Other business efforts were less successful. We licensed the Obameter to a game company to sell a deck of cards of Obama?s 500 promises. But the cards were a flop. Surprisingly, people didn?t want to pay $17.95 for a deck of cards such as Promise No. 278: ?Remove more brush, small trees and vegetation that fuel wildfires.?</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>The Obama ?Promises? cards were a flop, selling fewer decks than there were promises.</p>
<p>We continued to struggle to make much money from advertising. The Times ad sales reps decided to use the inventory of PolitiFact ads for local companies, but it seemed odd to readers from, say, Seattle, to see ads for a golf course in Largo, Florida.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I LEFT THE EDITOR?S JOB&amp;#160;in 2013 to come to Duke University. Angie Holan became editor and Aaron Sharockman became executive director, a new position responsible for partnerships and finding new sources of revenue. Sharockman has assembled an impressive array of revenue sources that includes crowdfunding, the Truth Squad membership campaign, state partnerships, and foundation grants.</p>
<p>Today, PolitiFact is not only a journalistic success; it?s a thriving business. That?s possible because of an extraordinary 10-year commitment. The editors of the Times fostered an atmosphere that allowed us to build something bold?and then they stood by it for years.</p>
<p>Not every news organization can afford the investments and patience the Times? unconventional ownership gave PolitiFact. Many companies wouldn?t tolerate the way we defied advice and the constant pressure of a balance sheet. And yet PolitiFact?s partnerships with other for-profit news organizations across the country are a reminder that there are bold editors and reporters in most newsrooms who are still willing to try new things to deliver better journalism, even during a period of painful job cuts.</p>
<p>Being innovative sometimes requires jettisoning old routines. Taking on daily fact checks meant doing far less of the everyday political reporting that once dominated the Times?s Washington coverage. But PolitiFact?s success over the past decade is proof that committing to those tradeoffs and editorial experiments can pay off in big and surprising ways. That?s a critical lesson for everyone in the news business, not just fact-checkers.</p>

<article id="0000175" title="Mordechai Will Not Bow"><p></p>
<p>Since the Supreme Court?s infamous decision on June 26th to redefine marriage, our ideological opponents have openly mocked us. ?Your side lost,? they shout. ?It?s over! Just crawl into a corner and lick your wounds.?</p>
<p>Even before the Supreme Court?s decision, many conservative activists had already capitulated and thrown in the towel, urging us to consolidate our losses and move on. When it comes to homosexual issues, they assured us, the culture wars are over.</p>
<p>And that was prior to June 26th. Now, they tell us without question, the ship has sailed.</p>
<p>In the words of a hostile comment posted on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AskDrBrownVideos" type="external">YouTube</a> channel:</p>
<p>Similar sentiments were expressed by the <a href="https://twitter.com/noahmichelson" type="external">editor</a> for Huffington Post?s Gay Voices when we interacted on Twitter. He wrote: ?you can wage your war but people like kim davis and you are becoming jokes. you?ve lost.?</p>
<p>He was seconded by <a href="https://twitter.com/goodasyou" type="external">another</a> gay activist who simply wrote, ?and you already lost. Bye,? which drew this final word from the HuffPost editor:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>?YES. And we are never going back to the dark ages of inequality again ? over my dead faggot body.?</p>
<p>I responded, ?I stand for justice; I reject the redefinition of marriage. You never know how the tide will turn next.? And, ?Stay tuned. You?ll be quite surprised with what the future holds.?</p>
<p>History has a way of surprising us, does it not?</p>
<p>For years I have been saying that, as surely as there was a Civil Rights movement in America, there will be a gospel-based moral and cultural revolution, and I still believe that to the core of my being.</p>
<p>It may be counterintuitive.</p>
<p>Some may call it denial or cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>So be it.</p>
<p>I still believe, as surely as God is God, that unless Jesus returns to earth first, the tide will turn in America and there will be a holy pushback, a Spirit-empowered counterculture revolution.</p>
<p>How far it will go I do not know, but I sense that it is in the air already, at least in its earliest stages.</p>
<p>Not a war on gays.</p>
<p>Not an attempt to make America into a Christian theocracy.</p>
<p>But a grassroots uprising of committed followers of Jesus who refuse to cave in to the culture, regardless of which way the tide turns.</p>
<p>And so, no matter what society pushes on us and no matter what price we have to pay, by God?s grace, we will not capitulate and we will not compromise our convictions.</p>
<p>This is how we <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011A9LIJG/ref=pdp_new_dp_review" type="external">outlast the gay revolution</a>, although even to speak such words ? let alone write a whole book on that theme ? is to draw all kinds of ridicule, including online comments like this: ?You?re not outlasting [expletive]. This is here to stay.? And this, from a man named Paul: ?Hey white haired boy die off soon love to use your book for toilet paper.?</p>
<p>Sorry, Paul, but we?re not dying off. In fact, as the Lord shows favor, we are multiplying, not dying out.</p>
<p>So, you had better get used to it.</p>
<p>We?re here for the long haul, doing what is right, walking in love towards all, and refusing to compromise our convictions.</p>
<p>In the last chapter of Outlasting the Gay Revolution I share a famous account from the book of Esther about Haman and Mordechai.</p>
<p>Now, to be perfectly clear, I was not comparing Haman (who wanted to slaughter all the Jews) to gay activists (as if they wanted to slaughter their enemies).</p>
<p>That is not the point I was making, nor do I believe it to be true.</p>
<p>Instead, I pointed to an interesting psychological parallel between the attitude of Haman and the attitude of many gay activists, also pointing to Mordechai as an example to follow.</p>
<p>According to the book of Esther, although Haman had become a highly exalted official in the Persian Empire with all citizens having to bow down to him on sight, Mordechai refused to bow down, which really riled Haman (see Esther 3). The adulation of all the people was not enough for Haman. This one Jew had to bow the knee (or be killed) or Haman would not be satisfied.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the tables were turned and Mordechai became exalted, after which Haman?s demise came quickly.</p>
<p>In the same way, gay activists will not be satisfied with victory after victory as long as there is a group that refuses to bow down to their agenda, a group that is even allowed to dissent legally, which is why our religious freedoms are now under constant attack.</p>
<p>I?m here to declare that Mordechai will not bow.</p>
<p>As Jesus declared in a different context, the gates of hell will not prevail against the Church (see Matthew 16:18).</p>
<p>America may collapse into a moral stupor.</p>
<p>Pressure against believers may rise to an all-time national high.</p>
<p>But we are not going anywhere, and with the help of God Himself, I?ll say it again: Mordechai will not bow!</p>
<p>The opposition will only galvanize the remnant and make us stronger.</p>
<p>The revolution is gaining ground, and Mordechai is standing strong</p>
<p>Are you with me?</p>

<p>We have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, vulgarity, profanity, all caps, or discourteous behavior. Thank you for partnering with us to maintain a courteous and useful public environment where we can engage in reasonable discourse.</p>
<p>These religious [expletives] don?t only want to hate you they want to control you to. Ain?t happening in this life time. You lost this fight a long long time ago, you and all these stone aged, bible thumping, Neanderthal sheep are just too stupid to realize it. You have won nothing at all against gay marriage. Actually last i heard it?s legal in the whole u.s. now, that?s how much people won?t tolerate your religious prosecution of others. You can talk and whine like a little baby till someone sticks a bottle in your mouth, it won?t change the fact that gays are allowed to be married. Enjoy!</p></article>

<p>Well, the folks at Saturday Night Live now realize it- whites are approaching minority status and Mexicans are taking over. &amp;#160;So they made a sketch about it.

<p>The Chilean government and environmentalists are protesting the passage around Cape Horn of a ship carrying about 76 tons of spent nuclear fuel from the U.K. to Japan. Greenpeace Chile fears that the southern route around South America, longer and more treacherous than a trip through the Panama Canal, will become the preferred route for shipping nuclear waste. The group says that if an accident were to occur to the ship en route, it might rival the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. In 1995, the last time nuclear waste was shipped around Cape Horn, Chile?s navy blocked the ship from entering its waters.</p></article>
<article id="0000202" published-at="2016-03-26" title="We asked for your stories from the front lines of dieting. They were brutal."><p>This week, we took a <a href="" type="internal">deep dive</a> into the world of <a href="" type="internal">diet books</a> authored by doctors. The main premise of the piece: Most of these books purport to hold the one true secret to weight loss ? high protein, low carb, 5:2, "Wheat Belly," you name it. But these books contain a central falsehood: Not only is obesity an extremely complex problem unlikely to have a silver bullet, but what works when it comes to weight loss for any individual is unlikely to work for everybody else.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, more and more respected doctors, despite their good intentions, are complicit with the publishing industry in confusing science and obscuring hard truths about obesity to sell diet books. It's one thing when actress Gwyneth Paltrow tells people to avoid "nightshade vegetables" on an elimination diet, and quite another when a highly trained and credentialed physician sells a weight loss lie.</p>
<p>So I asked readers to share their experiences with diet books, and they kindly obliged. Here are some of the letters we've received so far, edited for length and clarity. As you'll note, people's struggles with weight loss and diet are extremely varied, as are the weight loss strategies that have helped. If you have a story you'd like to share, email me <a href="" type="internal">here</a>.</p>
<p>I followed The Bulletproof Diet fairly religiously for the better part of 18 months.</p>
<p>The first three were torturous. I have a sweet tooth to the point of it being a personal failing. Cutting nearly all carbs was excruciating. I kidded myself into thinking I felt better. I invented a sense of purity in that I was eating better than everyone, so I was actually a better person than everyone. That incredibly egotistic thought is the only thing that got me through those cravings for chips, soda, cake, ice cream, and everything wonderful. I had prismatic dreams of Cheetos and mac and cheese ? two foods I ate hardly at all before dieting but suddenly craved with a passion.</p>
<p>Those months passed, and I almost became acclimated to the suffering. Mostly, it was because the pounds started dropping off. When I started my diet, I was brushing the underside of 200 pounds. I'm a short woman, and I didn't carry that weight well. I had effectively sized myself out of "normal" clothing, and it severely impacted my self-esteem.</p>
<p>Eighteen months later, I got down to about 155 pounds. It was some perverse triumph to recross the line between obese and overweight in reverse. All my accomplishments in life paled.</p>
<p>Then I started fainting. All the time. I fainted in Las Vegas on vacation. I fainted on a whiskey distillery tour when the temperature inside the building was over 90 F. I got woozy grocery shopping on the weekends. I felt nauseous when talking a quick mile walk. I stopped working out, because raising my heart rate even a little made me feel like I was going to throw up.</p>
<p>So I kept things with sugar in my purse to eat when I got faint. It worked. Before long, it reopened that door to all the sugary things I loved. The more I returned to my old eating patterns, the better I felt. And the more weight I put on.</p>
<p>It took me 18 months to lose 50 pounds, and six to put them all back on again. My pants don't fit again. I'm about 190 pounds and climbing. I feel awful about myself and my failed diet.</p>
<p>I want to know what it is that I need to stop feeling this way. Maybe I'll be fat forever. I guess that's okay, if only I could stop feeling so terrible about myself. It's weird, but I can't seem to figure out who to blame. Myself, for failing to diet properly? The diet books and diet advice forums, for not being realistic? The diet itself, for making me so ill? Society, for teaching me that a woman's worth is inversely proportional to her pants size?</p>
<p>I just want to stop feeling this way.</p>
<p>I am actually part of the "5 percent" [who diet and keep the weight off].</p>
<p>I have kept off 80-plus pounds for 22 years (even lost the 35 pounds I gained while pregnant) I am actually 20 pounds lighter now, five years later, than I was when I got pregnant.</p>
<p>I was 19 when I changed my bad habits of overeating junk and not moving. Once I started moving and reducing the amount of junk I ate, the pounds came off. Through the years, though, I have consistently evolved my "diet."</p>
<p>I think our bodies are so different that what works for me may not work for someone else, and therein lies the problem with diet books. Also, I move a lot. I live in Brooklyn and have to walk everywhere. I have also gone to the gym two to three times a week for more than 15 years.</p>
<p>Yes, there have been a few weeks here and there that I can?t go, but consistency is key, as is building muscle.</p>
<p>My point is that every body is different and through trial and error you have to find what works best for your body. I went Paleo for a year and lost weight/gained muscle, but after eight months I was kinda terrible to be around because I was mostly in ketosis and you need carbs to feel normal. I think it?s great to "cut" sometimes and "eat clean," but it?s more important to eat healthy and not deprive yourself of a plate of pasta or cake every so often.</p>
<p>I am 52 years old. All my life I have consumed massive quantities of sugar and refined carbs. David Ludwig's "Always Hungry" has freed me from that addiction. It's improving the lives of many people. But the people who have been discouraged by your article will continue to suffer.</p>
<p>In college, I was 180 pounds. I'm 5-foot-8. So I stopped eating dinner. I'd stop eating around 3, but if I was really hungry I'd have soup and/or an apple. But nothing after 6. I lost 25 pounds in a month. (Yes, a 19-year-old metabolism helps). And I started watching what I was eating about halfway through. I have lived this most of my life.</p>
<p>I'm now 57, and I weigh 145 to 150. The book The 8-Hour Diet came out a couple of years ago and it best describes my plan. It really works (but I think it is best to eliminate dinner). I eat what I want. I don't count calories. I usually eat between 9-5 or 10-6. Weekends I'm off the diet, so I can go out to eat with my husband. I'm not uber-thin but my clothes fit just fine. I think for 57 I look just fine.</p>
<p>My diet story is about the ever-popular Whole30. A few years back, I decided to make a career change and return to school to study nutritional science at George Mason University. At the same time, I also undertook a Whole30 challenge through my CrossFit gym. Upon completion of the challenge, I thought the Whole30 was a drastic approach but believed people may be able to use it as a jumping-off point to kick-start lifelong healthy eating habits.</p>
<p>Fast forward two years. At this point, I'm deep into my nutritional science studies. I had begun to notice some less-than-scientific posts on the Whole30 Facebook page. One day, I happened to pick up the Whole30 book, It Starts With Food, off my bookshelf. Upon skimming through the book, I was mortified to find how much junk science was packed into its pages ? amazing what a few years of formal science education does for your critical thinking. This was a book that I had once recommended to friends and family members, so you can imagine my horror at discovering that I had played a part in propagating dietary misinformation.</p>
<p>As a way to help combat the pseudoscience being disseminated by the Whole30 folks, I decided to undertake a <a href="http://nutritionasiknowit.com/whole30/" type="external">chapter-by-chapter review of their book</a>. Since they provided 450-plus citations, I simply pulled each of the papers to see if the science matched up with the claims being made. Surprisingly, (or unsurprisingly) the vast majority of their claims were either misleading or outright falsehoods.</p>
<p>My hope is that these reviews serve to help dissuade people from viewing the Whole30 as an evidence-based diet and seek out healthier alternatives. I've had a lot of fun doing them and have learned quite a bit in the process of reading through all the scientific papers. I imagine it will take me years to complete the entire book, but I'm going to keep plugging away at it!</p>
<p>I'm actually currently using Ludwig's book [Always Hungry], not letter for letter, but as guidance on how to lose weight. I don't have the time to follow his food program exactly, but I have been trying to cut out refined carbohydrates and follow the general guidelines. I've been at it about 2.5 months, and it's been reasonably successful so far (12 pounds down, ~2 inches). About eight years ago I lost about 50 pounds, mostly by calorie restriction and increased exercise, but have gained much of that back over the intervening years, during which I suppose it was inertia that kept me from trying again.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's not really my point. I'm a scientist and was definitely as perturbed as you were about how poorly controlled, given the amount of other scientific evidence the book presents on past studies, the book's test program was.</p>
<p>But to me there's another angle to that: It doesn't seem like any of the recommendations he makes could really turn out harmful. It's easy to imagine many of them working. To do a properly controlled study would take many years, during which there are potentially thousands of people who could have made use of the largely sensible (as you point out) recommendations he gives. So while he probably should have been more upfront about the lack of rigor in the pilot program, I think presenting these recommendations now is on balance a good thing.</p>

<article id="0000217" published-at="2017-12-26" title="This year?s best movies, books, and podcasts about climate change"><p>I don?t know about you, but I spent a good portion of this year escaping. When your day job involves running fact-checks on the bizarre and short-sighted decisions that will determine the future for you and everyone you know, well, it helps to take a time-out every once in a while.</p>
<p>And there was some high-quality escapism on offer this year, from superhero blockbusters to dystopian page turners. But even in the fluffiest, most candy-coated realms of pop culture, our anxieties about the world have a way of creeping in. We?ve been steeping in this stuff and it shows, from the <a href="https://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2017/05/04/the_daily_show_tries_to_get_trump_to_care_about_climate_change.html" type="external">increasingly beleaguered comedians of late-night</a> who have to keep coming up with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5scez5dqtAc" type="external">new jokes about Paris climate talks</a> to robo-future shoot-em-up Blade Runner 2049?s <a href="https://moviepilot.com/p/blade-runner-2049-explores-creationism-ai-and-climate/4374192" type="external">thinly veiled warnings</a> about devastating environmental change.</p>
<p>So here are some of the most notable pieces of entertainment that brought the Grist staff down to earth this year:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The best thing on TV in 2017, and maybe ever, was <a href="https://www.hbo.com/the-leftovers" type="external">the last season of The Leftovers.</a> The premise is that 2 percent of the population spontaneously evaporated from the earth one day, and those remaining ? the leftovers, you see ? have to deal with the disappearance of their loved ones. One story line follows the Guilty Remnant, a cult dedicated to remembering the event with tactics that range from annoying to emotionally terrorizing to literally terrorizing. The overwhelming public response to the Remnant is: ?Leave us alone, so we can stop thinking about what we?ve lost.?</p>
<p>I don?t believe it?s meant to be an analogy for the climate conversation, but I saw so many similarities. Part of the resistance to acting on climate change comes from an unwillingness to acknowledge what is already lost ? certain sea-level rise, locked-in temperature increases, and irreversible change to our environments. It requires a kind of reckoning, a mourning, that most people would rather not undergo. If you watch the show as a portrayal of that kind of internal struggle, it?s really jarring.</p>
<p>Eve Andrews, Associate Editor</p>
<p>I love disaster movies. The Day After Tomorrow, 2012, Deep Impact ? give me a ridiculous global threat for our main characters to race against, and I?ll watch every rerun on SyFy. This year?s disaster flick is <a href="http://www.geostorm.movie/" type="external">Geostorm</a>. Given its 13 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, let?s just say this climapocalyptic blockbuster won?t be taking home any statues this award season.</p>
<p>The plot hinges on a government-run satellite system that controls all weather on Earth. Things go wrong, the satellites malfunction, and extreme weather starts leveling cities. It?s an overblown portrayal of the threat posed to life on earth by geoengineering and climate change.</p>
<p>Is this movie at all scientifically accurate? Nope! But if you, like me, enjoy watching people get frozen by ice storms, thrown around in tornadoes, and wiped out by skyscraper-leveling tsunamis, it?s worth a watch. Preferably in 4DX.</p>
<p>Cody Permenter, Social Media Manager</p>
<p></p>
<p>?Alternative facts? was the final straw: America has kind of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/how-america-lost-its-mind/534231/" type="external">lost its grip on reality</a>. Gimlet Media?s podcast <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/science-vs/" type="external">Science Vs</a> cuts through the crap: Do vitamin supplements do anything? Is 100 percent clean energy possible? Do women?s menstrual cycles actually sync up?</p>
<p>The podcast?s fearless host ? Australian science journalist Wendy Zukerman ? combs through the latest science, chats with experts, and cracks jokes that would make your dad proud. You might not always like all the answers (listen to the organic episode, dear Grist reader). But that?s sort of the point. It?s the antidote ? not the anecdote! ? that America needs right now.</p>
<p>Kate Yoder, News Editor</p>
<p>If you grew up watching Bill Nye give zany televised lessons on the fundamentals of science, you?ll probably enjoy this introduction to the man behind the bow tie. Directors David Alvarado and Jason Sussberg originally set out in 2014 to make a fun documentary about Nye?s legacy of communicating science by being irresistibly goofy. But then 2017 happened. ?With the Trump administration, it became so much more serious,? Alvarado says.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.billnyefilm.com/" type="external">resulting film</a> follows Nye on his quest to protect science education from creationists and climate change deniers, venturing into creation museums and theme parks to debate evolution. It?s not a purely flattering tribute, though it also delves into questions about Nye?s pedigree as a scientist (he has B.S. in mechanical engineering) and about how much he loves the limelight.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjCebKn4iic" type="external">movie</a> is deranged, in the best possible way. If you know anything about director Bong Joon Ho, that won?t surprise you at all ? his last feature to hit American theaters was 2014?s Snowpiercer, <a href="" type="internal">a parable of class warfare and global warming</a> set on a perpetual motion machine of a train. Talk about a plot device!</p>
<p>Okja takes on <a href="" type="internal">globalization and animal agriculture</a> with the same off-kilter enthusiasm, pitting terrifying, twinned Tilda Swinton against a South Korean farm girl and a friendly giant of a genetically engineered pig. The filming famously turned the director vegan (at least for a few months) and having watched it, I can see why! But its charms outweigh the ick factor, largely thanks to Ahn Seo-hyun?s performance as Mija and her bond with the lovable Okja.</p>

<p>Many people I know are truly scared to watch <a href="https://www.chasingcoral.com/" type="external">this documentary</a> because they think it is all doom and gloom, and we?ve got enough of that going around as it is. But Chasing Coral is more than that ? it?s luminous, honest, funny, and moving, a love letter to the magic of nature and the joy that we get from exploring the world. The filmmakers take us underwater to some of the most exquisite coral reefs and fish communities remaining on the planet, giving us <a href="" type="internal">a front-row seat to climate change in action</a>.</p>
<p>I?m going to host a showing of the film for friends in the new year. Eulogy or wake-up call, I think it?s worth being moved by the stunning and humbling complexity of our oceans and the coral that has been its seedbed.</p>

<p>Sourdough is <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/sourdough/robinsloan/9780374203108/" type="external">a ridiculous and playful novel</a> by Robin Sloan (who, full disclosure, wrote a blurb for one of my books). I mean, c?mon, it?s about sentient sourdough starter. It?s also the most realistic and compelling guide to the modern food debate I?ve encountered.</p>
<p>The story takes place in the San Francisco Bay Area, the scene of an ongoing struggle between two very different versions of foodie utopia. On one side is an Alice Waters?like character who champions tradition, artisanal labor, and the flavors of nature. On the other side there?s a Soylent-inspired company promoting exploration, efficiency, and new creation. According to the classic sci-fi formula, the story would be about how technological advancement creates a monster that must be defeated. But this book refuses to take sides. Like most of us, the novel values culture and tradition, but also yearns for newness and exploration. Like most of us, it?s wonderstruck by technology while also skeptical of it.</p>
<p>If everyone engaged in making a more equitable and sustainable food system took the lessons in Sourdough to heart, I think the partisan debate would end. It?s the techie-hippie divide that?s unnatural ? most of us want a bit of everything.</p>

<p>If you haven?t heard <a href="https://stownpodcast.org/" type="external">2017 breakout podcast S-Town</a>, please tell me what rock you?ve been living under so I can build a nuclear bunker there that would make John B. proud. The story, from the producers of This American Life and Serial, documents the life of one disillusioned, brilliant, misanthropic horologist as he alternately despairs and rejoices in the human capacity to muck up the best intentions. And, yes, that means he talks about climate change A LOT. As narrator Brian Reed laments, that doesn?t always make for uplifting conversation. (SORRY for boring you, Brian.) But it does make for some pretty gripping radio.</p>

<p>Terrestrial is <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/524952613/terrestrial" type="external">an environmental podcast</a> like you?ve never heard (case in point: Its unofficial tagline is <a href="https://twitter.com/grist/status/927993010528251904" type="external">?We?re fucked. Now what??</a>). Currently in its second season, the show profiles individuals making tough choices in the face of climate change, like a <a href="http://kuow.org/post/his-fellow-conservatives-call-him-green-decoy-heres-why-terrestrial" type="external">conservative hunter</a> who breaks rank to defend public lands or a <a href="http://kuow.org/post/teenager-rebellion-means-suing-government-over-climate-change-terrestrial" type="external">teenage girl</a> who joins a group suing the government over climate inaction. The show tackles big issues ? like climate change, air pollution, and environmental justice ? and tells those stories in a way listeners can relate to.</p>

<p>I was worried about the planet turning into a giant garbage patch where violent cage matches serve as the only distraction from pollution and massive income inequality. Then, I watched Thor: Ragnarok. Now, I?m thrilled about our planet turning into a giant garbage patch where violent cage matches serve as the only distraction from pollution and massive income inequality, as overseen by emperor Jeff Goldblum. Now there?s a magnetic personality!</p>

Van Jones ? the activist, author, former Obama administration&amp;#160;official, and current CNN commentator ?&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/22/opinions/prince-eight-things-to-know-jones/" type="external">revealed</a> that Prince had secretly funded causes&amp;#160;from public radio to Black Lives Matter to the Harlem Children?s Zone. He also conceived of&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.yeswecode.org/" type="external">#YesWeCode</a>, an initiative to train black&amp;#160;kids for&amp;#160;work in tech. And he&amp;#160;supported <a href="http://www.greenforall.org/" type="external">Green For All</a>, a group working to fight climate change and bring green jobs to underprivileged populations.&amp;#160;Jones is in the leadership of the latter two organizations.</p>
<p>?I was an Oakland activist giving speeches about the need for green jobs,? Jones told me over the phone, recalling how he first came into contact with the musician 10 years ago.&amp;#160;?Prince heard me in the media and&amp;#160;sent a $50,000 check to support the work I was doing. But he did all his giving completely anonymously, so I sent the check back. You never know when someone is trying to set you up ? it could have been from Chevron or from a drug dealer or whatever. So then&amp;#160;he sent the check back and I sent it back again, and then he sent it back and then I sent it back, until finally a representative called and said, ?Will you please accept this check? I won?t tell you who it is from, but the guy?s favorite color is purple.? I said, ?Well, now you have a different problem: I?m not gonna cash this check, I?m gonna frame it.??</p>
<p>Soon after, Prince reached out to Jones, and the two became friends ? a friendship that would last until his death. Jones? role in Prince?s life&amp;#160;was, he says, as ?his lead guitarist for social impact, for lack of a better term.? Jones helped distribute Prince?s&amp;#160;resources when he&amp;#160;didn?t want the attention, including providing solar panels for families in Oakland. The families never knew who their benefactor was.</p>
<p>As a Jehovah?s Witness, Prince wasn?t permitted&amp;#160;to advertise his good works. But even without his spiritual tradition, Jones says Prince would have been modest about his giving. ?He&amp;#160;thought it was in poor taste for these celebrities to get millions of dollars and then write a check and have their publicists all over the media bragging about it,? Jones said. ?He was like, ?This is ridiculous. We get enough attention. We?re celebrities.??</p>
<p>Jones says that what Prince really cared about was humanity.&amp;#160;?He cared about life and love and freedom,? Jones says. ?His politics were not red. They were not blue. They were purple.&amp;#160;He had a mind that let him see answers ? musically, spiritually, even politically. Rather than argue about global warming, he said, ?Let?s help kids put up solar panels.??</p>
<p>It?s clear in conversation that Jones deeply mourns the loss of his friend. When asked what he will miss most, he takes&amp;#160;a long pause, so long I think for a moment that the line has gone dead.</p>
<p>?Everybody will tell you about the songs, but the genius didn?t stop when he walked out of the studio,? Jones says. ?He was so hilariously, ridiculously funny. He was Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock, Kevin Hart?level funny. Dave Chapelle is probably funnier, but he?s the&amp;#160;only one. Everybody else, Prince could have eaten their lunch, and half the time with no curse words. That?s irreplaceable. You can?t find that on YouTube or iTunes.?</p></article>
<article id="0000233" published-at="2017-10-14" title="NKorea Vows 'Salvo of Missiles' on Guam as US Gears Up for Drills With Seoul"><p>North Korea has vowed that a "salvo of missiles"&amp;#160;will be unleashed on Guam and that it would keep its hands "closer to&amp;#160;trigger"&amp;#160;as U.S. drills begin with South Korea.</p>
<p>Reports also indicate that Pyongyang might soon test more missiles.</p>
<p>Kim Kwang Hak, a researcher at the Institute for American Studies of North Korea?s Foreign Ministry, issued the new threat Friday in an op-ed piece for the regime?s official <a href="https://kcnawatch.co/newstream/1507897837-64471623/u-s-reckless-military-moves-compel-dprk-to-take-action-researcher-of-institute-for-american-studies/" type="external">KCNA news agency</a>.</p>
<p>"We have already warned several times that we will take counteractions for self-defense including a salvo of missiles into waters near the U.S. territory of Guam, an advance base for invading the DPRK, where key U.S. bases are located, as the U.S. has resorted to military actions in sensitive regions, making the waters off the Korean peninsula and in the Pacific restless," Kim said.</p>
<p>Pyongyang?s threat came after the U.S. Navy announced Friday that the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier would lead drills with South Korea next week in the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea, <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/406670-north-korea-missiles-guam/" type="external">RT News reports</a>.</p>
<p>The Navy said that the drills were for honing "communications, interoperability, and partnership."</p>
<p>In addition, two U.S. Air Force B-1B Lancer bombers flew from Guam over the Korean Peninsula Tuesday night ? staging an aerial exercise in a show of force with Japanese and South Korean combat aircraft, according to reports.</p>
<p>North Korea <a href="" type="internal">first threatened Guam in August</a>after Trump warned that the regime would "face fire and fury like the world has never seen" and that the U.S. was "locked and loaded"&amp;#160;for Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Dictator Kim Jong Un briefly backed down, with officials saying that he would watch for provocation by the United States.</p>
<p>Tensions have only escalated since, with Trump slamming the dictator on Twitter as "Little Rocket Man" and Kim ripping the president as a "dotard."</p>
<p>"The U.S. military action hardens our determination that the U.S. should be tamed with fire and lets us take our hand closer to 'trigger' for taking the toughest countermeasure," researcher Kim said in Friday?s commentary.</p>
<p>"In case any shocking case occurs on the Korean peninsula, the U.S. will be made to hold responsibility as it is pushing the situation on the peninsula to the point of explosion while going reckless, being carried away by ill-advised bravery."</p>
<p>Kim also bashed Trump's social media use.</p>
<p>"What should not be overlooked is that such military moves have been conducted at a time when the Trump group posted on Twitter such letters reading that the US failed to handle North Korea for the past 25 years and only one thing will prove effective, while frequently hinting at 'military option'&amp;#160;backed by such rubbish as 'a calm before a storm'&amp;#160;and 'total destruction,'"&amp;#160;he said.</p>
<p>"It's senseless military provocations make us keenly realize once again that we were quite right when we decided to bolster the nuclear deterrence for self-defense in every way, and harden our conviction that we have to keep to this path forever," Kim said.</p>
<p>In addition, South Korean media reported Saturday that satellite images showed North Korea transporting ballistic missiles mounted on launchers out of hangars near Pyongyang, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/10/14/north-korea-preparing-launch-another-ballistic-missilein-retaliation/" type="external">according to The Telegraph.</a></p>
<p>The South Korean reports cited a government source.</p>
<p>U.S. military officials, according to the Seoul source, believe the activity could indicate that Pyongyang is preparing to test an inter-continental ballistic missile or an intermediate-range ballistic missile, the Telegraph reports.</p>
<p>Further, <a href="" type="internal">The Associated Press reported Frida</a>y that the South Korean weather agency detected a fourth small earthquake near Pyongyang?s nuclear test site.</p>
<p>However, unlike quakes associated with nuclear tests, they said the tremor did not appear to be man-made.</p>
<p>The quake was the fourth to be observed since Pyongyang's Sept. 3 nuclear test, which caused a 6.3-magnitude earthquake.</p>
<p>The tremors and landslides near the test site likely mean that North Korea?s sixth and largest blast ? the regime claimed it had tested a hydrogen bomb ? has destabilized the region, experts said.</p>
<p>They added that the Punggye-ri nuclear test site might not be used much longer for testing nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Before Bill O'Reilly embarked on his shameful and shameless attempt to cajole Donald Trump into reversing his decision to boycott tonight's Fox News Republican debate, Eric Bolling pleaded with Trump to "make a deal" with Fox.</p>
<p>Yesterday on The Five, cohost Eric Bolling sounded desperate as he made an on-air plea to Trump to "make a deal."</p>
<p>BOLLING: Donald, if you're listening, hopefully he's listening. You are a deal maker, make a deal. Make a last-minute deal. This is what you prided your whole campaign on. You have the most successful business book, "Art Of The Deal." Make a deal! I'm sure there are people around who would be willing to entertain a deal. Make a deal. It would be good for everybody.</p>
<p>Fortunately, cohost Juan Williams openly opposed the notion.</p>
<p>WILLIAMS: You know what? Fox News shouldn't make a deal on this. I mean, look If you let politicians start telling us what to do, then democracy is in trouble. ...Right now, and I hope for all time, that people like our bosses here do not make deals with politicians. I don't care what you feel about how he was treated at the first debate, whether you think it was fair, unfair, over the line. Look, you can't have journalists being told this is the deal for how we deal with you.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more disturbing than Trump's attempt to control how the media covers him is how little Fox News "freedom lovers" seem to care about that point. It was conspicuously absent from <a href="" type="internal">O'Reilly's pathetic groveling</a> to Trump last night and from Bolling's exhortations here.</p>

<p>Co-Host, False Flag Weekly News</p>
<p>The Global War on Terror, 2001-2016: Fifteen Years of the 9/11 Cover Up</p>
<p>Looking back with hindsight fifteen years after the transformative events of September 11, 2001, the quality of life for most people has significantly declined since 9/11. Beginning immediately on the very day of infamy, the forces of authoritarian reaction began to ramp up the power of unbridled militarism abroad and greatly expanded police powers at home, all in the name of combating Islamic terrorism. But what really happened on 9/11? Who did what to whom? Who is telling the truth and who is lying?</p>
<p>In the fifteen years since 9/11 a vast and multi-faceted citizens? movement has done much of the investigative work that our thoroughly corrupted governments refused to do on our behalf. Why have there been no genuine investigations by officialdom into the originating event of the Global War on Terror? How was the federal investigation of the 9/11 crime transformed into a federally orchestrated cover up?</p>
<p>The outcome of the people?s inquiry points compellingly to the conclusion that the real culprits behind the 9/11 attacks were not a group of Islamic jihadists acting alone out of no other motivation than religious zealotry. Rather, the dominant group directing the 9/11 false flag event was composed primarily of Israel First neoconservatives who sought to demonize Muslims in order to create the necessary malleable enemy required for their purposes. The real culprits of 9/11 used the event to create a replacement enemy meant to revitalize the vast military and national security apparatus that was fast becoming obsolete following the end of the Cold War with the demise of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>One of the objectives of the 9/11 criminals was to traumatize whole populations thereby making them more compliant and subject to manipulation. From the opening hours of the 9/11 debacle, the murder and mayhem was immediately blamed, without any forensic investigation whatsoever, on Muslim extremists said to be hostile to the West. The event was thereby framed within a pre-existing geopolitical concept already dubbed by&amp;#160; <a href="http://books.simonandschuster.com/The-Clash-of-Civilizations-and-the-Remaking-of-World-Order/Samuel-P-Huntington/9781451628975" type="external">Samuel Huntington as ?a clash of civilizations.?</a>&amp;#160;The effect of the instant interpretation was to cast the Jewish state?s regional enemies as part of a larger Islamic conspiracy to undermine ?the West.?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Huntington?s&amp;#160;Clash of Civilizations&amp;#160;was meant to signal that the core political economy of the USA, the so-called permanent war economy, should continue even though the Cold War had ended. The fabricated story line introduced on 9/11 was consistent with Huntington?s assessment that the new post-Cold War conflicts would cut across religious and cultural spheres of human interaction. With Huntington and Bernard Lewis as their guides, the authors of the 9/11 psychological operation have developed a false concept of ?the West? as an exclusively Judeo-Christian construct. This post-9/11 interpretation has involved the creation of a false assumption that the history of Islamic religion, culture and philosophy is entirely external to the history of Western Civilization.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;The characterization of Islam as a new and aberrant strain of influence in Europe and throughout the so-called ?West? misrepresents the deep history of cross-cultural interaction. The Zionist-directed campaign to mischaracterize Muslims as a recent and alien injection into Western Civilization fails to take into account the importance of Islamic advances in mathematics, architecture, medicine and art in the genesis of the European Renaissance. As Edward Said has reminded us, there is an especially rich heritage in the Iberian peninsula of cross-fertilization between Jewish, Christian and Muslim scholars. Their collaborative exchanges flourished especially in Cordoba, the Iberian jewel of the Islamic caliphate of Al-Andalus.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;Since 2001 the culprits of 9/11 have hired, armed, organized, and directed various mercenary proxy armies that fight under Islamic flags. With assistance being channeled especially through the CIA and Mossad safe haven of Saudi Arabia, these mercenary forces have done the bidding of their Zio-American patrons. Western-supported mercenary forces, including al-Qaeda and its supposed antagonistic cousin the ?Islamic State? [ISIL, ISIS, IS, Daesh], have been deployed in a series of false flag terror events designed to keep alive anti-Muslim fear and loathing in Western minds.</p>
<p>Moreover, units of the so-called ?Islamic State?, which funnel stolen oil to the European Union through Turkey, are regularly deployed throughout the&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Grand-Chessboard-American-Geostrategic-Imperatives/dp/0465027261" type="external">Grand Chessboard of Eurasia</a>. The aim is to give justification for Western military operations aimed ultimately at preparing the ground for the expansion of Greater Israel. The world?s dominant military-industrial complex has been covertly harnessed to this project of expansion. A crucial part of this network of military-industrial power lies in the Zionist-controlled mainstream media and institutions of higher education. These agencies have been co-opted to become instruments of the Islamophobic propaganda so crucial to preparing Western public opinion for aggressive invasions of Muslim countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Libya and most recently Syria.</p>
<p>The deceptive fa?ade of the Global War on Terror is meant to disguise this military and psychological system of aggressive warfare combined with engineered pollution of the mental environment with the toxin of hyped up Islamophobia. &amp;#160;</p>
<p><a href="/author.html?id=946" type="external">Dr. Kevin Barrett</a>&amp;#160;has characterized the Global War on Terror as a global war on Muslims for Israel. Noam Chomsky disagrees. He has made himself a very significant nemesis to Kevin Barrett. Barrett is one of the most unrelenting researchers and publicists in the 9/11 Truth Movement. So far Chomsky has been quite effective in deploying his enormous prestige to prevent the citizens? investigation on 9/11 from receiving a fair hearing, but especially in the foundation-funded platforms of progressive, Left, and anti-war activism.</p>
<p>This opening part introduces my essay, "9/11 and the Zionist Question: Is Noam Chomsky a Disinfo Agent for Israel?" In due course the larger paper will be published in its entirety here at&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">American Herald Tribune</a>.&amp;#160;This essay explores the antagonisms between Kevin Barrett and Noam Chomsky with particular emphasis on the research and scholarship on false flag terrorism and especially on the contested events of 9/11. The argument is advanced that Prof. Chomsky has quite purposely promoted an agenda of cover up on 9/11, reducing himself to the level of crude propagandists and paid proponents of the dominant 9/11 narrative such as Jonathan Kay and Michael Shermer.</p>
<p>In the fifteen years since 9/11 the concerted and continuing cover up of the truth has become an enormous element of the overall 9/11 crime. Growing understanding of the role of mass media and institutions of higher learning in maintaining this cover up is fast eroding the credibility of these strategic agencies. The health of free and democratic societies depends on an informed citizenry who more often than not are deceived by the very agencies supposed to be responsible for public education.</p>
<p>Noam Chomsky as the Left?s Trojan Horse</p>
<p></p>
<p>In his recent presentation at the ?Left Forum? in New York, Kevin Barrett didn?t mince words. He rarely does. Barrett accused the 87-year old Noam Chomsky of contributing to the fast deterioration of the human condition by purposely diverting skeptical attention away from the true culprits responsible for the lies and crimes of September 11, 2001. In his essay, ?Why Chomsky is Wrong on 9/11,? Barrett extended a growing trajectory of suspicion questioning the real agenda motivating America?s most highly publicized professor.&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/the-lies-and-crimes-of-911/10117" type="external">What is behind Dr. Chomsky?s zeal</a>&amp;#160;to obstruct fair and balanced professional debate about contested interpretations of 9/11?</p>
<p>The contradictions are conspicuous between Chomsky?s oft? proclaimed ideals as an academic investigator and the personalized vitriol of his attacks on those exposing the litany of lies permeating the most transformative event of the twenty-first century. The stakes in this matter are high indeed given the hagiographic extremes associated with Prof. Chomsky?s worldwide reputation. In the eyes of millions, Chomsky is the primary academic embodiment of anti-establishment dissidence within the US system of higher education.</p>
<p>Barrett?s critique of Chomsky adds to the observations of an already sizeable list of public intellectuals that have come to the conclusion that the celebrity Prof is not what he seems to be. The increasingly insistent accusation is that the crude diversionary tactics deployed by Prof. Chomsky in discouraging skeptical investigation of 9/11 reveals him to be a Trojan horse that has succeeded in subverting the Left from within. Among the commentators that have strongly criticized Chomsky?s work as a limited hangout are Ken Adachi, Barrie Zwicker, Daniel L. Abrahamson, James Corbett, Jeff Blankfort, Douglas Herman, Alfred Schaefer, and Benjamin Marhav.</p>
<p>Chomsky in discouraging skeptical investigation of 9/11 reveals him to be a Trojan horse that has succeeded in subverting the Left from within.</p>
<p>Internet broadcaster&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/meet-noam-chomsky-academic-gatekeeper-video/" type="external">James Corbett</a>&amp;#160;has encapsulated the consternation concerning the obvious contradictions internal to Chomsky?s academic work. Depending on his subject,&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.google.ca/?client=safari&amp;amp;channel=iphone_bm#channel=iphone_bm&amp;amp;q=adachi+rethinking+chomsky" type="external">Chomsky develops themes</a>&amp;#160;that contrapuntally expose and promote the workings of empire. Corbett has argued, ?Whatever Chomsky is doing, he is functioning as if he?s working hand in hand with the very elite&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article143519.html" type="external">he proclaims to be fighting against</a>.?</p>
<p></p>
<p>?Intellectuals Are In a Position to Expose the Lies of Government?</p>
<p>Chomsky?s academic work began in the 1950s in the field of linguistics. Chomsky?s analysis of speech, the primary medium of communicative interaction among humans, highlights his theories about the universality of mental structures governing the convergence of perception, abstraction, and articulation. Chomsky famously imagined a ?black box? of language formulation as part of a universal feature of human brains. Chomsky?s metaphors on human mental hardware naturally attracted the attention of deep state operatives in the CIA and related agencies with a professional interest in influencing human attitudes and behaviors.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>The scholar?s original academic discipline, therefore, provided him with an excellent platform from which to launch his applied study of the connections linking propaganda to contemporary imperialism and warfare. Since the late 1960s Chomsky has entered the outer stratosphere of intellectual notoriety, both pro and con, based on his very public interventions into the big contemporary issues of life and death, war and peace. From his very secure base of academic tenure at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Prof. Chomsky would emerge in the final decades of the twentieth century to become probably the most recognized and oft quoted professor in the entire history of American higher education.</p>
<p>Beginning with his opposition to US military intervention in Indochina, Chomsky applied his expertise in linguistic manipulation to the study of the media?s role in manufacturing consent for many nefarious operations. In a 1967 article entitled ?The Responsibility of Intellectuals,? Chomsky explained his intervention in what was then the most contentious issue in domestic and international politics. In hard-hitting prose that created markers against which Chomsky?s position on 9/11 would later be measured, the MIT professor wrote, ?It is the responsibility of intellectuals to speak the truth and expose lies.?</p>
<p>While all citizens have the responsibility to oppose deceptions and crimes committed on our behalf, intellectuals have an added weight of responsibility to act in the public interest against state terror and injustice.&amp;#160; <a href="https://chomsky.info/19670223/" type="external">?Intellectuals,? he wrote</a>, ?are in a position to expose the lies of governments, to analyze actions according to their causes and motives and often hidden intentions.?</p>
<p>A Jewish Sage and Lawgiver Preaching from</p>
<p>New England?s Most Prestigious Academic Pulpit</p>
<p>The contrasting treatment of Kevin Barrett and of Noam Chomsky by the custodians of US higher education forms a revealing backdrop against which to appreciate the deeper implications of the former?s assessment of the latter at the Left Forum. In recent decades Chomsky?s dramatic career has come to be invested with a kind of Hollywoodized aura. For his adept and incredibly prolific jabs directed at corporate giants, war hawks and the like, Chomsky was embraced as the Left?s most tireless warrior of the pen. He is a wordsmith of the first order who, in his spoken language, articulates frequently with such precise effect that transcripts of his speeches, interviews and panel discussions are often quickly transcribed to become popular publications.</p>
<p>Many have come to think of Chomsky as a kind of secular prophet seeking to inspire his followers to save America from its own worst attributes. The intensity of Chomsky?s mission to redeem America invokes Old Testament ideals of the City on the Hill, the New Jerusalem. The theocratic ideals associated with the creation of a New Jerusalem in the New World have churned through the dynamic matrix of US history ever since the Calvinist Puritans founded New England. New England?s founding Protestant patriarchs conceived of themselves as Israelites, as God?s Chosen People chartered by the Lord to realize a special evangelical mission.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>The perception that there was a divine charter underlying the Puritans? creation of Massachusetts extended to the sense of ?Manifest Destiny? invoked to explain and justify the transcontinental expansion of the US republic in the nineteenth century. American exceptionalism is the term currently used to identify the secular outgrowth of the old religious justifications for imperial expansion. The psychology of God-given exceptionalism has animated US expansionism throughout its transition from transcontinental to hemispheric to trans-Pacific to global proportions.</p>
<p>In seeming to lead the Left?s quest for the Promised Land of liberation from corporatist tyranny, Chomsky has come to embody key elements of the American Dream. A strong statement is seemingly announced by the fact that Chomsky has been able to perform his dissenting role from a place of tenured academic security at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. With Harvard and about twenty other prestigious universities nearby, MIT is one of the most well established, stable, and safe platforms of intellectual power in the United States.</p>
<p>Chomsky?s academic home is well known for its old, deep and elaborate ties with the research arms of the military-industrial complex and its attending agencies of so-called national security. In spite of the military attachments and connotations of his academic home, however, Prof. Chomsky was permitted to thrive as a leading critic of the very interests that contributed significantly to his reputation and primary livelihood. One apparent implication of Chomsky?s career path is that a key institution at the very strategic core of the American superpower was made to appear accepting of radical criticism from within. This accommodation of Chomsky?s scholarly political activism conveyed the implicit message that the USA continues to be alive to constant adaptive change in response to a never-ending need for intellectual and logistical renewal.</p>
<p>Shakespearian chords resonate through the drama that has culminated in Professor Chomsky becoming the most high profile academic elder of Cambridge Massachusetts. The scholar grew into the role of a Jewish sage and lawgiver revered as a modern-day prophet preaching from the most prestigious secular pulpit in the American capital of higher education. From this important site of power in the Promised Land where New England?s Calvinist founders once found refuge from their persecutors in Europe, the Left?s favorite scholarly jurist handed down many judgments and dictums.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Chomsky?s decision to side with power and against skeptical analysis of the lies and crimes of 9/11 would prove to be the most consequential judgment of his entire career.&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/9-11-Noam-Chomsky/dp/1583224890" type="external">In a book first published in November of 2001</a>&amp;#160;and in many judgments delivered extemporaneously from his academic pulpit, Prof. Chomsky condemned as heretics those engaged in skeptical investigation of 9/11. The effect of Chomsky?s fatwa on systematic research into the deep state origins and character of the 9/11 crime was the professional equivalent to an intellectual burning of heretics on the cross of professional infamy.</p>
<p>Chomsky?s academic oversight of the professional assault on 9/11 skeptics amounts to a twenty-first century equivalent in a professional context to the Salem Witch Trials. Indeed, New England?s heritage of Puritan witch trial proceedings is made to weave through many features of the psychological operation attached to the aggressive warfare mounted by the real protagonists of the 9/11 crimes.</p>
<p>By misrepresenting the scholarly and pedagogical work of Muslim academic Kevin Barrett, Prof. Chomsky has led the academic facet of the twenty-first century?s most severe and unrelenting witch hunt. The University of Wisconsin?s professional martyrdom of Dr. Kevin Barrett, whom Dr. Chomsky smears with careless disregard for even the rudimentary niceties of academic protocol, well illustrates the nature of the post-9/11 assault on reason, due process, human rights, civil liberties, evidence-based reportage and decency itself. The episode constitutes a telling illustration of the elaborate psychological operation aimed at diverting Left-leaning activists from paying close attention to the true nature of the 9/11 crime.</p>
<p>At the Left Forum in New York, Dr. Barrett was outspoken in holding Noam Chomsky accountable for his directing role in the Left?s failure to deal cogently with the core realities of who did what to whom in the originating event of the ongoing 9/11 Wars.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>&amp;#160;Truth Telling, Whistle Blowing and the American Way</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over decades Chomsky has moved towards the center of formidable networks of academic associations, publishing enterprises, activist groups, speakers forums and New Media operations. The fact that the senior professor is so well wired into such an effective communication grid of activist interaction has hugely amplified his voice and his influence.</p>
<p>Chomsky?s ideas have been broadcast to the far corners of the world in every conceivable format. His work is translated into many languages as the MIT professor goes from honor to honor, distinction to distinction, all the while seeming to combat the expansionary impulses emanating from some of the world?s leading centers of power including those in Israel. The phenomenal success of Chomsky?s career would seem to prove and illustrate that there is still some substance in the conception of America as the land of the free, home of the brave.</p>
<p>Dr. Barrett?s career path presents a very different picture of the role of the academy in US society. Barrett is the child of a strong Wisconsin family that also embodied many classic elements in the American Dream. Kevin Barrett?s father, Peter, was a lawyer, engineer, finance professor and successful businessman. He also became an Olympic Gold Medalist in sailing in 1968.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 1964 Barrett?s father would have won a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics if he had not disqualified himself at the end of a sailing competition by confessing that (not noticed by anyone else) he had lightly brushed against another boat early in the race.</p>
<p>In 2006 Kevin Barrett is reported to have referred to this episode during the ordeal of his trial by media. This public inquisition came about as a result of Kevin Barrett?s incorporation of views skeptical of the dominant 9/11 narrative into his pedagogy at the University of Wisconsin. Drawing implicit connections between his father?s decision in Tokyo and his own insistence on integrating the quest for 9/11 truth into the broader panorama of his academic work,&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;amp;address=186x15720" type="external">the young academic commented</a>, ?Cheating for strategic advantage is never right. It?s important to follow the truth no matter what.?</p>
<p>Much is revealed by the contrasting treatment delivered on the dissident academic Kevin Barrett and on Leftist superstar Noam Chomsky. Dr. Barrett?s career so far runs against the Hollywood version of how the heroic deeds and revelations of whistle blowers are received. In the Hollywood version of redemption through unrelenting truth telling, the solitary hero often ends up overcoming the deceit of corrupt and ruthless opponents. The honesty of the solitary hero is made to triumph, thereby saving civilization along with innocent civilians from horrific cataclysms.</p>
<p>In real life America, however, this scenario of redemption through truth telling is more the aberration than the rule.&amp;#160;Most whistle blowers are met with silence, avoidance and denigration of the type that Noam Chomsky has heaped on Kevin Barrett. The more common scenario of whistle blowing in America is for the truth teller to be sidelined and crushed in a harsh system of institutionalized cover-up hugely biased towards the rule of money and political expediency. &amp;#160;</p>
<p>From Operation Gladio to the False Flag Terror Events</p>
<p>Animating the ?Global War on Terror?</p>
<p>Dr. Barrett?s talk at the Left Forum in May of 2016 helped break an ideological prohibition at a venue that had previously blocked presentations by investigators that share some of his views. For fourteen years, any and all thinkers that rejected the official narrative of 9/11 were excluded, including those situated intellectually along the left-oriented spectrum of political identification.</p>
<p>The Left Form is an outgrowth of the annual Socialist Scholars? Conference at City University of New York. In Barrett?s view Chomsky became the virtual Pope of the Left Forum Vatican, a venue peopled by admirers prone to revere their secular Pontiff as sacrosanct and infallible. In helping to break the hold of such an unseemly intellectual exclusion of 9/11 skeptics, Barrett brought to the proceedings his own unique style of&amp;#160;Truth jihad. With his struggle to bring truth into the light of public awareness, the Muslim American scholar helped liberate free speech in a forum that during the Cold War was itself infested with the depredations of anti-communist witch hunts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A convert to Islam since 1992, Dr. Barrett learned Arabic on the way to his writing his Ph.D. thesis on Sufi literature. In 2006 he was ousted from his position as a Lecturer at the University of Wisconsin where he had taught since 1996. Barrett?s alleged crime was to have assigned skeptical as well as orthodox readings on 9/11 in one of his seventeen weeks of classes in an introductory course entitled&amp;#160;Islam: Religion and Culture.</p>
<p>In retrospect, Dr. Barrett was adapting his curriculum to a subject with huge ramifications for Muslims in all walks of life the world over.&amp;#160; The real academic crime in this situation would have been for an instructor of a survey course on Muslim thought, devotion and experience to have ignored this reality; to have evaded some sort of reckoning with the immense implications of 9/11 for the Islamic world.</p>
<p>Dr. Barrett?s reasonable pedagogical response to major changes in global geopolitics became fraught with controversy of great strategic significance for the future of our academic institutions. The Rupert Murdoch media in the United States, but especially Fox News, became an especially forceful engine of the bandwagon on which many ambitious publicity-seeking politicians jumped. For a time the University of Wisconsin held the sacred ground of academic freedom. Its academic leaders found in an internal investigation that Dr. Kevin Barrett had been conscientious presenting a wide array of competing perspectives on 9/11.</p>
<p>The fact that Dr. Barrett is a Muslim himself formed a significant part of the circumstances that caused him to be singled out.&amp;#160; His inquisitors in the media chose to transform him into a symbol of those said to be attacking the American way through the subversion of American youth.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Much evidence supports the view that the most important motivating factor in the planning, implementation and cover up of the ongoing 9/11 operation has been to inject fear of Islamic religion and Muslim people into the minds of non-Muslim populations. The aim of this purposeful contamination of the mental environment is to transform Israel?s regional enemies, but especially the Palestinians, into one part of a larger transnational Muslim enemy said to be hostile to all Western freedoms. As Barrett asserted at the Left Forum in New York, the 9/11 Black Op was to create the basis for a ?100 year war on Muslims for Israel.?</p>
<p>The 9/11 Black Op was to create the basis for a ?100 year war on Muslims for Israel.?</p>
<p>The 9/11 culprits delivered the fabricated imagery of global Islamic terror to the proprietors and beneficiaries of America?s permanent war economy. Especially since 9/11, the strategy has been to create patsies and to sponsor covertly the recruiting, organizing, arming, and violent incursions of mercenary soldiers. Whether pictured under the flags of al-Qaeda, al-Nusra or the so-called ?Islamic State?, these mercenary forces are paid handsomely to perform the role of vicious Muslim terrorists acting out of no other motivation than their own blood-thirsty religious extremism.</p>
<p>In this fashion the new enemy has been shaped, inflated and deployed as needed in order to justify all sorts of interventions, including aggressive warfare anywhere in the world. Under Israeli direction the core of the US political economy was thus revivified in the name of anti-terrorism. After the demise of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s the military-industrial complex needed a new enemy. Neoconservative activists supplied ?the West? with a concocted enemy. They also helped ramp up the activities of the war machine with the necessary political bribes, media propaganda and military directives aimed at transforming the US Armed Forces into an edified instrument for the expansion and further empowerment of Greater Israel.</p>
<p>The alignment of opposing forces in Syria well illustrates the way the core countries and satellites of the Israeli-American juggernaut have integrated mercenary forces fighting under Islamic flags into the machinery of aggressive and psychological warfare. NATO?s program of false flag terrorism in Europe was one of the models for this new round of false flag terrorism aimed at demonizing Muslims. Where the operatives of Operation Gladio engineered violent acts in the 1970s and 80s to blame and thereby demonize both communists and left-leaning progressives, the current round of serial false flag terror events is aimed at inciting Islamophobia. The manufacturing of hatred towards Muslims is a necessary psychological pillar of Likudnik Israel?s agenda of violent expansion.</p>
<p>The manufacturing of hatred towards Muslims is a necessary psychological pillar of Likudnik Israel?s agenda of violent expansion.</p>
<p>A key facet of this strategy of tension is the increasingly transnationalized and privatized police state that has become deeply intertwined with a massively augmented surveillance state. Since 9/11 the apparatus of law enforcement has been thoroughly politicized and turned against the human rights, civil liberties and public interests of citizens. Without a doubt the quality of life has declined significantly, as the instruments of Cold War anti-communism have been transformed into agencies supposedly devoted to anti-terrorism. This concocted series of post-9/11 conflicts, starting with the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, are presented in ways calculated to confuse, deceive, disorient and mislead an anxiety-ridden public. Police and military coercions to hold and expand empire are misrepresented as simple fights for and against ?terror.?</p>
<p>This phony war on terror originates in the 9/11 deceptions. This phony war draws on a long heritage of duplicity in international banking, where the same financiers loan money to both sides in conflicts. In many core episodes in the so-called Global War on Terror, both sides are subject to the control of the same paymasters, the same high-finance power brokers. In this heavily engineered series of manufactured conflicts, citizens expected to pay the enormous cost of these military operations are plunged into a fog of war. Whole populations are deceived, distracted and mercilessly exploited. We are presented with a barrage of alarming media images constantly signaling to us that our most menacing enemy on earth is the scourge of Islamic terrorism.</p>
<p>The phony war on terror&amp;#160;draws on a long heritage of duplicity in international banking, where the same financiers loan money to both sides in conflicts.</p>
<p>One of many intended consequences is to divert our attention away from our growing subjugation to the bondage of compounded debt enslavement. This theft is imposed through the machinations of the world?s centralized private banks. These kleptocratic institutions exploit the indebtedness of nations to privatize the ownership of commonly-held infrastructures and resources, all the while forcing governments to cut back resources for public services like health care, education and social security.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>&amp;#160;Still No End in Sight of the Murder and Mayhem Wrought by the 9/11 Culprits</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Back in 2006 all but a prescient few, such as Christopher Bollyn, perceived it as premature to try to identify and bring to justice the actual perpetrators of the 9/11 crimes. There was still some residue of confidence that responsible officials in government, law enforcement, media and the universities could and would respond in good faith to multiple revelations that great frauds had occurred in interpreting 9/11 for the public.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the main methodology of public intellectuals like Dr. Kevin Barrett or, for instance, Professors David Ray Griffin, Steven E. Jones, Peter Dale Scott, Graeme MacQueen, John McMurtry, Michael Keefer, Richard B. Lee, A.K. Dewdney, Nafeez Mossadeq Ahmed, and Michel Chossudovsky, was to marshal evidence demonstrating that the official narrative of 9/11 could not be true.</p>
<p>The marshaling of evidence was spurred on by observations coming from government insiders like Eckehardt Wertherbach, a former head of Germany?s intelligence service. In a meeting in Germany with Christopher Bollyn and Dr. Andreas von B?low, Wertherbach pointed out that, ?an attack of this magnitude and precision would have required years of planning. Such a sophisticated operation would require the fixed frame of a state intelligence organization, something not found in a loose group like the one led by the student Mohammed Atta in Hamburg.?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Andreas von B?low was a German parliamentarian and Defense Ministry official. He confirmed this assessment in his book on the CIA and 9/11. In the text von B?low remarked that the execution of the 9/11 plan ?would have been unthinkable without backing from secret apparatuses of state and industry.? The author spoke of the ?invented story of 19 Muslims working with Osama bin Laden in order the hide the truth? of the real perpetrators? identity.</p>
<p>Christopher Bollyn,&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Die-CIA-September-Andreas-Bulow/dp/3492242421" type="external">Solving 9/11:The Deception That Changed the World</a>, 2012, p.15</p>
<p>Andreas von B?low: The execution of the 9/11 plan ?would have been unthinkable without backing from secret apparatuses of state and industry.?</p>
<p>In the early years the pioneer researchers and organizers of the 9/11 Truth Movement began the process of marshaling evidence that demonstrated beyond any shadow of doubt that the original narrative of the 9/11 crimes could not be true. From this it followed that the public was entitled to a credible and true explanation, from the responsible authorities, about what really transpired on 9/11. To arrive at this outcome the Bush administration?s now-thoroughly-discredited&amp;#160;9/11 Commission Report, sometimes also known as the Kean-Hamilton report, would have to be put aside.</p>
<p>Released in 2004, the&amp;#160;9/11 Commission Report&amp;#160;was drafted primarily by the Commission?s executive director, Philip Zelikow. Zelikow is a history professor who was a well-known political operative active in the Bush White House. Zelikow was a prominent member of the Israeli First network in and around the war cabinet and staff of US President George W. Bush. Zelikow is recognized for his professional expertise in studying, creating and deploying public mythology as a tool for the shaping of public attitudes and behavior.</p>
<p>The chairs of the 9/11 Commission failed to stop Zelikow from drawing on counterfeit evidence obtained illegally through torture. Zelikow deployed this tainted testimony to embed, in the conscious and subconscious minds of the trusting public, the religious fable of 9/11.&amp;#160; <a href="http://starlarvae.blogspot.de/2013/03/the-official-story-narrating-public.html" type="external">The&amp;#160;9/11 Commission Report</a>&amp;#160;entrenched in public mythology the imagery of&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/1998-11-01/catastrophic-terrorism-tackling-new-danger" type="external">demonic Islamic extremists</a>&amp;#160;motivated exclusively by their theocratic zealotry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The new investigation called for by many prominent members of the 9/11 Truth Movement would have to transcend the realm of partisan politics; it would have had to be staffed by neutral parties of high esteem capable of rendering genuine third-party adjudication that goes to the very roots and origins of the 9/11 crime. To this day no such honest investigation has taken place. Meanwhile the citizens? investigation of 9/11 has continued to bring forward more and more evidence that proves conclusively that from September 11, 2001 until this day, authorities are lying to the public about 9/11 and many related topics. Thus the lies of 9/11 continue to form the basis of public policy, the basis of decisions made everyday about who lives and who dies.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>The scope and depth of the citizens? investigation on 9/11 is hard to fathom in terms of the number of researchers involved, the diversity of specific topics covered, and the array of various types of expert knowledge brought to the project of separating fact from fiction. As one observer has noted, ?In the annals of history, no event has ever been so thoroughly dissected by as many disparate humans as the&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.lostscribemedia.com/news/911-israels-masterpiece/" type="external">9/11/01 Massacre</a>.?</p>
<p>Of course the quality of the work being developed in the field of 9/11 studies spans the spectrum from excellent to poor. This variation has resulted in the evolution of improvised versions of peer review that developed among experts both inside and outside the halls of academia. Some, like Noam Chomsky, choose to mock and demean these people?s process of distinguishing empirically demonstrable truth from the lies of corrupt officialdom. Why would Chomsky show such contempt and to what end?</p>
<p>What must always be born in mind is that the citizens? investigation into 9/11 is first and foremost a public service done because the responsible authorities have failed to do their jobs. The authorities have acted criminally at worst, contrary to the public interest at best. Our compromised and discredited officials have failed almost uniformly to provide citizens with a credible explanation for a major event that has significantly transformed all our lives decidedly for the worse. So far the negative fallout has rained down with particular severity on Muslims. Millions of them have been killed, maimed, poisoned, displaced, and tortured in a series of wars all originating in a specious interpretation of what transpired on 9/11.</p>
<p>There is still no end in sight to the murder and mayhem. The failure to address the crimes of 9/11 with truth rather than with the constant resort to the 9/11 fable has become a major factor in the delegitimization of government. Never has public confidence been lower in our most basic institutions of governance, finance, policing, education, and media of mass communications.</p>
<p>In the decade since 2006 the realization has grown that there is little chance that those in charge of our core institutions would dare press for a genuine investigation to identify the real nature and perpetrators of the 9/11 crimes. The elaborate 9/11 operation itself and the subsequent cover up implicate too many powerful agencies, groups and individuals.</p>
<p>Understanding the deep corruption permeating the system over which the 9/11 culprits still rule, is changing the attitudes of many of those who have taken the time to study 9/11 for themselves. Given the unwillingness of officialdom to protect the public interest, those leading the citizens? investigation into 9/11 are increasingly inclined to name and shame the most credibly accused suspects who so far have been able to evade accountability by framing, blaming, manipulating and smearing Muslims.</p>
<p>A recent illustration of the depth of this scam is exposed in the machinations of the kangaroo court at the US concentration camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Along with four supporting actors, the supposed ?mastermind of 9/11,? the oft tortured Khalid Sheik Mohammed, is subject to the travesty of a psychological operation going forward under the guise of a legal proceeding.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Guantanamo Military Commission has been ordered to direct ultimate blame for the 9/11 debacle on a manipulated cast of patsies performing parodies of Islamic extremism. This farce of litigation, this betrayal of due process, forms a telling illustration of the degradation of our criminal justice systems. Like many other institutions essential to the survival of free and democratic societies, our criminal justice systems are being trashed to protect the real culprits responsible&amp;#160; <a href="/in-depth/899-911-scam.html" type="external">for the lies and crimes of 9/11</a>.&amp;#160; &amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bollyn.com/" type="external">The evidence available</a>&amp;#160;concerning what really transpired on 9/11 points with overwhelming insistence at individuals that include a disproportionate number of&amp;#160; <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/9-11/Israel_did_it" type="external">Israeli-American dual citizens</a>.</p>
<p>Prominent among those that should be put on trial, including for the 9/11 cover up, are Michael Chertoff, Larry Silverstein, Dov Zakheim, Richard Perle, Benjamin Netanyahu, Paul Wolfowitz, Elliot Abrams, Douglas Feith, Shalom Yoran, Arnon Milchan, Jules Kroll, Philip Zelikow, Ash Carter, Robert Gates, Ronald Lauder, William Kristol, Judge Alvin Hellerstein, Judge Michael Mukasey, Jonathan Kay, Michael Shermer, David Frum, Karl Rove, General Richard Myers, David Aaronovitch, Rupert Murdoch, Rita Katz, Daniel Pipes, David Horowitz, Pam Geller, Robert Spencer, Paul Godfrey, and, as we shall see, Noam Chomsky.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As years pass, the 9/11 cover up is becoming the central element of the 9/11 crime. The logistics of the cover up involve the manipulation of the mainstream media and other strategic institutions including our courts, schools and universities. As Howard Baker observed when reflecting on the abbreviated presidency of Richard Nixon, ?it is almost always the cover up rather than the event that causes trouble.? It is difficult to fathom the enormity of the enterprise of keeping alive the absurd Islamophobia-inducing fable of 9/11, let alone the smaller scale sequels of false flag terror events required to keep large portions of the public in constant states of fear, confusion, uncertainty, disorientation and angst.</p>
<p>A Classic Hoax of Homeric Proportions</p>
<p></p>
<p>In his presentation at the Left Forum, Kevin Barrett acknowledged his intellectual debt to the work of Barrie Zwicker, one of Canada?s most accomplished and experienced investigative journalists. Barrett and Zwicker concur that Noam Chomsky?s nonsensical interventions on 9/11 constitute an important part--- indeed, perhaps&amp;#160;the&amp;#160;single most instrumental part--- of the 9/11 cover up. If Chomsky?s adoring fans had been treated with respect and truth rather than with duplicity and lies, they might have joined together in a timely and effective way to get to the bottom of the 9/11 deception and to demand some legal and political accountability for the fraud.</p>
<p>The Left?s most influential guru, however, discouraged his obedient flock from trying to sort out 9/11 truth from the instrumentalized fiction embedded in the 9/11 fable. As the Trojan horse within the progressives? main camps, Chomsky moved decisively and deliberately to discourage independent investigations into a classic hoax of Homeric proportions.</p>
<p>World Trade Center 7 collapsed almost instantly into its own footprint late in the afternoon of September 11 twenty minutes after its destruction had been announced on the BBC.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>In New York Dr. Barrett underlined the pivotal role of Noam Chomsky as a primary agent of the 9/11 cover up. In making his point the martyred former professor referred to Building 7. WTC 7 is the third World Trade Center skyscraper in New York to be downed on 9/11 in a controlled demolition. Lucky Larry Silverstein?s World Trade Center 7 was not hit by any jet. Nevertheless, this 47-story steel-frame skyscraper collapsed almost instantly into its own footprint late in the afternoon of September 11 twenty minutes&amp;#160;after&amp;#160;its destruction had been announced on the BBC.Said Barrett, ?In November of 2001, if Chomsky had not chosen to feed us such a diet of bull shit, but instead had eloquently pushed the whole Left towards just looking at Building 7 and then drawing the obvious conclusions, I think we?d be living in a very different and vastly better world.? &amp;#160; &amp;#160;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.democracynow.org/shows/2011/9/13" type="external">Why did Noam Chomsky intervene so quickly</a>, aggressively and unrelentingly to persuade his admirers, including many teachers, politicians, jurists and journalists, to put aside their own critical faculties in evaluating the substance of what actually transpired in the most transformative event of the twenty-first century? Why did Chomsky rush into print his&amp;#160; <a href="https://books.google.de/books?id=E5NoWOUhcpYC&amp;amp;redir_esc=y" type="external">book of November 2001</a>&amp;#160;to declare ?the initial conclusions about 9/11 are presumably correct,? and to reassure that there would be no major ?long-term restriction of rights? or ?government censorship? flowing from the debacle?</p>
<p></p>
<p>In his 2006 volume entitled,&amp;#160;Towers of Deception: The Media Cover-Up of 9/11, Barrie Zwicker devotes a chapter to ?The Shame of Noam Chomsky and the Gatekeepers of the Left.? (pages 179-224) This seminal chapter was accompanied by a series of short documentaries by Snowshoe Productions now published on You Tube by Yoryvrah. Zwicker explains that he was once ?a fan, a prot?g? and a booster? of Noam Chomsky. In these print and video publications, Zwicker describes how prior to 9/11 he voraciously read many of Chomsky?s books. The investigative reporter and teacher included a number of Chomsky?s articles in the curriculum of the journalism courses he taught at Ryerson University in Toronto.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Zwicker corresponded with his former role model on a collegial basis. There exists public acknowledgment of&amp;#160; <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=JfOM2H_AbIIC&amp;amp;pg=PA228&amp;amp;lpg=PA228&amp;amp;dq=Barrie+Zwicker+Manufacturing+consent&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=oOA_LWorVX&amp;amp;sig=U3IzaJSB52gNtFNARwXlUzCOozo&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiv88Sc56LNAhVD6RQKHXKKDK8Q6AEIOTAF#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Barrie%20Zwicker%20Manufacturing%20consent&amp;amp;f=false" type="external">Zwicker?s contribution</a>&amp;#160;to the gestation process of&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Manufacturing-Consent-Political-Economy-" type="external">Manufacturing Consent</a>, Chomsky?s 1992 co-authored book accompanied by a documentary film project. The Canadian journalist interviewed Chomsky twice, once in the 1990s and the second time in Hamilton Ontario in 2002. In the second interview Chomsky responded dismissively to Zwicker?s questions on 9/11. The visiting scholar referred to critiques of the official narrative of 9/11 as ?conspiracy theories.?</p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/MANUFACTURING-CONSENT-Mark-Achbar/dp/1551640023" type="external">https://www.amazon.ca/MANUFACTURING-CONSENT-Mark-Achbar/dp/1551640023</a></p>
<p>Chomsky?s flippant reference to a notoriously engineered meme, namely his mention of ?conspiracy theories,? amounts to the purposeful deployment of a tactic aimed at blocking critical and thoughtful exchange. Chomsky?s resort to this overworked clich? caused Zwicker to begin the process of re-evaluating the work of the MIT professor. By using without irony the uncontextualized term ?conspiracy theorist?, Chomsky signaled his unwillingness to engage in open-minded dialogue on a difficult yet vital topic. Chomsky?s refusal to engage in honest evidence-based discussion about 9/11 alerted Zwicker that his US guest could sometimes be ?intellectually dishonest.? Zwicker would subsequently learn that Chomsky was not above resorting to cheap ?put down phrases? and ?bizarre non-sequiturs.? &amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Both Zwicker and Barrett are far from alone in noticing that Chomsky defends both the government narrative of 9/11 as well as the now-discredited government myth that a sole gunman acting independently killed former US President John F. Kennedy. When pressed to provide clarification on both positions Chomsky notoriously resorts to rhetorical dismissals like ?Who cares?? or ?What does it matter?? Of course it matters a great deal who did 9/11 and who killed Kennedy. A conclusive and honest answer to both questions would reveal much about how we are governed and who is really in control.</p>
<p>In&amp;#160;Towers of Deception, Zwicker deals not only with America?s most highly-publicized professor, but also with many foundation-funded alternative media that followed Chomsky?s lead in avoiding honest critical analysis of the originating events of the 9/11 Wars.</p>
<p>Among the Left Gatekeeper institutions Zwicker identifies are Amy Goodman?s&amp;#160;Democracy Now, Michael Albert?s&amp;#160;Z Magazine, David Corn?s&amp;#160;The Nation&amp;#160;and many other venues including&amp;#160;The Progressive,&amp;#160;Mother Jones&amp;#160;and&amp;#160;South End Press. In summing up his commentary on ?The Shame of Noam Chomsky,? Zwicker observed, ?When he is not appearing to undermine the American Empire, which is the main thing he does, [Chomsky] is buttressing it by undermining the most effective and therefore dangerous foe the Empire faces?the conscious Left.?</p>
<p>Zwicker asks:</p>
<p>How many could imagine that the person warning you is one of the most perilous against whom you?ll need to defend yourself? That he is the fire marshal who wires your house to burn down, the lifeguard who drowns you, the doctor with a disarming bedside manner who administers a fatal injection? If Noam Chomsky did not exist, the diaboligarchy would have to invent him. To the New World Order, he is worth 50 armored divisions. (page 224)</p>
<p>Zwicker?s comparison of Chomsky to a very large grouping of military units is striking and apt given what we now know. Ironically Chomsky made his name and fame drawing attention to the role of propaganda in manufacturing consent for war and contemporary colonization. Disinfo agent Michael Shermer has replicated this strategy of seeming to expose the very tactic he utilizes to advance the interests of power.</p>
<p>A disingenuous TV professor with a penchant for misrepresenting his limited academic credentials,&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.salem-news.com/articles/october282010/scholarship-scams-ah.php" type="external">Shermer is editor</a>&amp;#160;of the deep-state funded&amp;#160;Skeptic Magazine&amp;#160;that is anything but skeptical when it comes to addressing the lies and crimes of 9/11.</p>
<p>Inside Job? Inside What?</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>In his chapter on "Left Gatekeepers" and the "Shame of Noam Chomsky," Barrie Zwicker refers to the the ?New World Order? as the ?diaboligarchy?s? directing agency.&amp;#160;Less compelling is Zwicker?s reference to the ?New World Order? as the ?diaboligarchy?s? directing agency. To me this unfortunate choice of words is much too closely associated with the often crude and chauvinistic populism of Alex Jones and his Infowars media network. Many have come to see Jones? lucrative media operation as a limited hangout set in place by handlers trying to hold the activities of the 9/11 Truth Movement within manageable constraints.</p>
<p>Due to the important findings over fifteen years of the citizens? investigation into 9/11, the culprits most deeply implicated in the crime can be identified with much more specificity than an entity vaguely described as a ?New World Order.? As Kevin Barrett and many others insist, the time has come to name the names of the probable culprits, Noam Chomsky prominent among them.</p>
<p>While Alex Jones ultimately serves the same masters as Chomsky, the former?s media product is often much closer to the mark of what is really going on than the content of Noam Chomsky?s more magisterial pronouncements. Jones goes at least part of the way into realities of the deep state politics of the twenty-first century. Chomsky, however, sacrificed his capacity to contribute cogently to sensible discourse on contemporary geopolitics by making himself a primary instrument of the most consequential deep state deception of recent times. As a leading agent of disinformation in the psychological trenches of the ongoing Global War of False Flag Terrorism, Chomsky has reduced himself to the level of skeptic pretender Michael Shermer. In the style of Shermer, the elder Chomsky has become an establishment TV professor readily available on&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.onnetflix.ca/actor/noam-chomsky" type="external">Netflix</a>.</p>
<p>?Inside job? is another turn of phrase closely identified with Alex Jones. The term ?inside job? effectively conveys in simple language that the originators of the 9/11 crime are not Islamic jihadists acting independently. The idea of an inside job, however, begs the question about how to describe the receptacle containing this phenomenon. Is the ongoing inside job of 9/11 primarily within the box of the US government or is the receptacle larger with multiple compartments? Does this larger receptacle allow for the interpretation emphasized by Kevin Barrett, Christopher Bollyn, Alan Sabrosky and many others that insist that the primary executive oversight of the 9/11 inside job originates primarily with the partisans of Greater Israel?</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Long before 9/11, Alex Jones declared himself to be a friend and supporter of the Jewish state of Israel. In declaring his position he condemned the United Nations as Israel?s enemy. Jones? bias is reflected in his effort to deflect interpretations of the 9/11 crime away from Israel and away from the inner circle of neocon proponents of the Zio-American empire. Webster Tarpley is another early analyst of the 9/11 crimes who has kept to the interpretation outlined in his important book on the subject. As Tarpley sees it, the strikes on the WTC skyscrapers and on the Pentagon were&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/11-Synthetic-Terror-Made-USA/dp/1615771115?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;*Version*=1&amp;amp;*entries*=0" type="external">Synthetic Terror: Made in the USA</a>. Many times Tarpley has expressed his opinion that the government of Israel was not a factor in the planning of the most audacious act of ?synthetic terror? in US history.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Chomsky?s smear of the 9/11 Truth Movement follows some lines of disinformation similar to those followed by Alex Jones. From their different positions inside and outside the 9/11 Truth Movement, both Jones and Chomsky disseminate disinfo concerning the role of US President George Bush in the 9/11 crime. In reality, Bush seems to have been a marginal figure, at least in the planning phase of the 9/11operation. Did the core planners of the 9/11 crime send a signal in the title of the storybook being read by the US President to the schoolchildren in Sarasota Florida at the moment of maximum crisis?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Was Bush being labeled the 9/11 scapegoat when he was filmed on the fateful morning reading ?My Pet Goat? to the assembled students? Why did Bush continue reading from the book rather than leave the school as news of the two WTC strikes came into Booker Elementary School? Why did the US secret service not whisk the US President away at such a consequential moment of crisis? Why did Bush?s Press Secretary, Ari Fleisher, hold up a sign at the back of the classroom telling the US President in block letters, ?DON?T SAY ANYTHING YET?? Why did the US President not return immediately to Washington, as he initially wanted, but instead was taken to&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?timeline=complete_911_timeline&amp;amp;day_of_9/11=bush&amp;amp;printerfriendly=true&amp;amp;startpos=0" type="external">Barksdale Air force Base</a>&amp;#160;in Louisiana and then to Offut Air force Base in Nebraska?</p>
<p>What transpired to make Dick Cheney rather than George Bush the hands-on Commander In Chief of the US Armed Forces on the morning of 9/11? &amp;#160;What was the nature of the alleged credible threat on Air force One and who or what was behind this threat? What should we make of the conflicting testimony of Cheney and Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta concerning Cheney?s activities in the White House Bunker on the morning of 9/11?</p>

<p>Fifteen years of the 9/11 cover up has prevented us from getting clear answers to these any many other basic questions about what really happened on September 11, 2001. In this cover up Chomsky and Jones inhabit different compartments of the same elaborate system of controlled opposition in the United States. Both Jones the truther and Chomsky the anti-truther highlight the role of Bush in their 9/11 commentaries. The effect of this Bush-centric preoccupation points attention away from the main 9/11 suspects including Benjamin Netanyahu, Ehud Barack, Ehud Olmert, Richard Perle, Michael Chertoff, Paul Wolfowitz and other Israel First neocons. Their fingerprints are all over the 9/11 crime.</p>
<p>Chomsky, for instance, tries to highlight Bush in his effort to put a veil over the case of the controlled demolition of WTC 7. Its instant collapse hours after the pulverization of the Twin Towers is often characterized as the ?smoking gun? of 9/11. Chomsky seeks to minimize this most damning feature of the 9/11 evidence by putting forward cartoon-like characterizations of 9/11 Truthers. Chomsky mocks us, for instance, with bizarre non-sequiturs like the notion that we think ?Bush put the bombs in Building 7.?</p>
<p>Noam Chomsky and Zionism</p>
<p></p>
<p>Understanding of the nature of the lies and crimes of 9/11 has moved quite far in the decade between the publication of Barrie Zwicker?s Towers of Deception in 2006 and Kevin Barrett?s 2016 presentation at the Left Forum. Where Zwicker emphasized Chomsky?s connection to the US deep state, Kevin Barrett views Chomsky as a Zionist with deep attachments to Israel where he lived and worked on a kibbutz in the early 1950s.</p>
<p>Kevin Barrett views Chomsky as a Zionist with deep attachments to Israel where he lived and worked on a kibbutz in the early 1950s.</p>
<p>Chomsky?s relationship with Israel is outlined in flattering terms in a fluff piece in a publication entitled&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/50260/qa-noam-chomsky" type="external">Tablet</a>, a heavily pro-Zionist venue featuring other interviews with the likes of Elliot Abrams. Abrams was an influential member of the Project for the New American Century, the neocon lobby group that in 2000 notoriously signaled the forthcoming 9/11 strikes by calling for ?something like a new Pearl Harbor.?</p>
<p>In the&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/195183/middle-east-roundtable" type="external">Tablet</a>&amp;#160;interview, Noam Chomsky explained the attachments and preoccupations of his Jewish orthodox parents. In his seminal years, Hebrew was the main language of the Chomsky family, a linguistic asset that the younger Chomsky would later call upon in his career as a student of linguistics.</p>
<p>Noam Chomsky?s father pointed his son towards the writings of Jewish philosopher Ahad Ha?am. Chomsky looked back fondly on his father?s account of Ha?am?s advocacy of ?a Zionist revival in Israel, in Palestine.? The aim of this revival would be to create ?a cultural center for the Jewish people.? Chomsky elaborates, explaining Ha?am?s view that ?Jews as primarily a Diaspora community needed a cultural center that has a physical presence. Ha?am was said to be very sympathetic to the Palestinians.? Ha?am wanted kindly treatment of the Palestinians but he left no doubt that they should move aside to make room for what Chomsky refers to again and again as a ?Jewish cultural center.?</p>
<p>In the Tablet article Chomsky?s orientation towards Israel is publicly portrayed as that of a loyalist calling for a kinder gentler form of Zionism. As Kevin Barrett sees it, however, Chomsky?s willingness to criticize the Israeli state, but especially its abuses and assaults directed at the Palestinian people, should not be allowed to take away from understanding that he is a committed Zionist intent on protecting and advancing Israel?s interests.</p>
<p>Chomsky?s position on 9/11 has been replicated throughout much of the Left where well-funded gatekeeping, sponsored by the likes of George Soros? Open Society Foundation, is indeed rife. There is a conspicuous absence of leading Jewish intellectuals that have publicly attempted to decipher what actually transpired in New York, Washington and the air lanes of northeastern United States during the transformative day of September 11, 2001. Consider, for instance, the relationship of&amp;#160; <a href="/author.html?id=890" type="external">Miko Peled</a>, Medea Benjamin, Michael Albert, David Corn, Amy Goodman George Monbiot, Cy Gonick, Judy Rebick to the enterprise of exposing the lies and crimes of 9/11. Their evasiveness or outright hostility to the 9/11 skeptics is shared by many non-Jewish public intellectuals including Chris Hedges, John Pilger, and Tariq Ali.</p>
<p>Some, but especially Chomsky, have gone beyond maintaining a strategic silence to incite smear campaigns against those that have displayed skepticism towards the official narrative of 9/11. Chomsky sets the bar low in portraying the demeaned ?truthers? as an undifferentiated collection of stupid, backward and decrepit souls. ?Their lives are no good? Their lives are collapsing?They are people at a loss? Nothing makes any sense? They don?t understand what an explanation is? They think they are experts in physics and civil engineering on the basis of one hour on the Internet.?</p>
<p></p>
<p>These comments reflect the shockingly low level of Chomsky?s near hysterical effort to divert attention away from evidence of what really transpired on 9/11. This type of personalized attack, as if the 9/11 Truth Movement is collectively guilty of some sort of horrific thought crime, replicates on ideological grounds some of the worst attributes of racism and bigotry.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Chomsky?s interventions are fairly representative of the overall quality of many Zionist attacks on the 9/11 Truth Movement.&amp;#160; As is especially clear in the writings of Jonathan Kay, for instance, Zionist smear tactics directed at 9/11 ?truthers? extend many of the same themes of induced hatred directed at Muslims by the Zionist propagandists in charge of the Islamophobia Industry.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;Chomsky?s critical orientation to the actions and power structure of the Israeli government is similar to his critical orientation to the actions and power structure of the United States. Chomsky?s bottom line, however, is his attachment to the Jewish state as the site of a Jewish cultural renaissance that he seeks to advance and protect.</p>
<p>Chomsky refuses to accept that US foreign policy and the foreign policies of the former dependencies of Anglo-American empire have become subordinate to the imperatives of Zionist lobbies as well as to the networks of media, banking and corporate power that serve them. These lobbies figure prominently in the formulation and execution of the Israeli government?s foreign policies. Organizations like the B?nai Brith or Abe Foxman?s thuggish Anti-Defamation League are in reality ideological and political proxy armies. Their role is to silence critics of the Israeli government, to brand as anti-semitic any efforts to identify fundamental disparities in access to power.</p>
<p>All these factors converge to expose Chomsky?s role in serving the dominant clique that emerged from the global coup d'?tat of September 11, 2001. Chomsky?s power-serving misrepresentations on this subject present an important window into the study of the relationship between 9/11 and the structuring of national and global hierarchies of power. What is the role of universities and the media in the connections linking 9/11 to the Zionist Question, a contemporary extension of what Karl Marx and others used to refer to frequently in European literature as the Jewish Question?</p>
<p>A Public Intellectual Outside the Protections of the Academy</p>
<p></p>
<p>Not one aspect of the officially authorized account of 9/11 has been able to withstand the test of close scrutiny by the best of the citizen investigators in the 9/11 Truth Movement. The crude vacuity of the ongoing 9/11 cover up can be seen as powerful evidence that many of our governors have much to hide about their own roles in the lies and crimes of 9/11 and in the subsequent onslaughts of state terror to which the original misrepresentations gave rise.</p>
<p>The persecution of Kevin Barrett in 2006 for doing his job as a conscientious Islamic Studies teacher can be seen in retrospect as telling evidence of government and media collusion in the 9/11 crime. The unfolding of this dark episode involving a devastating betrayal of academic integrity in the Wisconsin heartland of America helps expose those who have the most to lose if the real culprits of 9/11 were to be identified.</p>
<p>Eventually the University of Wisconsin caved in to the pressure from the enemies of academic freedom. Because Dr. Barrett lost his job, the University of Wisconsin lost much respect among those that genuinely seek to safeguard the fragile institutional foundations on which free and democratic societies depend. Academic institutions where the protections of academic tenure are genuinely earned, honored and defended, frequently form a last line for the defense of truth.</p>
<p>The fragile rules and procedures essential to the exercise of academic freedom are meant to form primary mechanisms in the age-old quest to distinguish what is real from what is false. What is the purpose of universities once they abandon their higher mission as identifiers, custodians and protectors of truth? Are universities worthy of respect once they become mere agencies for the advancement of the political agendas of dominant interests?</p>
<p>In the paradigmatic case instigated by the truth telling of Dr. Kevin Barrett, a major American university found itself in the maelstrom of controversy over how 9/11 should be interpreted. Rather than signal its capacity to host such a vital and necessary task of drawing truth from a refereed reading of both real or connived ?facts,? the University of Wisconsin embraced the rule of politics over the rule of academic integrity. When put to the test, the U of W?s administration as well as its Faculty Association failed to defend the crucial capacity of qualified faculty to express themselves freely on subjects of great political sensitivity.</p>
<p>Rather than leave the realm of intellectual controversy, Dr. Barrett became a pioneer in alternative Internet broadcasting, the main site of his&amp;#160;Truth jihad. For many years Dr. Barrett has covered on his&amp;#160;Truth jihad&amp;#160;media network every twist and turn in the gradual coming to light of the truth of 9/11 and many related issues, episodes and personalities connected to the Mother of All False Flag Events. Dr. Barrett has sought out and interviewed thousands of significant newsmakers whose importance might otherwise have been kept hidden. He has lectured widely including at universities in Turkey, Morocco and Iran on a wide array of subjects encompassed within his many fields of academic and journalistic expertise.</p>
<p>In this fashion Dr. Barrett has helped to expose the huge truth deficit of mainstream media (MSM) venues. By and large these venues and their agents of deception and distraction have abandoned any pretenses of doing investigative reporting worthy of the name. Rather than speaking truth to power they most often become servants of power acting primarily as obedient stenographers for officialdom.</p>
<p>By going where the MSM won?t go, Dr. Barrett has helped clarify the extent of the dishonesty and obfuscation of a thoroughly corrupted communications industry that includes public broadcasters such as the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. More often than not these agencies of mass communications subordinate the public interest and the common good to the war agendas of the military-industrial complex.</p>
<p>In the decade since Dr. Barrett was purged from the academy, he has created a record of great importance exposing on a day-by-day basis significant breaking news. The books, articles and digital archives of his extensive media work have already become major primary sources concerning many strategic developments in our rapidly changing world. Dr. Barrett?s prolific contributions to the record of our life and times during an era set in motion by the fraudulent interpretation of 9/11 are destined to outlive the mortal existences of the generation that came of age in the 1970s and 80s.</p>
<p>Dr. Barrett?s prodigious journalistic output is often leavened by satire containing copious quantities of parody, paradox and biting irony. Barrett has also continued to publish academic works including two recent edited volumes assessing the distance between media hype and reality in the&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/ANOTHER-French-False-Flag-Bernardino/dp/0996143017" type="external">two violent episodes in Paris in 2015</a>.&amp;#160; As on 9/11, both Paris events were instantly characterized without objective investigation as the demented deeds of self-directed Islamic extremists acting independently. I authored articles in both these volumes as part of my collaboration with a persecuted Muslim colleague.</p>
<p>Kevin Barrett continues to bring to the New Media of the Internet a cornucopia of topics that should be freely and openly debated in our universities but, by and large, are not. Our institutions of higher learning are thereby failing some of the core principles that university faculty members, including Prof. Chomsky and I, are charged to serve and defend.</p>
<p>As I see it this article here forms a part of my best effort to rise to the high responsibility invested in tenured professors to safeguard the academic integrity of universities.</p>
<p>In my view Dr. Chomsky has fallen far short of the ideals he espoused in 1967 when he called for ?intellectuals to speak the truth and expose lies.? In his early days Professor Chomsky was himself the target of attacks on his democratic right and academic responsibility to articulate truths often inconvenient to power. How did he survive those professional and political attacks? Certainly part of the answer lies in Chomsky?s own erudition, eloquence, tenacity, and a prodigious level of research and publication during his most robust years.</p>
<p>Kevin Barrett, however, has displayed similar qualities working intelligently and tirelessly against the many obstructions put up by an elaborate machinery that might be characterized as the&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2016/01/02/the-academys-complicity-in-the-global-war-of-false-flag-terrorism/" type="external">9/11 Cover Up Industry</a>. The 9/11 Cover Up Industry can be seen as part of a large propaganda-military-industrial complex whose elements also include what Norman Finkelstein labeled The Holocaust Industry and what David Miller and others have described as the Islamophobia Industry.</p>
<p>In spite of all that has been thrown against him, Dr. Barrett has for the last decade worked with courage and great internal resolve to expose the workings of false flag terrorism, including the events of 9/11. He has done so without the safety, security and access to resources that are supposed to come with academic appointments. It is not a big stretch to speculate that there are some hidden factors at play in the disparity of treatment afforded Chomsky and Barrett by universities. Advertising themselves as institutions of higher learning, these institutions are unfortunately sometimes not the paragons of peer review and meritocracy they are supposed to be.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A recent example of the propensity of some universities to abandon the high ground of protected academic freedom lies in the contested efforts of Florida Atlantic University to fire the tenured Communications Professor James Tracy. Tracy is facing severe professional recriminations for exposing many of the frauds permeating the&amp;#160; <a href="https://memoryholeblog.com/about-disclaimer/" type="external">Sandy Hook false flag school shooting</a>&amp;#160;event in Connecticut in 2012.</p>
<p>One of the consequences of evading any formal procedures to deal with the lies and crimes of 9/11 is the frequency of successor events to keep the fear of Islamic terrorism alive. Dr. Barrett has applied his expertise in false flag terrorism to immediate assessments of the engineered violence brought by the 9/11 culprits to London, Madrid, Bali, Ottawa, Sydney, San Bernardino, Brussels, Orlando, and Dhaka. In&amp;#160;The Terror Factory: Inside the FBI?s Manufactured War on Terrorism, Trevor Aaronson has demonstrated the domestic side of this transnational genre of psychological operation.</p>
<p>Noam Chomsky, Kevin Barrett and Academic Freedom</p>
<p><a href="/opinion/1119-public-intellectual.html" type="external"></a></p>
<p>Noam Chomsky has been much worse than hypocritical in the role he has chosen for himself in the study of 9/11. Chomsky treats the subject of 9/11 as if he?s some sort of master of analysis on the subject of what happened. He presents his conclusions without showing the due diligence of going through the relevant primary and secondary sources in a balanced and scholarly fashion. The primary sources Chomsky chooses to disregard include passenger lists, video and photographic evidence in the public domain, eyewitness accounts, original news coverage on the day of 9/11 and the like.</p>
<p>It seems that Noam Chomsky was well aware of Kevin Barrett?s case. Without naming either Barrett or the University of Wisconsin, Chomsky alludes to the matter in a video of an interview posted in 2011 on the You Tube channel of RPShredow. The item is entitled ?Noam Chomsky Discusses 9/11 Conspiracy Theories.? The interviewer is Michael Albert. Chomsky?s comments begin with his observation that somewhere between a third and a half of all Americans ascribe to some version of the interpretations brought forward by the 9/11 Truth Movement. Chomsky then tries to alter a perceptual trend that he clearly does not like.</p>
<p>This very revealing and important video captures a low point in Professor Chomsky?s career. The manager of the You Tube channel on which the item appears has removed the comments section reporting that the eliminated responses were mostly from ?the dumbest, annoyingest fucktards ever.? The unspoken message of this exorcism of dissenting voices is that it is acceptable to obliterate the remarks of those that dare criticize Chomsky?s position on 9/11.</p>
<p>The evidence of the specific nature of the detractors? disagreements with Chomsky is eliminated, presumably by someone close to Chomsky, possibly even the unnamed interviewer himself. Much like those that throw up the ?conspiracy theorist? label to evade the give-and-take of constructive dialogue, the self-appointed thought police in this case replace a critical exchange of ideas with a smear job calculated to demean and create hatred towards an identifiable group. &amp;#160;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>&amp;#160;In the body of the video Chomsky exudes a remarkably aggressive outpouring of slander and vituperation against the broad array of individuals that have genuinely investigated the lies and crimes of 9/11. As part of this diatribe Chomsky refers to ?some guy, who instead of teaching his courses taught about this stuff [9/11] and therefore wasn?t rehired, which is normal.? Chomsky?s prior knowledge of the details of the case to which he refers is well evidenced in a published&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2013/11/05/chomsky-emails/" type="external">E-Mail exchange</a>&amp;#160;he conducted with Dr. Barrett in 2008.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>After introducing the Barrett case, a matter of which Chomsky knows much more than he lets on, the MIT professor then flips backwards in more ways than one. He reminisces that he himself ?once taught courses on this kind of stuff but in my spare time.? Chomsky gives no explanation of the obvious contradiction between his blanket condemnations of those that study 9/11 and his recollection that he used to teach classes on similar subjects.</p>
<p>Chomsky indicates&amp;#160;that he himself would have been fired too had he criticized the official 9/11 narrative.</p>
<p>What courses did Chomsky teach in his spare time? What subjects did he decide to relegate to spare time studies? What is Chomsky?s rationale for decreeing that skeptical perspectives on the official narrative of 9/11 do not belong in the curriculum of courses other than those he would assign to spare time studies? Chomsky concludes this important segment on 9/11 and the role of universities by indicating that he himself would have been fired too had he acted like the unnamed ?guy? he?s accusing. ?You have some duties at the University,? implying Kevin Barrett did not perform them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Chomsky badly misrepresents the Barrett case by indicating the university instructor in question--- ?some guy?--- abandoned his responsibilities to teach the full curriculum. He accuses Barrett of devoting all his pedagogical energy to the sole subject of 9/11. As demonstrated by the outcome U of W?s internal investigation of this controversy, nothing of the sort happened. Dr. Barrett was found to be conscientious in integrating various perspectives on 9/11 into a much larger multi-faceted survey of Islam, both historically and in contemporary times. The senior academic thus smears the more junior academic, disregarding altogether the best documentary evidence of what happened in the classroom during the teaching of the course in question, namely Dr. Barrett?s offering of&amp;#160;Islam: Religion and Culture.</p>
<p>By commenting as he did on a significant precedent-setting case, Dr. Chomsky aligns himself with those that intervened politically to cut short Dr. Barrett?s promising academic career. By acting as an opponent of the principle that the events of 9/11 present a vital subject for legitimate academic research and debate in our universities, Dr. Chomsky demonstrated he is no friend of academic freedom. He does not support the underlying principles that provided him with his own position of academic security from which to develop his oft contested ideas and theories.</p>
<p>The video?s content helps to reaffirm the significance of Barrie Zwicker?s seminal assessment of ?Noam Chomsky?s Shame? in&amp;#160;Towers of Deception&amp;#160;in 2006. Moreover, it helps substantiate many of the allegations made by Kevin Barrett in his Left Forum presentation, ?Why Chomsky Is Wrong on 9/11.? Chomsky?s frontal attack on the 9/11 Truth Movement should bring to the surface longstanding questions about the underlying motivations of America?s most highly publicized university professor.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;Truth and Public Policy in the Digital Age</p>
<p><a href="/opinion/1127-academic-freedom.html" type="external"></a></p>
<p>In a style much like that of disinformation agents Michael Shermer, Jonathan Kay and David Aaronvitch, Chomsky casts a generalizing net of his own imagination over the diverse array of critics that skeptically interrogate officialdom?s specious account of 9/11. One of the most bizarre of Chomsky?s generalizations is that those who are skeptical of the official interpretation of 9/11 are united by a common delusion that we can become experts in physics and civil engineering on the basis of an hour on the Internet.</p>
<p>Chomsky?s ?bizarre non-sequitur? on the Internet and 9/11 ?truthers? is at odds with the characterization put forward by another avid defender of the official narrative of 9/11. Jonathan Hillel Kay?s proudly-proclaimed Jewish approach to interpreting 9/11 presents a reverse version of the negative spin that Noam Chomsky gives the Internet in relation to the 9/11 Truth Movement. &amp;#160;Where Chomsky sees ?truthers? as a human type prone to abuse the Internet in order to arrive at conclusions too quickly, Kay attacks the 9/11 Truth Movement by associating it with ?Internet addiction.? Are Chomsky and Kay delivering talking points emanating from a common source that has identified the ?Internet? as a hot button term useful in casting aspersions on those to be attacked?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Whatever the case, there is no denying that the age of the Internet has made it possible for diverse individuals to interact in new types of configuration in the digital commons. This change in our primary mode of communication is eroding many former monopolies of power. The citizens? investigation of the events of September 11, 2001 forms a classic case in point. Since 2001 the Internet has become the primary medium of convergence of millions of people sharing a common interest in holding the real culprits of 9/11 accountable for their international crimes. &amp;#160;</p>
<p>The rise of the 9/11 Truth Movement through digital communication forms a primary test of the implications of New Media in formulating twenty-first century public policy. When, if ever, will the weight of Internet disclosures swing the pendulum of power away from fable-based formulations towards evidence-based formulations of public policy on the big issues of war and peace, life and death? How much longer can the war footing of so many Western governments be maintained as millions of citizens become aware of the specious nature of justifications for military aggressions abroad, police state incursions at home? How much longer can the empire of illusion be maintained in an era of massive disclosures through Internet venues such as those through which Kevin Barrett spreads the fruits of his intellectual roots?</p>
<p>Kevin Barrett?s continuing career as a public intellectual&amp;#160;would have been difficult to imagine without the Internet. Alternatively many of those that have lined up to insult Dr. Barrett?s work embody the old bastions of power that formerly operated through control of information. The mutual contempt of Jonathan Kay and Noam Chomsky for the intellectual work of Kevin Barrett forms a telling example of a convergence of hostility towards an individual whose career well illustrates the role of the Internet in breaking down old monopolies of academic and journalistic authority.</p>
<p>Mixing Fact and Fiction in the Literature&amp;#160;of the Global War on Terror</p>
<p>The concept of ?Internet Addicts? comes up in the subtitle of&amp;#160;Among the Truthers, Kay?s volume authored to commemorate the 10th anniversary of 9/11. By his own self-admission in a written communication to me, Kay is a notorious ?poseur? who posed the part in this well-funded project as that of a sleuthing anthropologist turning up stones and slithering along murky caves in search of objects for his subterranean study. In the subtitle Kay advertises his text as&amp;#160;A Journey into the Growing Conspiracist Underground of 9/11 Truthers, Birthers, Armageddonites, Vaccine Hysterics, Hollywood Know-Nothings, and Internet Addicts.</p>
<p>Although he would subsequently try to distance himself from the episode, I personally witnessed Jonathan Kay cite Noam Chomsky approvingly in Montreal in 2009. After Richard Gage?s talk on behalf of Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth, Kay publicly aligned himself with&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.commentarymagazine.com/culture-civilization/noam-chomskys-monomanical-antiamericanism/" type="external">Chomsky?s hostility to the 9/11 Truth Movement</a>. Kay?s work on&amp;#160;Among the Truthers&amp;#160;was supported by the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, an entity that extended the author a fellowship. The FDD is a richly funded Zionist lobby and think tank created three days after 9/11.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>The FDD receives financial support from a number of Jewish family philanthropies. Many such estates are heavily committed to funding the various entities that work with the media such as the Rupert Murdoch Press, the BBC, the New York Times and the Postmedia newspaper chain in Canada to generate images and circulate stories meant to incite maximum fear and hate of Muslims.</p>
<p>With especially close connections to the&amp;#160;New York Times, Rita Katz?s SITE Intelligence agency is an important Zionist entity at the strategic nexus between the media incitement of Islamophobia and the national security state?s Gladio-style engineering of false flag terrorism. The aim of this elaborate system of violence, publicity and deception is to shape public opinion in ways that facilitate Israel-directed war strategies through agencies that include NATO and the US Armed Forces.</p>

<p>The influence in high places of the&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/religion/report/2015/02/11/106394/fear-inc-2-0/" type="external">hate-inducing</a>&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/who-are-millionaires-behind-islamophobic-industry-america-1487378765" type="external">Islamophobia Industry</a>&amp;#160;is marked by the fact that there is a virtual absence of skeptical investigation and reporting in the mainstream media when it comes to events where police and government officials blame terror events on&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.islamophobiatoday.com/2014/04/16/latent-and-manifest-islamophobia-an-inception-of-ideas/" type="external">Islamic extremists</a>. Reporters are reduced to the status of mere stenographers for police and other public officials. As we have seen, many in the foundation-funded ?alternative media? follow suit, betraying their mandate to evaluate official pronouncements honestly and skeptically.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
<p><a href="http://cryptome.org/rad.htm" type="external">The engineering of false flag terrorist events</a>&amp;#160;and the media coverage of them are part of the same dark psychological operation. This psy-op brings together the likes of Noam Chomsky and Jonathan Kay, two public intellectuals seemingly at different poles of the political spectrum. Kay?s sponsor, the FDD, draws on much the same Zionist circles of interest as did the Project for the New American Century. A year before 9/11, PNAC?s Israeli-American brain trust notoriously observed that its agenda of rapid militarization of the US Armed Forces could not be quickly achieved ?absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event - like a new Pearl Harbor.? [1]</p>
<p>Kay?s other book-length project is a mixture of fact and fiction co-authored with Michael Ross aka Michael Burrows. Ross worked with Jonathan Kay at the&amp;#160;National Post&amp;#160;doing stories including on the 9/11 research work of my former graduate student,&amp;#160; <a href="/author.html?id=956" type="external">Joshua Blakeney</a>. The literary style of the book-length Kay-Ross collaboration marries snippets of truth with much fabrication, invention, exaggeration and adornment. The text provides something of a prototype to be replicated and adapted in the supposed news coverage of the Global War on Terror in its many incarnations.</p>
<p>Entitled&amp;#160;The Volunteer: A Canadian?s Secret Life in the Mossad, the volume was written apparently with some authorization from the real Mossad. The text is written as Ross? autobiography focusing on the years he is said to have spent as an agent in the Israeli secret service. Kay lends his literary skills to lionizing the Michael Ross character. Presented as a Jewish convert and Israeli patriot, Ross [Burrows] is said to have been born and raised an Anglican in Victoria BC. As depicted in&amp;#160;The Volunteer, the Ross character is made to combine the suave knowhow of James Bond with the gutsy bravado of Rambo. The main part of the heavily contrived narrative of the good Canadian Mossad agent unfolds during the decade between the Cold War and the origination of the Global War on Terror in the misrepresented events of 9/11.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kay?s embrace of Zionism is considerably less muted than Chomsky?s. The story co-authored by the Canadian journalist begins and ends with a plea to embrace Israel as the essential shield against ?militant Islam,? as the necessary bulwark of the rule of law and of civilization itself. The co-authors proclaim, ?Israel?s battle is everyone?s battle.? Thus ?Jew and gentile alike? should be joined in ?Israel?s cause? because the Jewish state presents ?a microcosm of the civilized world?s struggle against a murderous ideology and the men who embrace it.? As Kay and his real or imagined Mossad colleague would have it, the events of 9/11 demonstrate that we are ?in a high stakes war that pits civilization against a fascistic death cult.? [1]</p>
<p>In&amp;#160;Among The Truthers&amp;#160;Kay repeats the core idea of&amp;#160;The Volunteer. As Kay would have it, 9/11 confirms the role of Israel as the West?s primary bulwark against Islamic savagery. In making this case Kay repeats the assertion of Benjamin Netanyahu that 9/11 was good for Israel. Kay asserts, ?Following the attacks supporters of Israel spoke of a silver lining. The war against militant Islam suddenly was a global one. Now the whole world would see and understand the sort of nihilistic hatred that Israelis confront every day.? As Kay sees it, Jews are being enlisted en masse to serve as primary soldiers in a war of civilizations. He writes, ?The Jew was the perfect anti-Islamist, whose zeal and reliability was hard-wired into his political DNA thanks to six decades of Israeli warfare against Islamic terrorists in the Middle East.?

<p>Jonathan Kay and the Israel First Movement</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jonathan Kay began his literary career in 1998 as a founding member of the editorial board of Canada?s&amp;#160;National Post. Kay worked under Conrad Black and his Israeli-American partner, Richard Perle. Perle was an executive member of the advisory board of Black?s Hollinger International, which oversaw one of the world?s largest English-language newspaper chains based in North America, Great Britain and Israel. A main objective of Hollinger Inc.?s Canadian flagship, the&amp;#160;National Post, was to push the country?s political culture far enough rightward that the Christian Zionist politician, Stephen Harper, could take the reigns of the federal government. Canadian Prime Minister between 2006 and 2015, Harper swept into power riding the wave of political fervor originating in the 9/11 psychological operation.</p>

<p>Richard Perle is sometimes referred to as the Prince of Darkness. He is a frequent and unabashed proponent of ?total war.? Perle was a PNAC member and lead author of the ?Clean Break? document that in 1996 encouraged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to move away from negotiations with the Palestinians toward a more militant posture in the Middle East and globally. Quite likely Perle had a significant role in planning the 9/11 event.</p>

<p>After the Bush administration was delivered its new Pearl Harbor on September 11, 2001, Perle renewed his call for ?total war.? In advancing this agenda, Perle helped lead the charge resulting in the US and UK-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Along with David Frum, another Canadian neocon spin doctor deeply implicated in the lies and crimes of 9/11, Perle co-authored the propaganda text,&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/End-Evil-How-Win-Terror/dp/0345477170" type="external">An End to Evil: How to Win the War on Terror</a>. One of the book?s key recommendations was for the United States to invade the Islamic Republic of Iran. Going back to his role in the formulation of the ?Clean Break? document, Perle had long advocated the invasion of Iran as well as Iraq and Syria in his capacity as an influential adviser within Israel?s Netanyahu government.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In looking back in 2014 at his sixteen years at the&amp;#160;National Post, Kay emphasized that his work on 9/11 infused his literary career with a ?sense of purpose.? For a lot of ?conservative pundits?this was our Spanish Civil War. The fate of Western Civilization was at stake.? Kay continues, ?I became obsessed with 9/11. I read the Koran, hoping to gain insights into Osama Bin Laden?s mindset, travelled to conferences in Israel, joined a Washington, D.C.-based think tank devoted to protecting democratic countries from terrorism. [Foundation for the Defense of Democracies] I helped a former Mossad agent [Michael Ross] write his memoir, and then wrote a book about 9/11 conspiracy theories.? [4]</p>
<p>If Jonathan Kay?s journalistic crusade is conceived as his equivalent to fighting in the Spanish Civil War between 1936 and 1939, his position on 9/11 puts him on the side of the Falangists, on the side of Francisco Franco?s right-wing nationalist forces. As clearly displayed in the ultra-Zionist content of&amp;#160;Among The Truthers&amp;#160;and&amp;#160;The Volunteer&amp;#160;as well as his frequent columns in the&amp;#160;National Post, Kay is an extreme nationalist whose highest priority is to advance the imperial reach of the Jewish state centered in the expansionary polity of Israel. Kay seems surprisingly candid in identifying himself as a partisan journalist spinning propaganda for the Israel First faction that now prevails inside the governing elites that rule Canada, the United States and all the NATO countries.</p>
<p>The Underground Asylum Imagined by Jonathan Kay</p>
<p>The difference between Noam Chomsky and Jonathan Kay in dealing with Kevin Barrett?s 9/11 work helps illuminate the complex dynamics of a many-faceted cover up campaign. Kay?s&amp;#160;Among The Truthers, for instance, is based largely on detailed ad hominem attacks on those that do not accept the official narratives he seeks to advance and defend.&amp;#160; Chomsky on the other hand avoids any reference to scholarship of those that have critically evaluated the evidence of what did or did not happen on 9/11. This treatment of his intellectual opponents as unworthy even of named recognition is made very clear in his failure to identify Dr. Barrett and his qualifications even as the MIT professor accused the former University of Wisconsin Lecturer of academic wrongdoing.</p>
<p>In&amp;#160;Among The Truthers, Kay?s sponsors assigned him the task of developing the primary commemorative text created with an eye to maintaining Zionist control over the MSM discourse that would mark the tenth anniversary of 9/11. The task given Kay in the prelude to the commemorate events in 2011 was to extend the meme of ?9/11 conspiracy theories? into new extremes of deceit and obfuscation through fear mongering, defamation, misrepresentation and guilt-by-association.</p>
<p>The text?s title well encapsulates the core features of the smear campaign that is so central to the strategy of preventing the public from realizing how severely and systematically we have been lied to. Kay?s fervid literary invention of a ?Growing Conspiracist Underground of 9/11 Truthers? was meant to invoke connotations of darkness, dementia and concealment. Among the engineered mental pictures conjured up by the literary reference to a ?Conspiracist Underground? are concocted media memes of Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda network supposedly coordinating international havoc from elaborate networks of Eurasian terrorist caves.&amp;#160;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Chomsky and Kay and the other 9/11 obfuscators consistently avoid dealing with the evidence. There is never any discussion, for instance, of the US government?s position that a catastrophic failure of intelligence flows, together with a complete breakdown of a whole series of emergency measure procedures, was the main cause of the 9/11 debacle. This narrative line is called into question by the fact that not one of the officials supposedly responsible for this alleged failure of intelligence and national defense was so much as reprimanded let alone fired. If the official narrative was true, why is it that the supposed incompetents actually received promotions?</p>
<p>There is never any effort to address huge anomalies like the fact, for instance, that the black boxes from the weaponized jet planes could not be found and yet passports of the alleged hijackers were miraculously located amidst the debris. There is never any real reckoning on the side of the obfuscators with the ongoing and blatantly illegal destruction of the forensic evidence of the 9/11 crimes.</p>
<p>This process starts under Michael Chertoff in his capacity as the person responsible for the US Justice Department?s criminal investigation of 9/11. Under Chertoff?s guidance this federal ?investigation? quickly assumed the character of a&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.911truth.org/911-victims-remains-disposed-of-in-landfill/" type="external">federally orchestrated cover up</a>. The destruction of evidence begins with the unseemly haste in the autumn of 2001 to dispose of the steel remnants of the three pulverized WTC towers. The twisted steel girders were quickly removed and sold off to scrap metal customers in China without prior forensic testing for signs of controlled demolitions. The quick destruction of evidence included the removal and destruction of human remains.</p>
<p>The saga of federal destruction of the evidence of the 9/11 crime, including the illegal destruction of the taped evidence of CIA torture in secret black site dungeons, extends to the proceedings currently underway in the Guantanamo Bay concentration camp. There, the military trial being pressed against the supposed ? <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/us/evidence-in-khalid-shaikh-mohammed-9-11-case.html?_r=0" type="external">mastermind of 9/11</a>? broke down in May of 2016 because a military judge improperly allowed the destruction of state evidence.</p>
<p>Kay?s excuse for not dealing with the evidence in&amp;#160;Among The Truthers&amp;#160;is to cite the supposed advice of a supposed New York editor who supposedly cautioned him, ?debunking books don?t sell? Conspiracy theorists won?t believe you. And normal people don?t need to be told what you?re telling them. So you have no audience.? The implication here is that somehow ?normal people? need not be burdened with knowledge of the evidentiary substance of what really happened. (p.320)</p>
<p>Kay effectively destroys his journalistic credibility with this startling declaration that he ignored the 9/11 evidence due to the marketing advice of his New York editor. From this very compromised position of surrender to the vagaries of media salesmanship, Kay launches into his pop psychology fakery profiling the inhabitants of his imagined underground realm. Those ?conspiracists? that the author chooses to highlight are simply wrong because Jonathan Kay declares them to be wrong. No proof required. All those that have developed interpretations that do not conform with the Israeliocentric worldview of Jonathan Kay and his publishers in the Rupert Murdoch media empire are simply swept aside as members of ?cults and cult-like movements.? (p.315)</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Kay?s invented realm are pronounced by their Inquisitor to be heretics and worse. Kay declares them to be common victims of an ?incurable disease? against which young people require ?inoculation? through the introduction of special curricula and programs in schools. In taking on the personae of a public health official charged to protect our youth from the spread of infectious conspiracy theories, is Kay, the self-proclaimed poseur, implicitly prescribing the quarantining of those with whom he disagrees?</p>
<p>9/11 Crimes and Israel</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jonathan Kay?s designation of ?conspiracists? as victims of an ?incurable disease? marks a dramatic low point in the history of North American journalism. This abuse of language and people with the aim of stoking up fear and hatred is on a par with Kay?s malicious characterization of 9/11 as a crime of Islam (p. 167). As discussed below, Kay made this astonishing slur of a major world religion and all its two billion adherents in the context of his condemnation of Muslim academic Kevin Barrett.</p>
<p>Obviously the crimes of 9/11 were not the crimes of any religion. They were crimes committed by many individuals whose actions were well orchestrated by a powerful directing hand. The intention was to achieve a complex array of immediate and long-term objectives. The immensely complex and sophisticated 9/11 operation could not have been achieved without the involvement of state, military and corporate protagonists.</p>
<p>The great mass of evidence points to the engineering of the 9/11 crimes by partisans of Likudnik Israel.</p>
<p>Certainly the elaborate 9/11 crime could not be the work of a small band of Muslim extremists acting independently to cut through the most formidable national defense apparatus ever assembled with the quixotic hope of creating a worldwide Islamic caliphate. That interpretation is as absurd as it is insulting to the intelligence of rational human beings still capable of independent thought.</p>
<p>The peddling of this concocted myth of Islamic culpability for the crimes of 9/11 represents a monumental case study in the systematic defrauding of the public. Those like Jonathan Kay who advance and defend the religious fable of 9/11 as a crime of Islam are deeply implicated in the work of a ruthless criminal cabal whose top priority seems to be to advance the imperialist agenda of Greater Israel, Eretz Israel. The great mass of evidence points to the engineering of the 9/11 crimes by partisans of Likudnik Israel. Since 2001, they seem to have succeeded in significantly expanding Zionist influence over the course of global geopolitics by manufacturing a new transnational enemy for the military-industrial complex of the post-Soviet West.</p>
<p>In my view there is no other logical way of viewing the 9/11 event in terms of the forensic evidence of whose fingerprints are most evident all over the 9/11crime scene. This 9/11 crime scene is ultimately global in extent, even as its antecedents stretch far back into history, but particularly the history of Israel?s current ruling party led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The roots of Netanyahu?s Likud Party lie in Revisionist Zionism, the faction of Israel?s founders most intent on expanding Israel?s boundaries eastward to the Euphrates River. This plan of territorial expansion to create Greater Israel, Eretz Israel, remains integral to the aspirations of Israel?s current ruling coalition.</p>
<p>Through Irgun and the Stern Gang, the proponents of a Greater Israel mounted very calculated acts of heavily publicized terrorism, including at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem in 1946. The Jewish terrorists? immediate goal was to push the British government to withdraw from its mandate to govern Palestine. Once the playing of the terrorism card proved successful in forcing the British out of Palestine, the way was opened for the creation of the Jewish State of Israel in 1947 and 1948. Drawing on the ideas of his father as one of the originators of Revisionist Zionism, Benjamin Netanyahu himself has been a major theorist on the subject of how to play the terrorism card in global geopolitics. Netanyahu?s basic approach is readily apparent from the title of his oft republished book,&amp;#160; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Terrorism-How-West-Can-Win/dp/0380703211" type="external">Terrorism: How the West Can Win</a>.&amp;#160;The book?s genesis goes back to the hosting by the&amp;#160; <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Jerusalem_Conference_on_International_Terrorism" type="external">Netanyahu family</a>&amp;#160;of the&amp;#160; <a href="http://911blogger.com/news/2007-07-28/1979-birth-year-international-terrorism" type="external">Jerusalem Conference on International Terrorism in 1979</a>.</p>
<p>If the true culprits of 9/11 are ever to be brought to trial, Jonathan Kay?s overzealous promotion of the 9/11 religious fable, like Netanyahu?s published work on terrorism, offers valuable evidence for the prosecution. So too can Chomsky?s interventions on 9/11 be pictured in a similar light.</p>
<p>Kay in particular violates all tenets of civil debate with his rhetorical extremes. Especially reprehensible are his equation of 9/11 skepticism with mental illness and his characterization of the horrific event as a crime of Islam. By invoking the specter of disease to smear those seeking to break through the massive deceptions embedded in the 9/11 cover up, Kay conspicuously violates the rationalist principles of the Enlightenment tradition, a tradition he demeans even as he claims to defend it (p. 315).</p>
<p>Does Kevin Barrett Seek to ?Absolve Islam of a Terrible Crime??</p>
<p></p>
<p>Amidst his litany of condemnations, Jonathan Kay reserves some of his most vicious and vitriolic attacks for Kevin Barrett. For instance Kay harshly criticizes&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2013/11/05/chomsky-emails/" type="external">Dr. Barrett?s published E-Mail exchange</a>&amp;#160;in 2008 with Prof. Chomsky. In that exchange Barrett castigates Chomsky for not going to the roots of the event that ?doubled the military budget overnight, stripped Americans of their liberties and destroyed their Constitution.? The original misrepresentations of 9/11, argues Barrett, led to further ?false flag attacks to trigger wars, authoritarianism and genocide.?</p>
<p>In&amp;#160;Among The Truthers&amp;#160;Kay tries to defend Chomsky against Barrett?s alleged ?personal obsession? with ?vilifying? the MIT academic. Kay objects particularly to Barrett?s ?final salvo? in the published exchange where the Wisconsin public intellectual accuses Prof. Chomsky of having ?done more to keep the 9/11 blood libel alive, and cause the murder of more than a million Muslims than any other single person.? (p. 315)</p>
<p>Kevin Barrett:&amp;#160;Chomsky has done more to keep the 9/11 blood libel alive, and cause the murder of more than a million Muslims than any other single person.&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
<p>In a chapter subtitled&amp;#160;The New Face of Anti-Semitic Conspiracism, Kay refers to Barrett as&amp;#160;nebbish, as a ?say-anything bad boy.? (p. 287) In Kay?s opinion Barrett?s adherence to the Muslim religion has helped transform him into a ?militant, left-wing anti-Israeli obsessive? who has made ?common cause? with his fellow ?hatemongers in the Muslim Middle East.? (p. 292) As Kay sees it, Barrett?s record of research, publication and popular punditry directed at exposing the true nature of the 9/11 crimes is reprehensible because ?It absolves Islam of a terrible crime.? (p. 167)</p>
<p>Kay should be held to account for this stunning characterization of 9/11 as a crime committed not by specific human beings but rather by a religion. The clear implication of Kay?s profanity is that 2,000,000,000 Muslims are collectively responsible for the 9/11 debacle. Me thinks Kay doth protest too much.</p>
<p>Putting aside for a moment, the significance of this statement as a part of the 9/11 cover up, such generalizing rhetoric is emblematic of the hate speech used to inflame the violent assaults of race wars. Kay?s blood libel comment is representative of the kind of language used to drive on genocide in, for instance, the US Indian wars or the Maori wars in New Zealand. &amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
<p>The Pied Piper</p>
<p>In the You Tube entitled ?Noam Chomsky discusses 9/11 Conspiracy Theories,? the famous professor argues that all the effort that has gone into exposing the lies and crimes of 9/11 ?diverted a lot of energy from trying to stop the War on Iraq.? This single statement points to the irony of his tenure as the peace movement?s darling. Throughout the twenty-first century Chomsky retained his position at the center stage of the anti-war movement during a period of rampant and unbridled militarism.</p>
<p>&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Chomsky?s power-serving position on 9/11 discouraged progressive resistance to the ascendance of the neoconservative Right with all its covert operations, militaristic ambitions and neoliberal corporatist obsessions. During the period when he was treated like the Pope of the Left, Chomsky was instrumental in blocking the 9/11 Truth Movement from embracing its natural role near the animating heart of the anti-war movement.</p>
<p>Chomsky established the pattern adopted by many of his followers that the necessary critiques of war and repressions arising after 9/11 should not extend into any serious focus on the 9/11 event itself. This prohibition on drawing essential links between cause and effect has been instrumental in rendering the anti-war movement lame and bereft of significant political influence. There are obvious problems at the base of anti-war protests not rooted in sound analysis of the underlying dynamics of the conflicts at issue. Who did what to whom and why?</p>
<p>By keeping the window open to the possibility that the 9/11 debacle resulted from the independent actions of genuine Islamic jihadists acting alone, strategic high ground was sacrificed to the engineers of the most ambitious Black Op of all time. The harsh realities yet to be faced in our core institutions are that those who were supposed to protect us in fact facilitated many-faceted attacks against us that have dramatically undermined the quality of life for most human beings.</p>
<p>As long as officialdom can escape any reckoning with the pattern of violation that has rendered most of our core institutions of governance, communications, education and law enforcement as complicit partners in the 9/11 crimes, the same patterns of violation will continue. There is no decent future without assertive action by the citizenry, to hold accountable for their crimes the real culprits of 9/11 with all its related violations. This kind of understanding points to the aptness of the slogan that&amp;#160;9/11 Truth Ends 9/11 Wars.</p>
<p>Because of the aggressive interventions of Chomsky many peace activists were left ill-equipped, lacking the necessary orientation to counter effectively the neocons? expert incitement and exploitation of public fears of radical jihadists. In the light of this experience, how are we to view the Left?s # 1 public intellectual during a period of heightened warfare and unprecedented loss of ground for the rights of workers and average citizens, but especially Muslim workers and citizens?</p>
<p>Drawing the Obvious Conclusions</p>
<p>At the&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2016/05/20/leftforum-2/" type="external">Left Forum</a>&amp;#160;Kevin Barrett attempted to hold the Pope of the Left accountable for helping give cover to the perpetrators of the global coup d?etat that radically transformed geopolitics on September 11, 2001. As Barrett wrote on departing his family home in Lone Rock Wisconsin, ?To criticize Chomsky at the Left Forum in New York is sort of like going to the Vatican to criticize the Pope. But the doctrine of Papal Infallibility does not apply to Chomsky, despite what some of his admirers seem to think. So I do not expect to be met by the left-wing version of the Spanish Inquisition.?</p>
<p>There was a kind of sadness that swept over Kevin Barrett near the end of his commentary on ?Why Chomsky is Wrong on 9/11? at the left Forum in New York. Barrett has observed that so much of the dominant psychological operation since 9/11 has been engineered to influence people below the level of consciousness. This being the case, the impact of this contamination of the mental environment with the plague of Islamophobia cannot be addressed through rational argument alone.</p>
<p>Said Barrett, ?No amount of conscious deliberation and argumentation is ever going to change the overall body of consciousness of the people. There?s a kind of momentum that?s been built up by inculcating people with this official picture of 9/11. It is like a boulder rolling down the mountain that crushes rational arguments as it goes.? Barrett then backtracked to reconsider in a slightly more optimistic vein. He reflected, ?If the psychologically shocking truth of these events does emerge, that could actually change things?.. the whole country rising up, which is what we need. That?s precisely what would have happened if, instead of giving us this line of bullshit in November of 2001, Chomsky had pushed the whole Left towards just looking at Building 7 and drawing the obvious conclusions.? &amp;#160;</p>

<article id="0000255" published-at="2017-03-09" title="The White House is scrutinizing job candidates? old social media posts for criticism of Trump"><p>As President Trump continues to build out his administration, many of his officials are having trouble filling vacancies in their departments because of questions about the loyalty of the people they want to select ? questions that include scrutiny of old social media posts. Treasury Secretary <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-03-08/questions-about-loyalty-to-trump-stall-mnuchin-s-treasury-picks" type="external">Steve Mnuchin is sufficiently frustrated about the situation that ?people familiar with the matter?</a> leaked about his frustration to Bloomberg:</p>
<p>The White House?s reasons for the holdups vary, but questions about loyalty to Trump played a role in at least two cases, some of the people said.</p>
<p>Mnuchin?s pick for the Treasury?s top lawyer, Brent McIntosh, got an especially tough vetting by the White House personnel office after his Twitter feed was flagged as potentially critical of Trump.</p>
<p>I?ve been told by staff for independent regulators that candidates for jobs have been asked to hand over their Facebook passwords so that old posts can be scrutinized for criticism of Trump.</p>
<p>This sort of vetting has proved doubly frustrating to the people it?s hampering. The vast majority of Trump?s Cabinet appointees are outsiders to government services, and few of them believe they can run their agencies exclusively on the basis of outsiders. But there simply aren?t very many professional Republicans who?ve been consistent Trump supporters ? he had almost no endorsements from GOP elected officials during the primary, and ran his campaign as a frontal assault on the party establishment.</p>
<p>At the same time, the rules against disloyalty are not being enforced in any clear way. Energy Secretary Rick Perry called Trump a ?cancer.? Kellyanne Conway <a href="https://mediamatters.org/research/2016/08/19/here-s-how-trump-s-new-campaign-manager-attacked-him-cable-news-pundit/212524" type="external">used to work for a Ted Cruz Super PAC and was extremely critical of Trump</a>, talking about how he ?built a lot of his business on the backs of the little guy,? had screwed over ?victims of Trump University,? and engaged in ?unpresidential? rhetoric that was ?unfortunate for children.?</p>
<p>Then last night, the White House announced that it was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-08/trump-said-to-pick-former-un-spokesman-grenell-for-nato-post" type="external">appointing Richard Grenell as US ambassador to NATO</a>. Grenell is a well-qualified, experienced Republican who happens to have been viciously critical of Trump in the past. In other words, exactly the kind of guy whom many other administration principals are struggling to get past White House vetting.</p>
<p>. <a href="https://twitter.com/WordgirlSmith" type="external">@WordgirlSmith</a> yes. If you think Trump knows foreign policy issues then absolutely yes, you are stupid. A thousand times yes!</p>
<p>The bottom line is that everyone is confused. A rule disqualifying anyone who said mean things about Trump during the campaign bars far too many people from staffing the administration. At the same time, Trump remains concerned about leaks and loyalty and doesn?t seem to want to drop the idea entirely. Consequently, nobody is exactly sure who they are allowed to put forward for what position or why.</p></article>

<p></p>
<p>In our <a href="http://ericwalberg.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=618:trudeaumania-charms-washington&amp;amp;catid=39:europe-canada-and-us-&amp;amp;Itemid=92" type="external">last chapter on the reign of the Trudeau dynasty</a>, we saw Trudeau jr at what may prove to be his high point, a coveted state visit to Washington, feted by Americans besotted with royalty, a warmed over 1970s Trudeaumania. No substance, but lots of pretty selfies and photo ops of North America?s ?bromance?.</p>
<p>Syrian scam I</p>
<p>But already worrying signs are surfacing. Even as Obama addressed Canada?s parliament last month, another prominent America, ?gay international? activist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Long" type="external">Scott Long</a>, told Torontonians about his nightmare three years in Egypt, where dictator Sisi has launched a high profile campaign to arrest and torture gays. (The later Mubarak regime and the short-lived Muslim Brotherhood interlude did not persecute gays).</p>
<p>At the meeting, I met a Syrian fresh off the refugee ?boat?. He explained (in perfect English) that he had arrived from Egypt, where he and his other gay Syrian friends were given priority in processing their applications for Canadian immigration.</p>
<p>I expressed surprise, as the original refugee policy was <a href="http://ericwalberg.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=590:canadas-syrian-refugees-outing-our-immigrants&amp;amp;catid=39:europe-canada-and-us-&amp;amp;Itemid=92" type="external">not to give visas to any single men</a>, on the pretext that they might be terrorists. ?Yes, that was the first batch. I?m part of the second batch,? Raad glowed. ?My poor Egyptian friends were very jealous. It is impossible for them to get the precious Canadian visa, even though they are really being persecuted now. They live in terror.?</p>
<p>So while straight Syrian guys are spurned, their gay brothers are given the coveted top place on the lists of thousands of families, violating stated Canadian policy.</p>
<p>Syrian scam II</p>
<p>No need to bribe whomever to get to the top of the list, as rich Syrians have done. The going rate is $30,000 in Jordan, as one refugee sponsor in Toronto found out. Latif, himself an immigrant, patriotically jumped on Trudeau?s well-meant bandwagon and put up the $20,000 to sponsor a family. He rented a large home for them, and prepared a program to help them integrate.</p>
<p>Latif &amp;#160;was shocked when they refused to move into their new home, not wanting to abandon their clan at the homey hotel room provided by the Canadian government. They whined that they expected better, &amp;#160;that they were promised a swimming pool. Latif handed them back to the government, hurt by their ingratitude, suspecting they were bogus refugees, cutting his losses.</p>
<p>Assad - friend of gays</p>
<p>There is no question that gays nabbed by Daesh et al are bona fide claimants for refugee status. But the motley opposition in Syria &amp;#160;are our ?friends?, and the legitimate President Bashar Assad is our ?enemy?.</p>
<p>Don?t try to tell a Syrian gay that. Contrary to the western media image of a blood-thirsty dictatorship, ?the Syrian Arab Republic has never persecuted anyone for motives concerning their private life,? <a href="http://www.voltairenet.org/article192427.html" type="external">writes Thierry Meyssan.</a> The Lebanese daily L?Orient-Le Jour, financed by the European Union (i.e., anti-Assad), slammed the Lebanese government for persecuting gays, but admitted that ?under the r?gime of Bashar Assad, the gay community was enjoying a peaceful existence.?</p>
<p>L?Orient-Le Jour was told by a gay Syrian refugee that his period of military service was ?the most wonderful years of my life?, and that they had ?parties in reception halls rented by gay couples to celebrate their union?. It was only when Daesh arrived that he was obliged to ?hide his pink and yellow pants and practice walking in a more masculine way.?</p>
<p>There are 31,340 Syrians already approved. Harper was condemned for only promising 1,300 refugees, none gay. Maybe his niggardliness would have allowed more careful vetting of bogus claimants, and saved both us and Syrians from future (expensive) problems?</p>
<p>Maybe making peace with Assad, rather than trying to assassinate him, would allow Syrian gays to be protected by the legitimate Syrian government, &amp;#160;pick up where they left off in 2011, and these ?refugees? could stay at home, where they belong?</p>
<p>Let?s hope that these two troubling trends among the refugees are not indicative of a wider misuse of what was supposed to be an altruistic, if poorly thought-out, embrace of those suffering from the West?s obsession with destroying the only gay-tolerant Muslim regime.</p>
<p>Syria, coincidentally, is just about the last holdout against the West?s neoliberal nightmare systematically being inflicted on one and all, Muslim and non-Muslim. Along with Iran, Assad?s Syria iis the only country doing anything concrete to oppose Israel?s crimes. Is it perhaps for those reasons that the West had/has Assad in their target range?</p>
<p>Promises withering on the vine</p>
<p>But there are many other disturbing signs that <a href="http://ericwalberg.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=580:justin-trudeau-start-of-a-canadian-legend&amp;amp;catid=39:europe-canada-and-us-&amp;amp;Itemid=92" type="external">Justin?s beanstalk</a> is already suffering from rot. First to raise the alarm bells was the decision to go ahead with Harper?s swan song, the $15-billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia, selling weaponized armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia, despite <a href="http://ericwalberg.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=620:-canadas-saudi-arms-sales-dont-be-a-sucker-&amp;amp;catid=39:europe-canada-and-us-&amp;amp;Itemid=92" type="external">strong public opposition</a> and the obvious discomfort of &amp;#160;his ?messenger?, Foreign Minister Stephane Dion.</p>
<p>Dion was also forced to hold his nose on another indefensible, the Conservative motion targeting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign, &amp;#160;now in its eleventh year, and wildly popular among western students and people of all ages who have bothered to study the facts about Israel. Trudeau?s ?brave? move was actually <a href="http://ericwalberg.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=608:canadian-legend-chapter-v-caught-in-middle-east-quicksands&amp;amp;catid=39:europe-canada-and-us-&amp;amp;Itemid=92" type="external">denounced in parliament by Dion</a> (this time not the messenger).</p>
<p>The only real effect &amp;#160;was to lose Trudeau his many student supporters, including his fellow Quebeckers, who are the strongest supporters of the Palestinian struggle in Canada. Just try to tell an idealistic student ?No!? and see how far you get.</p>
<p>Then there?s the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Obama urged Trudeau to sign, even though <a href="http://rabble.ca/columnists/2016/07/trudeau-obama-and-neighbourly-love" type="external">75% of Canadians oppose it</a>.</p>
<p>Trudeau's surprises</p>
<p>It was a bit of a surprise that the Palestinians should be treated no better than under Harper. Poor Russia is also unpleasantly surprised to be getting the Harper treatment. <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/11/19/justin-trudeau-may-have-missed-the-memo-but-now-vladimir-putin-is-wests-best-friend-walkom.html" type="external">Justin loudly insulted Putin</a> during the election campaign and has not changed since, despite macho Putin graciously turning the other cheek. Canada will send hundreds of troops to ?protect? Latvia from the nasty Russians.</p>
<p>From the start, Trudeau has surprised, even shocked, many old-fashioned Canadians. He appointed four Sikhs and a Muslim Afghan woman to his Cabinet. ?I have more Sikhs in my Cabinet than [Indian PM] Modi,? he bragged. Not a very diplomatic comment, considering the delicacy of balancing an Indian Cabinet, where Sikhs conjure up the tragic assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.</p>
<p>Then there?s Trudeau?s brash promise in 2013 to a Kelowna BC crowd (?I?m actually not in favour of decriminalizing cannabis. I?m in favour of legalizing it.?). This shocked many, but made him an idol for youth, who made sure to come out to vote last October. A long overdue reform, one that dates from the 1972 Le Dain Report commissioned by Trudeau sr, buried in embarrassment.</p>
<p>But the Toronto police brought the policy crashing down, raiding half the 83 marijuana dispensaries in Toronto, confiscating legal supplies, declaring the hash brownies a ?health hazard? (which you can be sure they proceeded to consume with relish). Vancouver closed 30 without the police raid fanfare. Nary a peep from Parliament Hill. Hundreds of Trudeau?s most devoted followers lost their investments. Cowardly bungling big time.</p>
<p>Then there?s upcoming Bill C-16 that would ?ensure that Canadians will be free to identify themselves and to express their gender as they wish while being protected against discrimination and hate," according to Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould in May. Such a radical change to Canadian laws was not part of the Liberal election package, and was not debated. It ventures into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7B8Q6D4a6TM" type="external">controversial territory which is still not understood</a>.</p>
<p>Storm clouds</p>
<p>Muslim Canadians are concerned about the potential of the Syrian refugee project turning sour. Says legitimate Muslim immigrant Munib, ?I came here 30 years ago with $100, and worked hard. I made a life and didn?t ask for any special treatment. There was none anyway.</p>
<p>?I worry that many of these Syrians have come on false pretenses and will create ill-will towards millions of honest, hard working immigrants, who are the backbone of Canada. They will be fuel for those who are against Muslims. Look at Trump and how he manipulates the immigrant issue.?</p>
<p>Is Justin?s beanstalk a mirage? Will Canadians soon be nostalgic for penny-pinching, honestly bigoted Harper? At least we knew what to expect. Hey, is Trudeau just Harper lite? There are too many lurches and gaffes so far for Canadians to ?feel free?, as Wilson-Raybould opines. Still on his agenda are electoral reform and the tar sands. Let?s hope for some backbone.</p>

<article id="0000267" published-at="2005-06-13" title="Cities vs. those suburbs"><p>Last week certainly was a ? <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/11/opinion/11tierney.html?ex=1276142400&amp;amp;en=48545fed1daabb16&amp;amp;ei=5090&amp;amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;amp;emc=rss" type="external">week to rejoice</a>? if you love cities, although I think John Tierny missed the boat on exactly why. With the Accords <a href="http://www.wed2005.org/3.1.php" type="external">signed</a>, the sustainable (and not so sustainable) <a href="http://www.sustainlane.com/cityindex/citypage.php?name=ranking" type="external">ranked</a>, and the cul-de-sac <a href="/article/grid-schlock" type="external">revived and debunked</a>, it was enough to give any aspiring urban planner a headache.</p>
<p>The statistics getting tossed around are staggering too. Just the first clause of the Urban Environmental Accords contains two rather impressive facts:</p>
<p>And that got me thinkin?: Whaddaya mean, ?city??</p>
<p>In search of the answer to this eloquent question, I headed to the webpages of the UN, since it is their Environment Program after all. <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sconcerns/densurb/densurbmethods.htm" type="external">Turns out</a> that:</p>
<p>Because of national differences in the characteristics that distinguish urban from rural areas, the distinction between the urban and the rural population is not yet amenable to a single definition that would be applicable to all countries or, for the most part, even to the countries within a region.</p>
<p>Don?t worry, our hero will not give up that easily; more below the fold.I decided to, for now, say that a city is anything with over 1,000,000 people in it. Fine. Where does that leave us? From <a href="http://www.citypopulation.de/World.html" type="external">Thomas Brinkoff?s handy site</a>, there are 428 ?principal agglomerations? in the world with more than a million people in them. Summing their populations with a spreadsheet gives about 1.5 billion people. That?s more like a quarter of the world population, not half.</p>
<p>To me, the statistic proclaiming that a majority of the world?s population lives in cities is slightly misleading. While it may be technically true, when I think city, I think mega-city. I think New York City, or Tokyo, or Beijing. Especially when I think ?green city,? I think of towering structures that ? <a href="http://cascadiascorecard.typepad.com/blog/2005/06/grow_up_not_out.html" type="external">grow up, not out</a>,? of public transportation that can whisk you from one side of town to the other quickly and cheaply, of integrated zoning that makes walking everywhere a possibility.</p>
<p>In order to say that half the world?s people live in cities, my guess is that we are going to have to include some of those <a href="/article/suburbia-oil-and-preferences" type="external">dreaded suburbs</a> as ?cities.? So the challenge I set forth (besides making it through this post) is this:</p>
<p>How do you define ?city??</p></article>
<article id="0000281" title="How Is Bradley Manning Really Being Treated?"><p>15 January, 2011 <a href="http://warisacrime.org/node/56250" type="external">Warisacrime.org</a></p>
<p>There are conflicting accounts of exactly how Bradley Manning, the alleged whistleblower on countless U.S. government crimes, has been illegally punished for 8 months so far, pre-trial. There's no denying that this young man who allegedly sought to make his government's actions known for the public good and did not seek to profit thereby has been denied a speedy trial. The question is to what extent he has already been punished, and even cruelly and unusually punished, without having been convicted of any crime. But the accounts differ less than it at first appears. And there is one sure way to find out the facts.</p>
<p>Let's look first at what Glenn Greenwald <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/12/14/manning" type="external">reported</a> on December 15th. Greenwald wrote that he had interviewed "several people directly familiar with the conditions of Manning's detention, ultimately including a Quantico brig official (Lt. Brian Villiard) who confirmed much of what they conveyed." In Greenwald's account, Manning had been a model detainee and had never been on suicide watch, but had been declared from the start a "Maximum Custody Detainee," and had been held from the start in "intensive solitary confinement . . . for 23 out of 24 hours every day . . . he sits completely alone in his cell."</p>
<p>In Greenwald's account, Manning is forbidden from exercising in his cell and is under "constant surveillance." He has, or at least had at this time, no pillow or sheets. And during his one hour out of his cell he is barred from accessing any news (apparently meaning on television or radio) according to some of Greenwald's sources, presumably including David House, a friend of Manning's whom Greenwald cites, but not according to Lt. Villiard. According to Greenwald, "Lt. Villiard protested that the conditions are not 'like jail movies where someone gets thrown into the hole,' but confirmed that he is in solitary confinement, entirely alone in his cell except for the one hour per day he is taken out." Greenwald did not say whether Manning's cell was silent or whether he could hear the voices of other prisoners or guards. He did not say whether the cell had a window or access to daylight. He did say that Manning was being administered regular doses of anti-depressants. I am assuming no one outside the military is able to confirm what drugs Manning has actually been administered or whether they have all been antidepressants, and that Manning himself cannot confirm this. But there is one way to find out.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On December 18th, Manning's lawyer David Coombs <a href="http://www.armycourtmartialdefense.info/2010/12/typical-day-for-pfc-bradley-manning.html" type="external">wrote</a> about Manning's treatment on his website. Coombs used two terms to describe Manning's detention: "maximum custody" and "Prevention of Injury (POI) watch." Coombs continued:</p>
<p>"His cell is approximately six feet wide and twelve feet in length. The cell has a bed, a drinking fountain, and a toilet. . . . [H]e is not allowed to sleep at anytime between 5:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. If he attempts to sleep during those hours, he will be made to sit up or stand by the guards. He is allowed to watch television [apparently in his cell] during the day. The television stations are limited to the basic local stations. His access to the television ranges from 1 to 3 hours on weekdays to 3 to 6 hours on weekends."</p>
<p>Coombs continued, describing the cell: "He cannot see other inmates from his cell. He can occasionally hear other inmates talk. Due to being a pretrial confinement facility, inmates rarely stay at the facility for any length of time. Currently, there are no other inmates near his cell.</p>
<p>"From 7:00 p.m. to 9:20 p.m., he is given correspondence time. He is given access to a pen and paper. He is allowed to write letters to family, friends, and his attorneys. Each night, during his correspondence time, he is allowed to take a 15 to 20 minute shower. On weekends and holidays, he is allowed to have approved visitors see him from 12:00 to 3:00 p.m. He is allowed to receive letters from those on his approved list and from his legal counsel. If he receives a letter from someone not on his approved list, he must sign a rejection form. The letter is then either returned to the sender or destroyed.</p>
<p>"He is allowed to have any combination of up to 15 books or magazines. He must request the book or magazine by name. Once the book or magazine has been reviewed by the literary board at the confinement facility, and approved, he is allowed to have someone on his approved list send it to him. The person sending the book or magazine to him must do so through a publisher or an approved distributor such as Amazon. They are not allowed to mail the book or magazine directly to PFC Manning.</p>
<p>"Due to being held on Prevention of Injury (POI) watch: PFC Manning is held in his cell for approximately 23 hours a day. The guards are required to check on PFC Manning every five minutes by asking him if he is okay. PFC Manning is required to respond in some affirmative manner. At night, if the guards cannot see PFC Manning clearly, because he has a blanket over his head or is curled up towards the wall, they will wake him in order to ensure he is okay. . . . He is not allowed to have a pillow or sheets. However, he is given access to two blankets and has recently been given a new mattress that has a built-in pillow.</p>
<p>"He is not allowed to have any personal items in his cell. He is only allowed to have one book or one magazine at any given time to read in his cell. The book or magazine is taken away from him at the end of the day before he goes to sleep. He is prevented from exercising in his cell. If he attempts to do push-ups, sit-ups, or any other form of exercise he will be forced to stop. He does receive one hour of 'exercise' outside of his cell daily. He is taken to an empty room and only allowed to walk. PFC Manning normally just walks figure eights in the room for the entire hour. If he indicates that he no long feels like walking, he is immediately returned to his cell. When PFC Manning goes to sleep, he is required to strip down to his boxer shorts and surrender his clothing to the guards. His clothing is returned to him the next morning."</p>
<p>*** On December 23rd, David House <a href="http://my.firedoglake.com/blog/2010/12/23/bradley-manning-speaks-about-his-conditions" type="external">posted</a> his own report on Manning's condition:</p>
<p>"In his five months of detention [not counting two previous months in Kuwait], it has become obvious to me that Manning's physical and mental well-being are deteriorating. What Manning needs, and what his attorney has already urged, is to have the unnecessary 'Prevention of Injury' order lifted that severely restricts his ability to exercise, communicate, and sleep."</p>
<p>"Manning has been living under the solitary restrictions of POI for five months despite being cleared by a military psychologist earlier this year, and despite repeated calls from his attorney David Coombs to lift the severely restrictive and isolating order. POI orders are short-term restrictions that are typically implemented when a detainee changes confinement facilities and these orders are lifted after the detainee passes psychological evaluation."</p>
<p>House quotes from a Daily Beast report of an interview with Coombs stating that Manning was initially -- and the article implies, baselessly -- placed on suicide watch: "When he was first arrested, Manning was put on suicide watch, but his status was quickly changed to 'Prevention of Injury' watch (POI), and under this lesser pretense he has been forced into his life of mind-numbing tedium. . . . Both Coombs and Manning's psychologist, Coombs says, are sure Manning is mentally healthy, that there is no evidence he's a threat to himself, and shouldn't be held in such severe conditions under the artifice of his own protection."</p>
<p>House quoted statements the Pentagon released in response to Greenwald's report: "A maximum custody detainee is able to receive the same privileges that a detainee classified as general population may receive. . . . A maximum custody detainee also receives daily television, hygiene call, reading and outside physical activity without restraint. . . . Pfc. Manning, as well as every other maximum custody detainee, is allotted approximately one hour of television per day. He may view any of the available channels. . . . Pfc. Manning is allotted one hour of recreation time per day, as is every other maximum custody detainee. Depending on the weather, his recreation time may be spend indoors or outdoors. Activities may include calisthenics, running, basketball, etc. . . . Pfc. Manning, as well as all other detainees, is issued adequate bedding."</p>
<p>House wrote that Manning had denied to him, during recent visits, some of the military's assertions:</p>
<p>"Manning related to me on December 18 2010 that he is not allowed to view international news during his television period. He mentioned that he might theoretically be able to view local news, but his television period is typically from 7pm ? 8pm such that no local news is playing in the Quantico, VA area. Manning told me explicitly on December 18 2010 that he is not, nor has he ever been, allowed newspapers while in confinement. When I said 'The Pentagon has stated that you are allowed newspapers', his immediate reaction was surprised laughter.</p>
<p>". . . Manning stated to me on December 18 2010 that he has not been outside or into the brig yard for either recreation nor exercise in four full weeks. He related that visits to the outdoors have been infrequent and sporadic for the past several months."</p>
<p>". . . Manning related to me on December 18 2010 that he does not receive any substantive exercise and cannot perform even basic exercises in his cell. When told of the Pentagon's statement that he did indeed receive exercise, Manning's reply was that he is able to exercise insofar as walking in chains is a form of exercise."</p>
<p>". . . Manning related to me on December 19 2010 that his blankets are similar in weight and heft to lead aprons used in X-ray laboratories, and similar in texture to coarse and stiff carpet. He . . . expressed concern that he had to lie very still at night to avoid receiving carpet burns. The problem of carpet burns was exacerbated, he related, by the stipulation that he must sleep only in his boxer shorts as part of the longstanding POI order. Manning also stated on December 19 2010 that hallway-mounted lights shine through his window at night. This constant illumination is consistent with reports from attorney David Coombs' blog that marines must visually inspect Manning as he sleeps."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On January 14th, Scott Shane of the New York Times published the military's claims:</p>
<p>"The military rejects accusations that Private Manning has been mistreated. 'Poppycock,' said Col. T. V. Johnson, a Quantico spokesman. He insisted that the conditions of confinement were dictated by brig rules for a pretrial detainee like Private Manning. The soldier has been designated for 'maximum custody' ? applied because his escape would pose a national security risk ? and placed on 'prevention-of-injury watch,' restrictions imposed so that he does not injure himself. That status is based on the judgment of military medical experts and the observations of brig guards, Colonel Johnson said. Guards check Private Manning every five minutes but allow him to sleep without interruption from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., when only dim night lights are on, unless they need to wake him to be certain he is breathing. Colonel Johnson denied that Private Manning was in solitary confinement, as has been widely claimed, saying that he could talk with guards and with prisoners in nearby cells, though he could not see them. He leaves his 6-by-12-foot cell for a daily hour of exercise, and for showers, phone calls, meetings with his lawyer and weekend visits by friends and relatives, the colonel said. The prisoner can read and watch television and correspond with people on an approved list. He is not permitted to speak to the media. 'Pfc. Manning is being treated just like every other detainee in the brig,' said an internal military review concluded on Dec. 27 and read to a reporter by Colonel Johnson."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>What qualifies lights as dim is open to debate. Making certain someone is breathing has the same effect as maliciously interrupting their sleep for no good reason. The guards do not converse with Manning, according to his lawyer. And being permitted to talk to other prisoners by shouting to other cells is all very good, unless those cells are empty. His exercise is not described here. He may be being treated like every other prisoner would be if they were put permanently on POI status, but are they? I understand from someone who has spoken with Villiard that he admits the duration of Manning's POI status is unusual. And I understand from the Eighth Amendment that cruel and unusual punishment is illegal, as is any punishment prior to a trial, and as is denial of a speedy trial (see the Sixth Amendment).</p>
<p>Manning's lawyer has asked repeatedly to have the POI status lifted and received no response. He is now asking that Manning be freed until trial:</p>
<p>"Due to the lack of response from the confinement facility, the defense, pursuant to the provisions of Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 305(g), filed a request earlier today with the Garrison Commander to direct the release of PFC Bradley Manning from pretrial confinement. This request is based upon the fact that the confinement conditions currently being endured by PFC Manning are more rigorous than necessary to guarantee his presence at trial, and that the concerns raised by the government at the time of pretrial confinement are no longer applicable."</p>
<p>This is the one way to learn the truth of the matter: Free Bradley Manning.</p>
<p>There is also a way to hide even more: keep Manning in a condition that is almost guaranteed to damage his mind, and then conduct a secret trial.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that the materials Manning is alleged to have made public were available to some 3 million people while "secret." That's more people than some governments employ. Manning apparently believed the rest of us had a right to know what was being done with our money and in our names. On Christmas Eve, Manning released this statement through his lawyer:</p>
<p>"I greatly appreciate everyone's support and well wishes during this time. I am also thankful for everything that has been done to aid in my defense. I ask that everyone takes the time to remember those who are separated from their loved ones at this time due to deployment and important missions. Specifically, I am thinking of those that I deployed with and have not seen for the last seven months, and of the staff here at the Quantico Confinement Facility who will be spending their Christmas without their family."</p>
<p>If you are as concerned about Bradley Manning's condition as he is about his jailers', you can join in a demonstration outside the brig where he is held on Monday, Martin Luther King Day, January 17th in Quantico, Va. Our demand will be a simple one: <a href="http://www.defendingdissent.org/action/Events.htm" type="external">Free Bradley Manning!</a></p>

<article id="0000282" published-at="2014-06-12" title="Iraq Asked US for Airstrikes on Surging Al-Qaeda Groups ? Obama Turned Them Down"><p>The Iraqi government asked the United States for airstrikes in western Iraq on surging Al-Qaeda groups.But, Barack Obama has turned them down. <a href="" type="internal"></a> Al-Qaeda members hold a celebratory parade.</p>
<p>Iraqis <a href="" type="internal">swam the Tigris River</a> this week in Mosul in order to escape advancing Al-Qaeda fighters.</p>
<p>Al-Qaeda is now 100 miles outside of Baghdad. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/12/world/middleeast/iraq-asked-us-for-airstrikes-on-militants-officials-say.html?_r=1" type="external">The New York Times</a> reported:</p>
<p>As the threat from Sunni militants in western Iraq escalated last month, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki secretly asked the Obama administration to consider carrying out airstrikes against extremist staging areas, according to Iraqi and American officials.</p>
<p>But Iraq?s appeals for a military response have so far been rebuffed by the White House, which has been reluctant to open a new chapter in a conflict that President Obama has insisted was over when the United States withdrew the last of its forces from Iraq in 2011.</p>
<p>The swift capture of Mosul by militants aligned with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria has underscored how the conflicts in Syria and Iraq have converged into one widening regional insurgency with fighters coursing back and forth through the porous border between the two countries. But it has also called attention to the limits the White House has imposed on the use of American power in an increasingly violent and volatile region.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the National Security Council, Bernadette Meehan, declined to comment on Mr. Maliki?s requests. ?We are not going to get into details of our diplomatic discussions,? she said in a statement. ?The current focus of our discussions with the government of Iraq and our policy considerations is to build the capacity of the Iraqis to successfully confront? the Islamic extremists.</p>

<article id="0000301" published-at="2017-04-19" title="Trump's H-1B visa executive order: read the full text"><p>On Tuesday, President Donald Trump <a href="" type="internal">signed an executive order</a> directing federal agencies to review their policies with respect to hiring foreign workers, and to examine the controversial H-1B visa program for skilled foreign workers, popular with many tech companies.</p>
<p>The order also directed agencies to minimize the number of waivers the government issues that allow exceptions to ?Buy American Laws.?</p>
<p>Trump signed the order while on a visit to the headquarters of Snap-On, a tool manufacturer in Kenosha, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Though the order is intended as demonstration of Trump?s commitment to his ?America First? campaign promise, the direct impact of the order remains unclear. In January, when Trump <a href="" type="internal">signed an executive action</a> restarting construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, he touted a new requirement that the pipeline be made with American steel. In early March, however, his administration revealed that the Keystone pipeline would be <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-trump-won-t-require-keystone-pipeline-1488585551-htmlstory.html" type="external">exempt</a> from the ?buy American? requirement.</p>
<p>Trump?s latest order makes it clear that all components of steel production must occur in the US to qualify as American.</p>
<p>The full text of the order is available below:</p>
<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to ensure the faithful execution of the laws, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>

<p>(b) "Produced in the United States" means, for iron and steel products, that all manufacturing processes, from the initial melting stage through the application of coatings, occurred in the United States.</p>
<p>(c) "Petition beneficiaries" means aliens petitioned for by employers to become nonimmigrant visa holders with temporary work authorization under the H-1B visa program.</p>
<p>(d) "Waivers" means exemptions from or waivers of Buy American Laws, or the procedures and conditions used by an executive department or agency (agency) in granting exemptions from or waivers of Buy American Laws.</p>
<p>(e) "Workers in the United States" and "United States workers" shall both be defined as provided at section 212(n)(4)(E) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(4)(E)).</p>

<p>(c) To the extent permitted by law, before granting a public interest waiver, the relevant agency shall take appropriate account of whether a significant portion of the cost advantage of a foreign-sourced product is the result of the use of dumped steel, iron, or manufactured goods or the use of injuriously subsidized steel, iron, or manufactured goods, and it shall integrate any findings into its waiver determination as appropriate.</p>
<p>Sec. 5. Ensuring the Integrity of the Immigration System in Order to "Hire American."

<article id="0000307" published-at="2017-03-16" title="Radio Host Michael Savage Reports He Was Attacked While Dining"><p>Controversial radio show host Michael Savage <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4317798/Pro-Trump-radio-host-Michael-Savage-claims-attacked.html" type="external">says he was attacked</a> while eating dinner at a California restaurant.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Michael Savage, the 74-year-old host of the nationally syndicated talk radio show Savage Nation, was dining solo at Servino Ristorante in Tiburon, with his toy poodle, Teddy, keeping him company, when another patron allegedly began taunting him by saying, 'weener, weener.'</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The heckler was apparently referring to Savage's legal name, Michael Alan Weiner.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As Savage was heading out the door, the verbal abuse allegedly turned physical when the jeerer knocked the septuagenarian to the ground, according to the talk show host's attorney, Daniel Horowitz.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When another diner tried to step in between the brawlers, he was punched in the face, Horowitz told the <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/03/15/pro-trump-radio-host-michael-savage-claims-he-was-assaulted-outside-marin-county-restaurant/" type="external">Mercury News.</a></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Savage said "this guy can't get away with that," lawyer Horowitz told the paper.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Tiburon Police Department confirms the incident took place. When they arrived on the scene, police found both people had placed each other under a citizen's arrest. Law enforcement let both men go.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The district attorney's office will determine whether or not to file charges.</p>

<article id="0000308" title="In N.Y., Kasich Stresses Contrasts With Rivals"><p>NEW YORK?John Kasich went to Donald Trump?s Manhattan on Tuesday to urge New Yorkers, and the GOP at large, against choosing a candidate whose ideas and rhetoric ?could drive American down into a ditch.?</p>
<p>The Ohio governor didn?t mention Trump, or his other rival, Ted Cruz, by name, but challenged their campaign themes and policy proposals in an attempt to establish himself as the viable alternative at a contested convention in his home state this summer.</p>
<p>?Some who feed off of the fears and anger that is felt by some of us and&amp;#160;exploit it, feed their own insatiable desire for fame or attention,? Kasich said. ?That could drive America down into a ditch, not make us great again.?</p>
<p>Kasich also railed, in his subdued way, against proposals from his rivals to create a religious test for refugees, monitor Muslim neighborhoods, and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants. He identified other ideas articulated by Trump, such as withdrawing from NATO, imposing tariffs on imports, and allowing more nations to have nuclear weapons.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>?I have stood on a stage and watched with amazement as candidates wallowed in the mud, viciously attacked one another, called each other liars and disparaged each other?s character,? Kasich said. ?Those who continuously push that type of behavior are not worthy of the office they are seeking.?</p>
<p>This ?Two Paths? speech comes as Kasich faces <a href="" type="internal">mounting pressure</a> to quit the Republican presidential race, given that he has won only one state and lags far behind in the delegate count. Kasich?s proffered vision also comes one week before the New York primary, the results of which could again reset the race in favor of Trump.</p>
<p>The real estate mogul is leading in his home state by 32 percentage points, according to the RealClearPolitics polling <a href="" type="internal">average</a>. Kasich and Cruz aren?t aiming to win the state outright, but since New York awards most of its 95 delegates by congressional district?whoever wins over 50 percent in a district wins its three delegates?Trump?s rivals are targeting certain areas in an attempt to thwart his chance of securing the 1,237 delegates need to sew up the nomination before the convention.</p>
<p>Both candidates have campaigned in Democratic strongholds in the Bronx, for example, where just a few hundred Republican votes <a href="" type="internal">could help them win delegates</a>. Later on Tuesday, Kasich planned to visit a matzo bakery in Brooklyn, where Cruz stopped last week in an attempt to win over conservative Jewish voters, as well as a school for autistic students.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Kasich has campaigned this cycle as the happy camper with a hopeful vision. He hasn?t engaged with his rivals much, nor have they engaged with him?mostly because he hasn?t been perceived as a threat. But in recent weeks, as he tries to prove himself a viable contender, he has pointed out sharp contrasts between himself and the others, even criticizing the Texas senator for lacking legislative accomplishments.</p>
<p>Kasich maintains that while Cruz has been successful in picking up delegates, he isn?t electable nationwide in November. The governor believes both Cruz and Trump would not only lose the White House, but cost Republicans contests down the ballot.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>"What, are we going to pick someone who can't win? I mean, that would be nuts," Kasich told CBS?s ?Face the Nation? on Sunday.</p>
<p>The governor believes that while he trails in the delegate count now, he will surpass Marco Rubio?s total by the time the primaries are over. He is looking to make up ground in New York next week, as well as in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and other contests later this month. Kasich insists that once Republicans get past the first ballot at the convention, he and his positive general election message will emerge as a consensus choice. Critics argue, though, that the governor is largely undefined, and that his poll numbers vs. the Democratic nominee wouldn?t necessarily hold in a general election.</p>
<p>Still, he is pressing on. And his style is unique. At times during his speech Tuesday, it wasn?t entirely apparent he was even running in this Republican primary.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>?America is still great,? he said, pointing to advances in technology, transportation, and life expectancy. ?America?s economy is still the largest and most productive in the world.?</p>
<p>He also warned against the doom and gloom rhetoric often pushed by his rivals: ?America is still great.?</p>

<article id="0000309" published-at="2016-12-07" title="Ohio Seeks To ?Trump? The Constitution With Heartbeat Abortion Law"><p>Now that Donald Trump has been elected, anti-choice advocates have tacked a heartless <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/07/politics/ohio-abortion-bill/" type="external">?heartbeat? bill</a> onto a child abuse prevention bill and subsequently passed it.</p>
<p>In Ohio, anti-women advocates pushed for a law that would outlaw abortion after the heartbeat of a fetus is detectable (around 6 weeks). They knew it wouldn?t stand up to constitutional scrutiny. In fact, similar bills in two states have been found unconstitutional. This bill has no exceptions for the health of the mother, incest, or rape.</p>
<p>Ohio Democratic Women?s Caucus <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/12/06/ohio-senate-passes-heartbeat-bill.html" type="external">Chair Kathy DiCristofaro</a> said:</p>
<p>?this bill ? which was tacked on as a last-minute amendment to a child abuse prevention bill ? makes no exceptions for rape or incest victims. It is cruel and plainly unconstitutional ? but it seems like Ohio Republicans don?t care about the Constitution. Trump?s vision for America is already alive and well in the Buckeye State.?</p>
<p>Did you think they would wait for his nomination to start attacking women?s rights? Why should they?</p>
<p>Officials of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio issued <a href="http://www.prochoiceohio.org/media/press/20161206.shtml" type="external">a statement</a> saying:</p>
<p>?The unconstitutional six-week abortion ban, known as the ?Heartbeat Bill,? would block access to safe and legal abortion before most women even know they?re pregnant. The amendment has no exceptions in the bill for rape, incest, or to protect the health of the woman and would criminalize doctors who perform abortion procedures, regardless of the reason.?</p>
<p>The bill makes it a 5th-degree felony to perform an abortion without checking for or after detecting a fetal heartbeat.</p>
<p>Senate President <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/12/06/ohio-senate-passes-heartbeat-bill.html" type="external">Keith Faber (R)</a>, when asked why they suddenly decided to push the bill said: ?A new president, new Supreme Court appointees change the dynamic, and there was consensus in our caucus to move forward.? Faber is one of the anti-science, anti-women people who believe that life begins at conception, and all women should be forced to carry all fertilized eggs regardless of circumstance.</p>
<p>If you don?t think a Trump court will overturn Roe v. Wade, he <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/14/politics/trump-gay-marriage-abortion-supreme-court/" type="external">&amp;#160;was very clear</a>that he was committed to appointing justices to the SCOTUS who want to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling affirming abortion rights. Republicans in Ohio actually have another 20-week abortion <a href="http://www.muskogeephoenix.com/region/ohio-gop-wants-to-add--week-abortion-ban-to/article_f7d414be-41e8-50e4-a340-9aa1348e7e18.html" type="external">ban in the wings</a>, one that is more likely to survive a SCOTUS challenge in the Trump era.</p>
<p>For 42 years, women had the right to end unwanted pregnancies safely. This election will be the end of that. Overturning Roe v. Wade is the clear goal of anti-choice groups. Ohio Right to Life President Michael Gonidakis said his group been pushing for separate legislation to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, which was added last-minute to a House committee Tuesday could get a vote this week. They are neutral on the 6 week ban because they know that it has failed legal <a href="http://www.timesreporter.com/news/20161207/ohio-politics-now-will-john-kasich-sign-heartbeat-bill" type="external">challenges before</a>:</p>
<p>?Our ultimate goal is to overturn Roe v. Wade and we feel the 20-week ban is the best (legal) strategy. There is a reason no other state has a Heartbeat Bill.?</p>
<p>Republicans in Ohio have now fired the first shots at the Constitution. They won?t stop attacking women?s rights, (including&amp;#160;the right to vote, for some Trumpers who cried to ?repeal the 19th?). In fact, they are hip deep in propaganda calling a less than 2-inch long, unviable fetus that is the size of a shrimp ?babies with beating hearts.? <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/janet-porters-heartbeat-bill-passes-ohio-state-house/" type="external">Janet Porter</a>, president of Faith2Action who has pushed for passage of the bill for years, sometimes with unrelenting tactics including protests at members? homes said:</p>
<p>?It?s a brand-new day with a Trump-appointed Supreme Court and we are very hopeful ? we will see babies with beating hearts protected again.?</p>

<article id="0000311" title="The Democrats? Soviet Insane Asylum for Trump"><p>The former Soviet Union possessed many imaginative mechanisms to deal with the problem of enemies of the people who obstructed the path to socialist utopia -- now known as ?social justice.? One of those mechanisms was the practice of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/14/us/psychiatric-abuse-in-soviet-assailed.html" type="external">confining individuals</a> who were thinking the wrong thoughts to insane asylums. Indeed, if you caused any trouble for the commissars, a good <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/14/us/psychiatric-abuse-in-soviet-assailed.html" type="external">inoculation of neuroleptics</a> (powerful drugs used to ?quiet? the symptoms of schizophrenia), forcibly administered through a tube in the nose, could do wonders in bringing your politically incorrect behavior to a halt.</p>
<p>Dissidents such as Natalya Gorbanevskaya, Pyotr Grigorenko, Vladimir Bukovsky, Alexander Esenin-Volpin and Joseph Brodsky were all among the brave freedom-fighters who bore the brunt of the Soviet practice of institutionalizing dissidents in mental hospitals and force-feeding them mind-shattering drugs. Gorbanevskaya was committed to a psychiatric hospital for attending the 1968 Red Square demonstration against the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. Grigorenko suffered the same fate for criticizing the Khrushchev regime. Bukovsky was confined to a psychiatric hospital for ?anti-Soviet agitation.? Brodksy was sent to mental hospitals for not writing the right kind of poetry; his treatments involved "tranquilizing" injections, sleep deprivation and forced freezing baths. Esenin-Volpin was institutionalized in the Leningrad Special Psychiatric Hospital for his anti-Soviet thoughts. Today?s progressive Democrats are also faithfully journeying on an uplifting odyssey. Horrified by Trump?s opposition to Obama?s ?fundamental transformations,? they have found their own neuroleptics in the form of the 25th Amendment and a bill seeking to impeach the president for being mentally unsound. Indeed, Trump has to be mentally deranged and unfit for office, because what other reason could possibly explain his frightening disagreement with <a href="" type="internal">the Left?s un-American creed of identity politics</a> -- race and gender uber alles? What other factor could possibly be at play in his embrace of individual freedom and responsibility -- and in his rejection of group privileges and racial/gender hierarchies that, as <a href="" type="internal">David Horowitz has noted</a>, can only be manifested after America?s Constitution is null and void? Confronted by Trump?s shocking blasphemy against their anointed plan, several Democrats, led by Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), have now signed onto <a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/07/01/donald-trump-removed-office-25th-amendment-democrats-jamie-raskin-jackson-lee" type="external">a bill</a> that seeks to remove Trump by invoking 25th Amendment powers. The bill cites <a href="https://www.axios.com/house-democrats-bill-to-remove-trump-2451395423.html" type="external">section 4 of the amendment</a>, created in 1967 after JFK's assassination, that allows for an independent body to remove the president based on the determination that he has been mentally or physically incapacitated to carry out his duties. Raskin's initiative would activate a probe into whether Trump has been too far "incapacitated" to continue as president.</p>
<p>This effort is, actually, even sicker than the Soviet practice, since the amendment does not refer to psychiatric problems, but to actual incapacitation through assassination or stroke.</p>
<p>Raskin <a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/07/01/donald-trump-removed-office-25th-amendment-democrats-jamie-raskin-jackson-lee" type="external">claims</a> he is concerned that "something is seriously wrong" with Trump, citing a "sustained pattern of behavior" and several "errant and seemingly deranged tweets," which he believes are damaging to U.S. interests. But to anyone who hasn?t drunk the progressive Kool-Aid, it is obvious that Trump?s sustained pattern of behavior is not damaging U.S. interests. Instead, it is unhinging his political enemies and damaging the progressive assault on America?s social contract. Trump?s tweets do not warn, for example, that the future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAwMpL7POyo" type="external">an Obama meme</a>) or that you can keep your doctor if you like him. They are singing the praises of America and calling out a corrupt media for its brazen lies and political partisanship.</p>
<p>The only <a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/07/01/donald-trump-removed-office-25th-amendment-democrats-jamie-raskin-jackson-lee" type="external">reasonable observation</a> in Raskin?s statements is that (to people like him): "it certainly doesn't feel like the ship is on an even course right now."</p>
<p>Consequently, the Democrats are now trying to steer the ship back into progressive waters. They are doing so by applying the lessons of the Soviet secret police -- in quashing those who disagree with them like Andrei Sakharov. Sakharov refused to toe the Soviet party line and be politically correct; therefore, like Trump, he was also obviously mentally ill. That?s why the Soviet authorities had to confine him in a closed ward of the Semashko Hospital in Gorky, where he was force-fed and given drugs to alter and enlighten his state of mind.</p>
<p>And now enter the new self-appointed social redeemers of our time: the progressive Democrats who are consumed with ferocious rage as they watch the horror show of an American president strengthening America and abandoning the enlightened course on which Obama?s ship sailed. There is no secret about what the true yearnings of the Raskin Gang are, but absent a totalitarian state to back them up, they are bound to fail.</p></article>
<article id="0000315" title=""><p><a href="" type="internal"></a>Leave it to the tea party to turn the original intent of Woodstock, peace, love, and music into an excuse to beat down dissent. According to MSNBC?s Contessa Brewer the tea partiers in Mesa, NV got rough with hecklers, as one heckler was drug out by the arm, and another by the hair, because nothing says freedom like beating down dissent.</p>

<p>MSNBC?s Contessa Brewer has posted to her <a href="http://www.facebook.com/contessamsnbc/posts/103294779710314#!/contessamsnbc?ref=nf" type="external">Facebook page these updates</a>, ?Mesa crowd getting rough with hecklers: one guy grabbed the heckler by the hair.? Brewer also posted, Sarah Palin to heckler: Young man, stick around. Maybe you?ll learn something. Then other citizens dragged him out by his arms.? Nothing says real America to the tea party like physically beating down any voices of dissent in the room.</p>
<p>The radical right is now displaying its full colors. They aren?t protesting taxes, the size of government or health care. What we have here is a small group of angry conspiracy theorists, homophobes, and racists, who can?t accept the fact that the United States of America elected a black Democratic president in 2008. These fringe elements of our political discourse could only hide the true sources of their rage for so long.</p>
<p>They are not a silent majority. They are an ugly angry minority which has corrupted the concept of libertarian freedoms in order to bash non-whites, gays, and anyone else who disagrees with them. Instead of embracing it, Republicans should be ashamed of such behavior. The tea partiers are the fascists that they claim Obama and the Democrats to be. This version of the tea party is not a movement for America?s future, but an ugly return to its dark past.</p>

<article id="0000317" published-at="2007-03-03" title="Dumbly"><p>The nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office recently issue a <a href="http://www.gao.gov/docsearch/abstract.php?rptno=GAO-07-42" type="external">blistering report</a> on the Department of Energy?s delinquent treatment of energy efficiency standards. Despite a mandate from Congress, DOE has missed all 34 deadlines for issues standards covering everything from consumer products to power transformers. Only 11 sets of standards have been completed; 23 remain unfinished.</p>
<p>Guess who gets screwed by this? Hint: it?s not industry:</p>
<p>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimates that delays in setting standards for the four consumer product categories that consume the most energy?refrigerators and freezers, central air conditioners and heat pumps, water heaters, and clothes washers?will cost at least $28 billion in forgone energy savings by 2030.</p>
<p>This is a travesty. Energy efficiency is the fastest, easiest, and cheapest way to fight global warming and achieve energy security. Greens have finally begun to unite around that message, but obviously there?s a long way to go to beat it into the heads of the feds.</p>

<article id="0000347" published-at="2015-08-07" title="The New Religious Right"><p>You all know what a cultural pessimist I am, so you must know what a big deal it was for me to come away from the day I spent in Nashville among the Southern Baptists (at the conference on the Gospel and politics, sponsored by the Ethics &amp;amp; Religious Liberty Commission) so optimistic about the future of the church and orthodox Christianity in this country. It?s a Russell Moore thing, I guess. The newish head of the ERLC is a refreshing combination of realism and optimism, which is something you don?t often see in my circles. He is quite realistic about the condition of American culture in this de-Christianizing era ? none of this old-line Religious Right, ?take back our country? rhetoric from him ? but optimistic in that he really believes that losing our illusions about the character of America is a good thing for Christianity. Though a social and religious conservative, Moore is happy that the days when his tribe could be considered the Republican Party at Prayer are over.</p>
<p>To be sure, it?s not that religious conservatives won?t vote Republican in reliable numbers. It?s rather that the 1980s-era model of the Religious Right is dead or dying, and with it, the nationalism that too often became a form of idolatry for religious conservatives. I?ll have more to say about this here soon, but I want to point out something that I learned while in Nashville, something that shows how much things have changed for the Southern Baptists and for religious conservatism in the past 30 years.</p>
<p>In talking with various Southern Baptists in Nashville, especially younger Gen Xers and Millennials, I met some who are conservatives, but who came out of an extremely strict, suffocating fundamentalism. I pointed out again and again that I have no experience of fundamentalism, and this explains the disconnect I have with many Evangelicals when talking about the Benedict Option. As I put it to one man, ?My experience of organized religion has always been loosey-goosey, which is why I seek doctrinal rigor and a deeper experience of ritual and practice.? The Southern Baptists with whom I spoke in Nashville also seek the same thing, but warned me (by telling about their histories) about how far in a destructive, unhealthy direction that kind of thing can go. I greatly appreciated their perspective, and know for sure that when I write the Benedict Option book, I?m going to have to devote a chapter to talking about the fundamentalist dead-end, and why we should avoid it.</p>
<p>My wife, who was raised in First Baptist Dallas, often cautions me about how Evangelicals hear my Ben Op talk. If they?ve been burned by fundamentalism, it sounds like what they ran away from, she said ? an insight that was confirmed over and over for me in Nashville.</p>
<p>As it turns out, First Baptist Dallas also revealed something to me about how both the Southern Baptist Convention, the Religious Right, and Evangelicalism have changed since my youth. Again, I had no direct experience of the world of the Reagan-era Religious Right, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChjmviRYkQg" type="external">but this 1988 documentary about that world, as seen through the world of First Baptist Dallas</a>, taught me a lot about where the Southern Baptist Convention is today, and how it got there.</p>
<p>I came to the documentary after having a brief conversation with someone in Nashville about W.A. Criswell, the late pastor of First Baptist Dallas, and an enormously influential figure in his day. It?s fascinating, really fascinating, to watch that two-part documentary. Follow the link, and fast-forward to the 45 minute mark; the First Baptist Dallas portrait is part two. My wife, as a young teenager, was part of the First Baptist world then, and has confirmed to me that the documentary is accurate, but incomplete; for all the faults the documentary reveals, it must be remembered, she said, that the people of that community were (and are) good men and women. I believe that. It?s far too easy for outsiders to demonize folks like this. Like most churches, or groups, there is good and bad present.</p>
<p>That said, it was genuinely shocking to me to watch the documentary and see the pageantry, the money, the Republicanism, the Americanism, and the fundamentalist triumphalism present in that community ? which was emblematic of the Religious Right. When I finished watching it in my hotel room, I thought, ?So that?s how we got Russell Moore.? The difference, both stylistically and substantively, between the SBC (and conservative Evangelicalism) of the Criswell era, and of the Moore era, is striking. Again, anybody who doubts it really should <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChjmviRYkQg" type="external">watch the documentary.</a></p>
<p>Contrast it with this passage from Moore?s new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Onward-Engaging-Culture-without-Losing/dp/1433686171/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1438964639&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=russell+moore" type="external">Onward: Engaging the Culture Without Losing the Gospel</a>:</p>
<p>And, congregationally speaking, Protestant liberalism is deader than Henry VIII. If adapting to the culture were the key to ecclesial success, then where are the Presbyterian Church (USA) church-planting movements, the Unitarian megachurches?</p>
<p>That said, the older generations are mistaken if they assume the next generation will be more of the same, just with even more prayer for ?revival? and ?Great Awakening? in the land. The typical younger pastor is less partisan than his <a href="" type="internal"></a>predecessor, less likely to speak from the pulpit about ?mobilizing? voters and ?reclaiming Judeo-Christian values? through political action and economic boycotts. This is not because he is evolving leftward. It is because he wants to keep Christianity Christian. As a matter of fact, the center of evangelical Christianity today is, theologically speaking, well to the right of the old Religious Right. It?s true that the typical younger pastor of a growing urban or suburban church doesn?t look like his cuff-linked or golf-shirted forefather. But that doesn?t mean he?s a liberal. He might have tattoos, yes, but they aren?t of Che Guevara. They?re of Hebrew passages from Deuteronomy.</p>
<p>His congregation?s statement of faith isn?t the generic sloganeering of the last generations? doctrinally oozy consumerist evangelical movements, but it likely a lengthy manifesto with points and subpoints and footnotes rooted in one of the great theological traditions of the historic church. This pastor might preach forty-five minutes to an hour, sometimes calling out backsliding Christians from the pulpit with all the force of hellfire-and-brimstone revivalists of yesteryear. He is pro-life and pro-marriage, although he is likely to speak of issues like homosexuality in theological and pastoral terms rather than in rhetoric warning of ?the gay agenda.?</p>
<p>Unlike the typical Bible Belt congregation of the twentieth century, the new kind of evangelical church has strict membership requirements, both in terms of what it takes to enter the believing community and what it takes to stay there. There aren?t likely to be four-year-olds baptized after repeating sinner?s prayers in a backyard Bible club, and the unrepentant often face what their parents never seemed to notice in their red-and-black lettered Bibles: excommunication. If this is liberalism, let?s have more of it.</p>
<p>These churches are often deeply culturally engaged, in terms of music and the arts, with often a more theologically-rich understanding of how to analyze common grace in cultural artifacts than the Christian subcultures of Bible Belt past, which too often replicated contemporary popular culture, at a lower level of quality, affixing Jesus at the end of it all. But they are often unsure of how to think of political engagement. Again, this is not due to liberalism but to theological conservatism. [Emphasis mine; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Crunchy-Cons-Conservative-Counterculture-Return-ebook/dp/B003DYGO7S/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1438966314&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=crunchy+cons" type="external">where have you heard this kind of thing before?</a> ? RD] They have seen social gospels of the Left and the Right try to package a transcendent message for decidedly this-worldly, and sometimes downright cynical, purposes of pulling the levers of political power.</p>
<p>I encourage you to read Onward, even if you aren?t an Evangelical, and to <a href="http://erlc.com/" type="external">connect with the ERLC</a>. I?m reading it now, and I find myself underlining passages, and saying, Yes, that?s how it is. Reading the Moore book, and meeting all these bright, engaged, young conservative Evangelicals in Nashville this week, gave me the feeling that we may well be at the beginning of something new and vigorous in American Christianity. It is widely recognized that the model of Christian engagement represented by the late Richard John Neuhaus, Chuck Colson, and their Evangelicals and Catholics Together circle ? the only example of culturally and politically engaged religious conservatism I?ve ever known ? is dead. But we don?t know what comes next. I could be wrong, but I think I saw what?s coming next. Russell Moore is the closest thing we have to a new Richard John Neuhaus, and a very different Chuck Colson. Whatever is coming next is going to be worked out among Catholics and Evangelicals drawn to Moore and his orbit. Patrick Deneen, Chad Pecknold, and some of my other new-generation Catholic friends need to break bread with Moore and his circle.</p>
<p>Talking in the hallway at the convention center with <a href="http://www.dennyburk.com/" type="external">Denny Burk</a>, he asked me how the Benedict Option differs from the church community he pastors. He described the way his congregation works, and from that description, I concluded that it sounds like I imagine the Benedict Option would work among Evangelicals. ?When I get started on this book, I want to come visit y?all and see how you do it,? I said to Denny. Part of the Benedict Option book will be visiting different communities and learning from them. This Wednesday in Nashville was an excellent start for me, and I?m really encouraged by meeting and spending time with so many new friends who are working toward the same goal, in fidelity to their own traditions.</p>
<p>If this resonates with you, come to the October 10 Benedict Option conference at Georgetown. It?s great simply to meet people who see the world as you do, and to learn from them. It gives me hope.</p></article>
<article id="0000350" title=""><p>I have been following the news all weekend and I think the Republican Party has a real problem on their hands. I am reminded about the saying ?You created this monster now do something about it? All these left wing nut cases are about to be too much. I am sure that when Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh and the Republican Party psyched these people up with their distortions and lies they had no idea that these narrow minded bigoted people would follow them to the extreme that they have.</p>
<p>Here is Frank Schaeffer of The Huffington Post talking about the dangers of right wing rhetoric on The Rachel Maddow Show:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Visit msnbc.com for <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com" type="external">Breaking News</a>, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032507" type="external">World News</a>, and <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032072" type="external">News about the Economy</a></p>
<p>So now all these people have been associated with the Republican Party. What?s a party to do? They can?t totally walk away from them because it is better than 50% of their support base. Then they can?t totally embrace them either. They could do what the congress lady from Illinois did last week (and what the Republicans have been doing all along) you know talk out of both sides of your mouth at the same time or you could just man up and be honest. The Republicans Extremist Dilemma</p>
<p>Nah these are Republicans we are dealing with. So they trot out their party chairman Micheal ?stephin flechet? Steele to come out and try his best to distance the Republican Party from them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This man is got to be the biggest joke and a major disappointment to Black people everywhere. So how do they defend themselves now? These nutcases and their 2nd amendment right to bear arms are going to go too far one day and somebody is going to get seriously hurt. It?s bound to happen. Then what will be Beck Limbaugh and thee Republicans excuse going to be? These southern rednecks are really taking over the Republican Party and they are literally driving it into the ground.</p>

<article id="0000351" published-at="2017-07-25" title="Senate gives early OK to bill regulating do-not-resuscitate orders"><p>The Senate on Tuesday gave early approval to a bill that would force physicians to take certain steps before issuing do-not-resuscitate orders to patients.</p>
<p>Senate Bill 11, authored by state Sen. <a href="" type="internal">Charles Perry</a>, R-Lubbock, passed the upper chamber in a 21-10 vote. The measure regulates the issuance of do-not-resuscitate orders, directives that instruct medical professionals not to perform certain life-sustaining actions if a patient goes into cardiac or respiratory arrest.</p>
<p>The bill seeks to ensure that a patient or the patient?s legal guardian gives consent before a doctor issues a do-not-resuscitate order. Perry said the intent is "to&amp;#160;engage patients' wishes and put families into that discussion and end the silent DNR process.?</p>
<p>At a committee hearing for the bill earlier in the session, opponents ? including the Texas Hospital Association ? criticized the legislation as too vague, arguing that it would needlessly complicate the DNR process.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. <a href="" type="internal">Become one</a>.</p>
<p>Though Perry voiced some support for amendments proposed on the floor, he formally opposed every one, saying stakeholder groups wouldn't agree to modifications to the bill at this stage. After state Sen. Juan " <a href="" type="internal">Chuy" Hinojosa</a>, D-McAllen, commented on Perry's deference to outside groups' input, Perry suggested some changes could be made in the House ? and that he had "made a decision to honor the stakeholders."&amp;#160;</p>
<p>The vote on SB 11 came in the midst of a marathon day in the upper chamber that showed no sign of winding down a few hours before midnight. The Senate took up several bills Tuesday, including controversial ?bathroom bill? legislation affecting transgender Texans, after Lt. Gov. <a href="" type="internal">Dan Patrick</a> warned lawmakers that it would be ?a late night."</p>
<p>The DNR measure needs final approval from the Senate before heading to the House for consideration. (Update, July 26: The bill has officially passed the Senate and will now head to the House.)</p>

<article id="0000367" title="Building A Jewish And Democratic State: A Conversation With Peter Beinart"><p>14 May, 2012 <a href="http://www.tikkun.org/nextgen/building-a-jewish-and-democratic-state-a-conversation-with-peter-beinart" type="external">Tikkun.org</a></p>
<p>Peter Beinart, formerly an editor of The New Republic, famous during most of the past thirty years for its support of many of the most right-wing policies of the State of Israel toward Palestinians and for its hostility toward American Jews supporting the Israeli peace movement, has caught the attention of U.S. media for his switch to a pro-peace perspective in the past few years. His book The Crisis of Zionism has stirred considerable controversy within the American Jewish community, to its credit.</p>
<p>Michael Lerner: You describe yourself as a Zionist in your new book The Crisis of Zionism, but today many people are not sure exactly what that means and assume that it means that Zionists are those who support the policies of the government of the State of Israel. What does Zionism mean?</p>
<p>Peter Beinart: I?m a political Zionist. I believe that the Jewish people need a democratic Jewish state in some portion of the ancient Land of Israel. The history of Jewish persecution in the Diaspora made it important to have a Jewish state of refuge for Jews around the world, a state which is a cultural center for Jews, a center whose language is Hebrew which has historically provided a bond among Jewish communities around the world and which today is central to a renaissance of Jewish thinking and creativity, and whose founding principles (as embodied in Israel?s declaration of independence) proclaim complete equality for all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, nationality, or sex. I believe that a state set up on those principles within the pre-1967 borders of Israel has the capacity to embody those goals.</p>
<p>Lerner: How do you respond to some on the Left who acknowledge the need of the Jewish people for safety but doubt that such a state should be in Palestine where there was already a culture and a people with a long history of their own and who got supplanted by the Jews moving there? Why not create such a state from the territory of those who previously oppressed Jews?</p>
<p>Beinart: I wouldn?t support a state whose founding principles only gave full citizenship to Jews. The denial of equal rights does take place across the Green Line but inside the Green Line (pre-1967 borders), Arabs have full voting rights, participate in the Knesset and on the Supreme Court, and that is a basis upon which to build. Why build a Jewish homeland in pre-state Palestine rather than Easter Europe? Because you cannot deny the Jewish historical connection to that part of the world. To deny it is to deny Judaism itself. But that historical connection should not exclude a Palestinian state on some of that same territory nor should it exclude individual human rights.</p>
<p>Lerner: But there was another people living there!</p>
<p>Beinart: That?s why we need to share the land with them. They need to have national rights within their own state, a Palestinian national flag and national anthem, and the right of return to a Palestinian state. Plus they need to have full individual rights within the State of Israel. When those two things happen, they will constitute a ?completion? of the Zionist project, because they will assure that the people who share the land with the Jewish people have the same national and individual rights that the Jews have.</p>
<p>Lerner: Would it be acceptable in your mind to have a democratic Israel if through demographic changes a majority of Israelis were Palestinians? Or would you say that to preserve its Jewish character it would be permissible to infringe on its democratic character?</p>
<p>Beinart: It would be wrong for Israel to take any coercive measure to reduce its Arab population. But I would hope that the state you describe would remain a state committed to providing safety for the Jewish people around the world when they are in grave danger. We are a long way away from the time when an Israeli state would have an Arab majority, but if Israelis thought that was about to happen, I would oppose any measures (such as expulsion of Arabs) designed to coercively impose a Jewish majority.</p>
<p>Lerner: If safety is central, then some people argue that the Jewish people would be better to pitch their tents in the U.S. or some other Western state, rather than in the Middle East surrounded by hundreds of thousands of Arabs and Muslims, many of them now very angry at the Jewish people and the Jewish State for what they perceive to be harsh and arrogant treatment of their own family, the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>Beinart: These are counterfactuals you wish me to address. Jews are there now and very unlikely to be willing to move. If we think of what might have happened if Israel had not been created, there might have been many more Jews who would be without a home today, from some of the Holocaust survivors to some Ethiopian Jews, possibly some Russian and Sephardic Jews. But there is no question that the wars that Israel has fought have produced animosity in the Arab world. Yet that is not entirely Israel?s fault. There has been an unwillingness on the part of Arabs countries and the Palestinian national leadership to accept a Jewish state in the Middle East. But there has been some progress in that regard as represented by the Arab Peace Initiative in recent years which accepts Israel?s existence along the pre-1967 borders with some changes mutually agreed upon and some solution to the refugee problem.</p>
<p>Lerner: The Arab Peace Initiative of 2002, re-released in 2007, were not even responded to by the Israeli government. We reported in the pages of Tikkun how Arab leaders asked us to explain why, even if Israel disagreed over some parts of the position being offered, it did not then respond with some counter-proposal. Instead, while Israel claims that there is no one to negotiate with, some twenty Arab and Muslim states have their proposal totally ignored.</p>
<p>Beinart: This was a big mistake that the Israeli government did not respond and that does give some grounds for pessimism. But it?s also true that Ehud Olmert in his negotiations with the Palestinian Authority had given ground and made proposals that are much more forthcoming than any previous government, negotiating very seriously with Abbas, and that someone from Likud could make as many moves toward ending Israeli settlements in the West Bank is a grounds for hope.</p>
<p>Lerner: In Embracing Israel/Palestine, the argument is presented that no political agreement will work unless there is a change of consciousness in both societies. But the peace forces in Israel have been on a major decline in Israel in the past ten years, even though in the past five years there have been no major acts of violence from the Palestinian Authority and there has been a discourse of non-violence from Abbas and the Palestinian leadership. That the peace movement has gotten less support in this period rather than more, the decline of peace voices inside the Labor Party and the decline of Meretz?s electoral base of support, is a fact used by Hamas to argue that Israelis will remain self-satisfied and do nothing for peace when the times are non-violent, and only respond to acts of violence.</p>
<p>Beinart: Yes, this is a problem, though we must note that while there has been a decline of violence from the West Bank, there does continue to be violence toward southern Israel coming from Gaza, which has been traumatic for people who live there. I agree with you that it is worrisome that the Netanyahu government?s unwillingness to negotiate toward a Palestinian state or to stop settlement construction to make negotiations possible contributes to undermining Abbas and does make it easier for Hamas to say ?the Israeli only understand violence.? That is a tragic logic that can only make things worse for both sides. I still take some hope from the fact that Olmert, raised in the revisionist movement and deeply infused with its worldview, was able to make the generous offers that he made to Abbas which in some respects went considerably further than the Labor Party was prepared to go in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Lerner: Unfortunately that did not include being willing to take generous steps toward the Palestinian refugees, though they remain one of the three central issues (along with the issue of the borders of the Palestinian and Israeli states and the status of Jerusalem). Tikkun has argued that it will take a spirit of generosity toward the refugees to make it possible for there to be a serious outcome to negotiations.</p>
<p>Beinart: That all depends on what you mean by generosity. It is reported that Palestinian President Abbas accepted the principle that refugee return should not threaten the existence of the State of Israel. The formula will most likely a relatively small return by original refugees who are now getting relatively elderly now to Israel?s pre-1967 Israel?perhaps 20,000 or 50,000 or 100,000, but a number that would not seriously threaten Israel?s demographics, plus a public Israeli statement of acknowledgment of the sufferings of Palestinians which would be very important to Palestinians, plus a concerted international effort to resettle Palestinian refugees (particularly those who are especially suffering in Lebanon and Syria), and for other countries around the world to take some of those refugees into their own borders. The solution will require a global effort, but if Palestinians get a state with a capital in Jerusalem, that will give Palestinian leaders the political cover to accept something less than a large scale ?right of return.?</p>
<p>Lerner: We at Tikkun have suggested that Israel take in twenty to thirty thousand refugees each year for the next thirty years, because at the expectable growth rate of populations that number would not undermine the demographic balance and yet would appear to be a rather significant act of atonement. What can pro-Israel progressives do to transform our own Jewish community so it would move in the direction we both support?</p>
<p>Beinart: I think we must reach them with an understanding that they have a stake in what happens in Israel, and that they have a stake in changing the direction of American Jewish institutions which today are supporting Israel in the wrong way (namely in supporting its governmental policies rather than supporting Israel to be the state whose founding democratic principles need to become the guiding principles of contemporary policy). I think we should make the case to younger Jews, even if they feel quite distant from Israel, or even alienated from Israel, that Israel is the great test of Jewish power and their whole experience of Judaism will be shaped by whether Jews meet that test, and that they need to stop thinking that they can absent themselves from that struggle and find some way to re-engage with the American Jewish community in order to shape how that community impacts on American and Israeli policy.</p>
<p>Lerner: There is not a lot of evidence that the organized Jewish community is open to that kind of influence by its younger members. Some even argue that the community is organized not on the principle of one person / one vote but on one dollar / one vote.</p>
<p>Beinart: Well not only old people have money. Moreover, if you get active and put in the time in these organizations, you eventually get taken seriously. But in the past year the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee have been willing to take quite critical stances toward Israeli policies or laws that undermine democratic principles. That suggests to me, as some people inside these organizations contend, that there is a lively struggle in a few of these mainstream institutions about how to respond to actions in Israel that undermine fundamental democratic principles, and that these organizations may be encouraged to see Israel more through the prism of their own founding principles that were very much pro-civil liberties and democratic rights.</p>
<p>Lerner: We?ve heard the stories of ?the Jewish community is really open now in a new way? many times before, most recently when the Jewish Federation of San Francisco hired the founding director of the Progressive Jewish Alliance Daniel Sokatch to be their own executive director, and accompanied that with statements that seemed to promise a new openness. But when Daniel Sokatch objected to the desire of the board to stop funding the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival two years ago because the Film Festival had allowed a film to be shown about the way that Rachel Corrie was killed by Israeli bulldozers seeking to tear down Palestinian homes, he found that he had to leave his job only a year or so after having arrived with great expectations of a new openness. Sokatch is now the executive director of the New Israel Fund, and the Federation is just as stuck as ever. Perhaps even more so, because it, along with many other Jewish institutions, have banned Jewish Voices for Peace from holding events in any institution which receives Jewish Federation monies. The decision throughout much of the organized Jewish community to exclude anyone who supports BDS has given the exact opposite message to one of inclusion and openness. This message is that even if you agree with Israel?s right to exist as a Jewish State, you are banned from participating or holding meetings in our facilities if you hold a pro-BDS perspective.</p>
<p>Beinart: Given that BDS has been advocated for by many who do not support the existence of the State of Israel?s right to exist, this raises important questions about whether one has to be open to those who want the end of the State of Israel.</p>
<p>Lerner: Yes, that?s why Tikkun doesn?t support the BDS movement toward the State of Israel, but only the more limited BDS toward the products produced in the Israeli settlements or by corporations working with the Israeli government to enforce the Occupation of the West Bank, the same position you take publicly. But though I disagree with the BDS perspective, I do not believe it is legitimate to claim to be a supporter of democratic processes and then exclude positions with which I disagree from being able to be expressed inside the institutions of which I am a part. So this kind of behavior on their part by the Jewish institutions sends a strong message that is not open to a serious discussion of how most effectively to change Israeli policies or to influence them from the Diaspora.</p>
<p>Beinart: I agree with you. I think there is a basic hypocrisy here. We exclude people who do not want Israel to be a Jewish state, but we do not exclude people who don?t support Israel being a democratic state! There are many on the Right whose policies would lead to a permanent occupation and annexation of the West Bank without giving Palestinians equal rights with Jews. We should be consistent on this. So there is a paradox in the direction of the American Jewish community. On the one hand you have the emergence of J Street, which has received some critiques from the organized Jewish community but has been received with far greater tolerance than, say, the way Breyra was received several decades ago in 1977. J Street has had prominent members of the Israeli establishment, including Ehud Olmert, come to speak.</p>
<p>Lerner: In your recent widely discussed book The Crisis of Zionism, you mention that Ehud Barak?s supposedly ?generous offer? to the Palestinians at Camp David in 2000 involved Israel seeking to annex the land on which 80 percent of settlers live, and for that ?Israel would have to annex settlements like Ariel, Immanuel, Kfar Adumim, Ofra and Beit El, which sit deep in the heart of the West Bank. And close observers fear that if Israel tried to incorporate many fewer than 80 percent of the settlers, the result might be civil war.? What is the right way to deal with the issue of the settlers?</p>
<p>Beinart: Well, when you?ve dug yourself into a hole, the first obvious thing to do is to stop digging. Stop designating places in the West Bank as national priority zones for Israel?e.g., the decision by the Netanyahu government to build a cultural center in Kiryat Arba, one of the most radical settlements in the West Bank. Then you?d want to think seriously about the American Jewish community creating a fund to help settlers move back inside Israel. Why not make this process easier even before you cut the deal with the Palestinians? This has been made more difficult by the way that those settlers pulled out of Gaza were handled, which makes other settlers more skeptical that they will actually be taken care of should a deal be worked out with the Palestinians. Though Israel will try to annex as much as it can, it is not going to be able to annex the 8 percent that Barak sought including everything inside the ?separation barrier.? It will probably be 34 percent of the West Bank. And then the world is going to have to get involved in creating a generous fund to help settlers move back within the Green Line. Those who want to stay should have the right to stay in their homes in the West Bank as Palestinian citizens, but there is going to have to be a very clear understanding of what it means to live in a Palestinian state without IDF protection, plus there is likely to be legal issues that we will face for those who have built their settlements on Palestinian land. So while I think it important that settlers have the right to stay, I think at the end of the day not that many will opt to stay.</p>
<p>Lerner: We?ve taken that same position for several decades now in Tikkun. We?ve also addressed the issue from the standpoint of those religious settlers who believe that there is a Hallakhic requirement for Jews to settle and live in all parts of the Biblical ?Eretz Yisra?el.? We point out that that Hallakhic mitzvah can be fulfilled by living in Eretz Yisra?el but under a Palestinian government, because there is no hallakhic rule that says the injunction to live in Eretz Yisra?el can only be fulfilled while living under a Jewish secular state?s government. It does not say that either in the Torah, the Talmud or the Shluchan Arukh.</p>
<p>Beinart: A good point. Jews were living in Eretz Yisra?el for all of the past 2,000 years and not under a Jewish government.</p>
<p>Lerner: So how do you suggest we deal with the Palestinian claim of a ?right of return?? What is the right way to deal with Palestinian refugees?</p>
<p>Beinart: I understand why many Palestinians argue that they and their children and grandchildren have a right to return. But as a practical matter it would not be the best path to peace to have some kind of massive return that would throw Israel into turmoil and threaten its character as a Jewish state. According to Saeb Erekat, as reported in Palestinian newspapers, the Palestinian position is that Israel must accept 150,000 returnees, whereas former Israeli prime minister Olmert?s position while negotiating with the Palestinians was much much lower than that. I would hope that the number would be lower than 100,000. That?s still fewer people than the number of Palestinians who would no longer be Israeli citizens if the agreement also includes making the Palestinian neighborhoods of East Jerusalem part of a Palestinian state. So I imagine 50,000 to 75,000 Palestinians coming to Israel over the course of the next several years, and I?d imagine prioritizing those Palestinians who are in the most dire circumstances?e.g., those living in refugee camps in Lebanon. One would have to give Palestinian refugees a menu of options, one of which would be returning to the Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, and there would need to be a real international effort to resettle Palestinians and give them decent economic lives, and there would have to an international effort to help Palestinians who have family or connections in other countries to be able to relocate and settle there as well. In short, there would have to be a menu of options to deal with this problem.</p>
<p>Lerner: Tikkun has advocated for a return of 20,000 Palestinians each year for the next 30 years, a total of 900,000 returnees but done at a pace that would not threaten the political balance between Palestinians and Israelis within Israel, yet would recognize the extreme injustice done to the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>Beinart: I hadn?t known of that perspective. It might not be so attractive to those who want to solve this problem in the short run, because it would keep the solution going for thirty years. I don?t know how satisfying it would be to some Palestinians to be told ?you can come to Israel in twenty-five years.? But I think that the general principle of not changing the demographic balance while some recognition of the rights of refugees should be followed, however one deals with the practicalities.</p>
<p>Lerner: J Street on its website asserts, ?J Street believes that Iran obtaining nuclear weapons would pose a very serious threat to American and Israeli interests and to peace and stability in the Middle East and around the world.? Do you agree with that position?</p>
<p>Beinart: Yes, I agree with that. Iran getting a nuclear weapon?it would shift the power balance in the Middle East toward Iran, which is run by a malevolent group which has suppressed its own people and whose values I deeply abhor, and has supported forces like Hezbollah and Hamas (though Iran is a little less connected to Hamas than it was). And Iran?s acquiring nuclear weapons would encourage the Saudis and the Egyptians to similarly seek to acquire nuclear weapons. So I think that we should do whatever we can that is constructive to try to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. I don?t think that a military attack on Iran is a constructive response, but do support efforts to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Lerner: Why not use the strategy of ?mutually assured destruction? with Iran as we did successfully with the Soviet Union?Iran would certainly know that any first use of the bomb against Israel or the U.S. would lead to Iran?s destruction by massive nuclear retaliation?</p>
<p>Beinart: There was no realistic possibility for the U.S. to stop the Soviet Union from getting nuclear weapons. There is such a possibility with Iran through a combination of sanctions and diplomacy you could stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon (though they still might have some nuclear capacity but not a weapon).</p>
<p>Lerner: J Street recently honored the launch of your new book at its conference in 2012. Are there any ways in which you do not feel fully aligned with its policy positions?</p>
<p>Beinart: J Street?s fundamental constituency is the U.S. Congress. J Street was created because for a long time the political dynamics in Congress have made it difficult for an American Administration to exercise leadership in trying to bring to fruition a two-state solution that we need, and J Street believed that it could provide political cover to some in Congress who would urge the Administration to take positions that would be more in the best self-interest of both Israel and America?namely, ending the Occupation and creating a two-state solution that allows Israel to survive as both a Jewish and democratic state. So I don?t blame them for focusing on what kinds of policy positions will work within the particular constituency of the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>As a journalist, I, like those of you at Tikkun, don?t have to tread so cautiously in regard to Congress, and so I can say that I did not think that the U.S. should veto at the United Nations a resolution on settlements ( particularly since the U.S. position is in fact against settlement growth) and we should have supported that position at the United Nations. J Street didn?t take that position. We have a different role than J Street, which is trying to shift the debate in Congress, so we have more freedom than they do.</p>
<p>Lerner: One disturbing aspect of J Street is that it makes the argument for ending the Occupation and helping the Palestinians create an economically and politically viable state solely in terms of what is best for Israel?s interests. We at Tikkun believe it important to also include in the discussion as equally important in God?s eyes and humanity?s eyes the suffering of the Palestinian people, recognizing them as equally to the Jews created in God?s image, and equally to the Jews deserving of being treated with full respect and dignity (as we hold should be the way everyone on the planet should be treated).</p>
<p>Beinart: That is a very important question and something I wrestle with as well. The suffering of the Palestinian people is immensely important and has had a significant influence on me personally. But there is a different question about what is the most effective way to talk to the American Jewish community. I find that when I speak in that community, people really want to know that you have a special commitment to the Jewish people, that you are ?inside the tent,? and that a purely universalist argument can be somewhat alienating for people. And since I do feel a very special connection to the Jewish people, as I know you do too, and since I?m not purely a universalist, and I struggle to balance my universalist commitments with my own particularism, my support for universal human rights but also my sense that I have special obligations to my people, just as I have obligations to my family which sometimes come first, that I find it more effective to speak not just about our self-interest as a people but also our honor, our sense of ourselves and what our purpose is, and I find that a more effective way to start these kinds of difficult conversations inside the American Jewish community.</p>
<p>Lerner: The spiritual well-being of the Jewish people requires the ability to identify with the suffering of others, and the mistaken notion that ?Never Again? means never again only for the Jews not to ever have to suffer hatred, racism and genocide, has led a spiritual crisis or at least a crisis contraction in what Jews used to be. There is something in the Jewish tradition that would lead us to say, as it does in the Torah, ve?ahavta la?ger, ?You shall love the Other (the stranger).? The catering to the ?we are all family and should give priority to the needs of our family? which is, as you have pointed out, the underlying assumption which leads J Street to adopt the discourse it does, has the possible consequence of leading the Jewish people away from its own spiritual core just in the way that the settlers and their approach to Judaism does. So this approach on the part of J Street, while it may be effective in Congress, may actually be detrimental to our people.</p>
<p>Beinart: I find a lot to which I resonate when you speak, and it reminded me that when I was a teenager I bought the first issue of Tikkun at a newsstand in Harvard Square when I was in high school, and I read it a lot. I was very struck by the way you pointed out how frequently in Torah there is this explicit injunction to care for the well-being of ?the Other? and the Jews knowing the heart of the stranger. That became a very important part of my own sense of what it is to be Jewish.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I have to say that when I look at the orthodox community where there is the highest level of Jewish education and commitment as measured by synagogue attendance and ritual observance, yet they do not identify with the values that you emphasize. I don?t feel comfortable suggesting that they are in any way in a spiritual crisis. I do disagree with the political and moral currents that are in the ascendancy in the Orthodox community, but can I say that they are in spiritual crisis? When I sit around the Shabbat table with Orthodox Jews, I don?t sense I?m with people who are in spiritual crisis, I see people who are living a really spiritually rich life and a very attractive life in a lot of ways to me?I just don?t see them as ethically and politically where I wish them to be, but I don?t know that I could say that they are in spiritual crisis.</p>
<p>Lerner: We at Tikkun don?t accept the division or ability to separate a spiritual life from an ethically coherent life. One last question: we sent out an email to the large number of people on our lists in which we endorsed the position taken in Embracing Israel/Palestine of a targeted BDS (boycott, divestment, and sanctions) against products made in West Bank settlements and against corporations that build or supply products or material used by the IDF specifically to enhance or support the Occupation. This is the position taken by you, Peter Beinart, in your own recent writings, and it is virtually the same position taken by many in the Methodist and Presbyterian worlds (though they have falsely been accused of supporting a more general BDS against the State of Israel, and though even this limited BDS was recently defeated at the 2012 conference of the United Methodist Church of the USA). While we got a range of responses as we always do on Israel-related issues, one such was particularly troubling. It said something like this: In Embracing Israel/Palestine (EIP), you argue that it is critical to peace to have people recognize that both the Israeli and Palestinian people are suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and that PTSD cannot be healed through coercion, an argument that EIP uses to argue against a broader BDS against Israel. But won?t even this more narrow BDS feel coercive to Israelis, and open up the opportunity for the Netanyahus and Liebermans and Baraks to say: ?See, the whole world is against us, so we have no choice but to strengthen our defenses against the rest of the world because they will betray us as everyone in the past has always done to the Jewish people.?</p>
<p>Beinart: It is a reasonable critique of the position. My biggest concern about the targeted BDS is that it can cut off dialogue when dialogue is really needed. So I worry about this too. But there is a need for there to be some way to both affirm the existence of the State of Israel and to provide an alternative to the BDS movement which is likely to grow and grow (based in part on my guess that there is not going to be a US-led peace process like we had in the 1990s). The BDS movement is largely one-state oriented, and does not affirm Israel?s right to exist. This is what led me to propose this. I think it?s important that the Palestinian Authority is supporting a settlement boycott and NOT a boycott against the whole State of Israel, because the PA is non-violent and for a two-state solution.</p>
<p>Lerner: Another weakness of the targeted approach at the moment is that it is often hard to identify which products are in fact made in West Bank settlements and which are not, since Israel resists labeling them as such.</p>
<p>Beinart: The European Union has been trying to get Israel to explicitly label products made in the West Bank. Israel doesn?t want to label those products explicitly, and that of course makes it harder for us to make the case for a more targeted boycott and gives strength to the BDS movement that seeks to boycott all of Israel. There have been companies that have moved from the West Bank into Israel, so there have been some successes from the targeted BDS movement so far.</p>

<article id="0000394" published-at="2012-05-18" title="Occupy: Nucleus of the New Society?"><p>Many Occupy supporters on the Left express concern that it could be coopted by the mainstream institutional Left and harnessed to a political agenda of NPR liberalism. The recent prominence of Van Johnson?s Rebuild the Dream and MoveOn.org seems to provide at least superficial justification for such fears. But those fears are groundless ? mainly because there?s no official Occupy ?movement? to be coopted.</p>
<p>Sure, liberals are free to use the Occupy label to promote their agenda. That is, after all, what Occupy?s all about: A brand, or platform, ready-made for adoption on a modular basis by anyone who sees fit to use it. The more different groups using the Occupy brand, each with its own anti-corporate agenda, the better. It?s not a zero sum game.</p>
<p>The beauty of Occupy is that its module/platform architecture, and its openness to anyone who wants to create a new node for their own purposes, make it an ideal laboratory for experimentation in revolutionary praxis. Any local node is free to try out new ways of doing things, and to share its experience with others; the new techniques are freely available to any other node in the network that finds them useful. No permission, no administrative coordination to make sure everybody?s on the same page, is needed at any step in the process.</p>
<p>It?s the same kind of stigmergic platform as Wikipedia, a Linux developer group ? or Al Qaeda Iraq. Self-selected individuals and local groups make contributions to praxis entirely on their own initiative, the smallest contribution can be leveraged with no transaction cost, and all contributions immediately become the common property of the entire movement.</p>
<p>I?ve hoped for some time that Occupy would cease to be mainly a protest movement and instead become mainly a school of living. That is, that ? like the neighborhood assemblies in Argentina ten years ago ? it would become a venue for local communities to disseminate the skills and technologies for building counter-institutions and a counter-economy that could flourish outside the decaying neoliberal system.</p>
<p>Some early signs in this direction were teach-ins like those of Juliet Schor (author of Plenitude) and Michel Bauwens of the Foundation for P2P Alternatives. Another was the ?Occupy Our Homes? campaign, which offered some promise of evolving into a nationwide squatter movement to reclaim vacant housing. The term for things like this is ?prefigurative politics?: That is, rather than attempting to pressure the power structure of the existing society for reforms, they exemplify the successor society in formation.</p>
<p>This spring, we see renewed occasion for hope. For example Occupy the Farm has occupied the Gill Tract, a vacant five-acre tract of land near the UC Berkeley campus slated for commercial development, and is cultivating it to raise food for the community.</p>
<p>All kinds of other counter-economic projects are available for Occupy to adopt. One of them is the kind of repair cafe that?s being pioneered in Amsterdam, as a way for low-income people to keep their broken appliances in use. The same general idea, neighborhood workshops and repair centers using the members? shared tools and skills as a base for subsistence outside the cash nexus for the unemployed and underemployed, has been around at least since Colin Ward and Karl Hess.</p>
<p>Another variant of the same idea is the hackerspaces in many communities around the United States. Local digital barter currencies, on the same basic architecture as Tom Greco?s mutual credit clearing systems, are springing up all over the country. Open source machine tools, like those under development by the hardware hackers at the Open Source Ecology project, can produce factory quality goods at a two-order-of-magnitude reduction in cost. Soil-intensive horticultural techniques can feed one person on a tenth of an acre.</p>
<p>The human capital built up by Occupy in local communities has great potential as a clearinghouse for sharing and promoting such projects, and as a seed around which the new society and the new economy can crystallize.</p>
<p>As my friend Rose Anderson stated in a recent discussion:</p>
<p>?The unmitigated greed of the 1% unintentionally forced a paradigm shift while no one was looking?. The jobs aren?t coming back, but as this situation drags on the number of people figuring out they don?t have to wait on the government and corporations will be the most perfect storm of societal change ever inadvertently created ? Occupy is just the beginning.?</p>
<p>Exactly. The real potential of Occupy is not to pressure Congress to adopt Obama?s infrastructure program, or the Buffett Rule, or any of the other shiboleths of ?Progressive? politics. It is, rather, to serve as the nucleus of the new society in being.</p>

<article id="0000408" published-at="2015-07-29" title="USA?s Mr. Robot actually does everything True Detective pretends to do"><p>A lot of the time, when you talk to fans of this troubled season of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2356777/?ref_=nv_sr_1" type="external">True Detective</a> and ask them what, precisely, they still see in the show, you'll eventually get down to something like this: Stories about what it means to be a man in American culture aren't exactly infrequent, but they've always been popular for good reason. (Here's a version of that argument, <a href="http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/review-has-true-detective-fallen-victim-to-the-sophomore-slump#520707" type="external">in internet comment form</a>.) Men are forever defining themselves against some weird, hidden code of masculinity that supposedly their grandfathers had access to but they can't seem to crack.</p>
<p>But True Detective is a lousy example of that, especially this season. The show can't make its mind up as to whether toxic masculinity is imprisoning its characters (like closeted gay veteran Paul Woodrugh) or providing their only escape from a culture with less and less room for them (as when, say, criminal Frank re-embraces his darkest self and pummels underlings into submission or worse). The show's attitude toward this topic, like everything else in season two, is confused.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So let me suggest something else: Literally everything fans say they want from True Detective is being done much better by a ridiculously titled show on the USA Network about a computer hacker: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/?ref_=nv_sr_1" type="external">Mr. Robot</a>. The show, which airs new episodes on Wednesdays and is available <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2Fmr-robot" type="external">on Hulu</a>, is one of the best in years about what it means to be a man in modern America.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Christian Slater plays the titular Mr. Robot. Rami Malek (left) is the main character, though. (USA)</p>
<p>Mr. Robot's closest antecedent is David Fincher's film version of Chuck Palahniuk's novel <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/?ref_=nv_sr_1" type="external">Fight Club</a>. Both stories are about a young man who feels ensnared by a superficial, glib society that refuses to engage with the forces behind the scenes manipulating everything that happens. In both works, that young man is joined by an older compatriot who encourages him to fight back against the system. And in both works, that older man just might be a figment of his imagination. (In Mr. Robot, he's the titular character, played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000225/?ref_=tt_cl_t5" type="external">Christian Slater</a>.)</p>
<p>Fight Club is an often brilliant, deeply flawed, enormously influential film. Its depiction of men who are choked out by IKEA catalogs and a world that holds them back from engaging their most violent impulses has proved to be one of the most enduring in modern filmmaking. Tellingly, many of the film's fans missed its bleak satire, choosing instead to read the film's climax (in which the hero blows up the credit industry) as a kind of wish fulfillment.</p>
<p>What's made Mr. Robot such an interesting riff on this idea is that Elliot, the hacker hero brilliantly played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1785339/?ref_=tt_cl_t1" type="external">Rami Malek</a>, is tempted both by the world of anarchy that, presumably, he would rule with his coolly intellectual and rigorous approach to problem solving and the world of creature comforts represented by Starbucks vanilla lattes and beautiful apartments.</p>
<p><q>The hacker hero is tempted both by the world of anarchy and the world of creature comforts</q></p>
<p>He can't have both. To give in to the former (by tearing apart Evil Corp, the corporation his cybersecurity firm, Allsafe, contracts for) would destroy the lives of many he cares about. To give in to the latter would mean always knowing that a massive, invisible web is manipulating him and everyone he knows to desire certain things.</p>
<p>See, the center of <a href="http://www.usanetwork.com/mrrobot" type="external">Mr. Robot</a> is all about the ways the information age has allowed corporations and government entities to know seemingly everything about us and use that information to constantly feed us a stream of new things to want and shallow needs to fulfill. You can't realize how trapped you are if you're always chasing some new, minor bauble.</p>
<p>We have a tendency to define the masculine ideal (at least in storytelling terms) as standing up and doing whatever it takes to achieve some material goal, whether it's winning more land or saving the girl or collecting a big payday. What Mr. Robot suggests is that a world so ruled by a gigantic, unseen web fundamentally can't allow these sorts of victories to exist. Thus, we sub in Starbucks as a kind of mild palliative on an unhealed wound. Elliot sees finding these barely hidden wounds as finding the "malware" in the people around him, using it to find a way to force them to do his bidding. It's sociopathic, maybe, but he also seems to think it's more honest.</p>
<p>And yet to tear everything down would be to rip apart the few actual connections he has.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tyrell (Martin Wallstr?m) offers up a sharp counterpoint to Elliot. (USA)</p>
<p>Elliot's struggles are thrown into even sharper relief by the character of Tyrell ( <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0909412/?ref_=tt_cl_t4" type="external">Martin Wallstr?m</a>), an Evil Corp employee. Everything we learn about Tyrell suggests he's offering up a kind of performative masculinity, a version of being a man that he can carefully schedule on a clock (to the degree that he pays homeless people so he can beat them up when he's got a few minutes to kill).</p>
<p>If Elliot seems stuck by his indecision, then Tyrell has fully committed to trying to find a way to serve both masters. He pushes and pushes for what he wants, and he even goes to a club to seduce a male co-worker, either because he's a closeted bisexual or because he's using the man toward some workplace end ? or (most likely) both.</p>
<p><q>The game is rigged against you, but you still have to play</q></p>
<p>But Tyrell knows as surely as Elliot does that everything around them is controlled by the data they leave trailing in their wake, that they are collections of information just waiting to be exploited by some corporate overlord or another. Still, Tyrell is ostensibly better at hiding in plain sight than the obviously spooked Elliot. He has the big apartment. He has the impressive job. He has the beautiful wife. He has all the creature comforts, but he still takes those appointments to beat up the homeless. Those "fights" are in keeping with the show's buzzy, paranoid, melancholy tone ? the game is rigged against you, but you still have to play.</p>
<p>We spend very little time with Tyrell, but what little time we do spend suggests he's like Elliot in almost every way, just better at denying both his fears and his desires. The more that he peels back the layers, the more darkness he finds, where Elliot increasingly seems tortured by a pesky conscience he can't quite hear.</p>
<p>Like the men of True Detective, both Elliot and Tyrell are struggling to find room for themselves in the modern landscape. Unlike those men, though, the show they inhabit is so much more clear-eyed about the strengths and weaknesses of their respective approaches.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Angela (Portia Doubleday) is a surprisingly vibrant character on Mr. Robot. (USA)</p>
<p>When it comes down to it, what ultimately sets Mr. Robot apart is the way that it pays attention to the characters in its world who aren't your typical cable drama heroes. Creator <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1322753/?ref_=nv_sr_1" type="external">Sam Esmail</a> has a keen eye for those on the edges of his show's universe.</p>
<p>Most of Mr. Robot's hacker crew, for instance, is made up of members of racial minorities and other societal subsets who have real reason to want to tear down the system and start anew, while Elliot's boss at Allsafe is a gay man who offers up a lovely example of what uncomplicated domesticity might look like for our hero.</p>
<p>In particular, however, the show's women are all interesting figures in their own right. Elliot might be infatuated with a couple of them, but they're not presented as prizes to be won but, instead, as people trying to navigate a system horribly rigged against them. Fellow hacker Darlene ( <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3361199/?ref_=tt_cl_t2" type="external">Carly Chaikin</a>) wouldn't mind seeing the world burn, while Elliot's eventual girlfriend, Shayla ( <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1951390/?ref_=nv_sr_1" type="external">Frankie Shaw</a>), seems similarly frustrated by there being no real middle road between chaos and order.</p>
<p><q>She's either a paragon of virtue or a fool. The show doesn't dare lean one way or another.</q></p>
<p>But it's Elliot's childhood friend, Angela ( <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0234668/?ref_=tt_cl_t3" type="external">Portia Doubleday</a>), who offers the series' most intriguing portrait of femininity trapped in this unbearable system. She, like, Elliot is a computer genius, but she's continually underestimated both at work and in her personal relationships. She's had her life torn apart so many times, as early as her childhood, when her mother died from cancer caused by chemical contamination.</p>
<p>Yet she keeps pushing for something better within the system, keeps believing that doing her best and working for something more will ultimately result in a slightly more hospitable world, despite all the evidence to the contrary. She's either a paragon of virtue or a fool, and the show doesn't dare lean one way or the other.</p>
<p>If Angela existed on True Detective, she would be so far off to the side of the show's darkly masculine, woozily cynical worldview that she'd barely be a blip. But on Mr. Robot she's not only allowed to exist. She's allowed to stand for something. What ultimately makes Mr. Robot such a good show about being a man is that it understands that men don't live in a vacuum, no matter how much other shows might like to pretend otherwise.</p>
<p>Mr. Robot airs Wednesdays at 10 pm Eastern <a href="http://www.usanetwork.com/mrrobot" type="external">on USA</a>.

<article id="0000409" title="CAN US CITIZENS DEFEAT UN TROOPS ON AMERICA SOIL?"><p>The establishment is practicing to defeat rogue American units who will fight to defend the people in the coming martial law subjugation enforced by foreign troops from the United Nations in UWEX 16.</p>
<p>Troops at Ft. Carson will be working with foreign troops to defeat civilian forces with COMBAT TROOPS.</p>
<p>Foreign mercenaries are training in Northern Colorado to defeat Guerrilla forces consisting of American citizens.</p>
<p>Denver Internation Airport just conducted a mock Guerrilla raid on the airport.</p>
<p>Foreign troops from Poland and Denmark are training for mass incarceration and gun confiscation at Camp Grayling in Michigan.</p>
<p>The above stories will be covered in the next release of the Red List News. For now, these stories illustrate that the current Junta running DC is preparing to fight American citizens in a guerrilla war and we are the Viet Cong.</p>
<p>The coming civil war will consist of the present administration , the DHS, the Chinese, the Russians, Polish troops, soldiers from Denmark, Germany and France as well as the Canadians, who are obligated by treaty to assist our government to put down and American insurrection, &amp;#160;versus the American military and the American people. This will be a United Nations action</p>
<p>Could a guerrilla war succeed? Is America equipped to fight a guerrilla war?</p>
<p>Military strategists identify four levels of conflict; (1) nuclear war is the trump&amp;#160;card&amp;#160;of all conflicts; 2) conventional warfare; (3) guerrilla warfare; and, (4) terrorism.</p>
<p>Terrorism is the least preferred option by any insurgent group. With terrorism, there is absolutely no hope of final victory because territory is never occupied. For that reason, nobody aspires to engage in terrorism if they have a viable alternative and the American people do have a choice given how well armed we are. However, terrorism arising out of a defeated guerrilla force is a distinct possibility as it would represent American guerrilla?s fall back position should they be defeated.</p>
<p>Please allow me to make one point perfectly clear, all of us, in these dire circumstances will be front line participants. Being a sheep will not ensure survival, it will only mean that you will die like a sheep. Most Americans will be targets of the occupation forces as the MIAC Report which labeled Libertarians, Constitutionalists, Second Amendment Supporters, Ron Paul Supporters, veterans and now Christians as domestic terrorists. Does it make a little more sense as to why DHS made these bold proclamations as to who is a &amp;#160;domestic terrorist?</p>
<p>DHS understands and has demonstrated their understanding of these facts and has also prepared for what I just wrote about in the previous paragraph.</p>
<p>Guerrilla warfare, for most of human history, is not new. Tribal war, which traditionally pits one guerrilla force against another, is the oldest form of warfare. The new ?conventional? form of warfare, which pits guerrillas against ?conventional? forces, is more recent as it arose in Mesopotamia 5,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The good news for future American freedom fighters is that guerrilla war has been getting more successful since 1945, but unfortunately guerrilla fighters still lose most of the time. An&amp;#160;analysis&amp;#160;of past conflicts featuring guerrilla war, reveals that only 25% of guerrilla forces, out of 443 such conflicts since 1775, were successful. The government prevailed almost 64% of the time with the remainder of the conflicts ended in a stalemate. Conversely, since the end of WWII, the percentage of success for guerrilla forces has indeed gone up to 39.6%. Yet that still means that government forces have continued to prevail 51% of the time.</p>
<p>When the American people engage in a guerrilla war in the upcoming years, the people have less than a 40% chance of success.</p>
<p>Guerrilla wars are rarely short and as a result do not favor the American culture and our collective psyche of instant gratification. When Americans flip the switch on the wall, we expect the light to come on. Will Americans set aside their entitlements as well as their entrenched soft lifestyle and rise to the occasion? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>This is a guest post by Cheryl Strauss Einhorn, a journalist and adjunct professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.</p>
<p>Last week, two ?firsts? occurred in Africa:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Were these the moves of a truly democratic leader, or are they the schemes of a crafty politician who stepped down so he could be tried as a private civilian in a court with the authority, but not the power, to collect evidence?</p>
<p>President Kenyatta knows that the ICC has no army or police to seize evidence. He is well aware that the prosecution is struggling to keep its case alive in the wake of two setbacks: witnesses recanting their testimony and a failure to secure Kenyatta?s phone and bank records that prosecutors claim would show he paid collaborators to take part in the post-election violence. Thus far seven witnesses for the prosecution have dropped out, allegedly through intimidation and bribes.</p>
<p>The prosecution has already asked once for the trial to be postponed. And judges are under pressure from other African leaders and the African Union to discontinue the case claiming that their heads of state should not be prosecuted by the ICC, which thus far has only brought indictments against African leaders, a state of affairs created by the ICC?s limited jurisdiction and authority.</p>
<p>Given the ICC?s difficulty, Kenyatta might expect the judges to feel compelled to drop the case. But perhaps the judges might consider postponing it indefinitely in an effort to delay justice so that it is not denied. Such a decision might have the collateral benefit of preserving the nascent ICC?s credibility as an impartial body.</p>
<p>Here?s how: A suspension would acknowledge that while there is no evidentiary cooperation now, the judges convey that it would be a mistake to dismiss the case entirely. It would allow the ICC to sidestep the growing diplomatic conflict with the African Union and effectively punt the future of the case to the ICC?s ruling body, the Assembly of States Parties, a political body that would be deciding the very political issue of when and how to try a case against a sitting leader.</p>
<p>While a deferral is at least a temporary win for Kenyatta, the ICC has already made a mark: The Kenyatta indictment sent a signal that the violence of 2007 would not again be tolerated and indeed it was not repeated after the last election. Moreover, leaders don?t often rule forever and thus witnesses may still come forward in the future, as they did after atrocities like the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Strong-men like Kenyatta can only continue to hoodwink their citizens with optics over evidence for so long. His grand gesture to step down to stand for a trial that can?t occur does not mean that he is innocent, but it may mean the ICC needs to be patient until Kenyatta?s time and options run out.</p>

<p><a href="/sub-saharan-africa/cameroon" type="external">Cameroon</a></p>
<p>Paul Biya, the president of Cameroon, announced on October 12 that <a href="http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/sunday/index.php/news/18400-cameroon-says-27-boko-haram-hostages-released" type="external">twenty-seven kidnap victims have been freed and turned over to the Cameroonian authorities</a>. The victims were kidnapped on May 16 and July 27. They included ten Chinese workers, the wife of Cameroon?s vice-prime minister, and the Lamido of Kolofata, a traditional Cameroonian ruler.</p>
<p>Boko Haram has not claimed responsibility for any of the kidnappings, though the media regularly assumes its responsibility for all high-profile kidnappings. But, criminal kidnapping gangs are active in Cameroon and Nigeria.</p>
<p>Cameroon claims that it never pays ransom. But, the <a href="http://www.peoplesdailyng.com/cameroon-denies-400000-ransom-to-boko-haram/" type="external">Nigerian press reports speculation that there had been a ransom demand of $400,000 for the wife of the vice-prime minister</a>. It also reports speculation in Cameroon?s capital of Yaounde that that the Biya government may have swapped the hostages for low-level Boko Haram fighters.</p>
<p>Boko Haram is usually careful to claim responsibility for its acts ? and not to claim responsibility for acts it has not committed. On that basis, I suspect that the kidnappings were carried out by criminal gangs rather than Boko Haram. If so, it is likely that Cameroon has paid a ransom to secure the release of the kidnapped victims. If, indeed, the kidnapping was carried out by Boko Haram, then the speculation that the victims were freed as part of a swap for Boko Haram fighters is also plausible.</p>
<p>In the world of West African kidnappings, victims are never released without a quid pro quo.</p>

<p>This is a guest post by Brooks Marmon, Accountability Architect at the <a href="http://www.accountabilitylab.org" type="external">Accountability Lab</a>.&amp;#160; Brooks was previously based in the Lab?s Liberia office and recently completely an extended assignment in Zimbabwe and South Africa.</p>
<p>West Africa may be at the center of the ongoing Ebola crisis, but the fear of the virus is pan-African. Much of the world sees Ebola as an African problem and Africans are beginning to internalize this perception as well. The continent?s response to the virus is seen domestically and internationally as a litmus test of the capacity and abilities of national governments which are using the crisis as a means to assure their citizens and international partners of their newfound capacities and crisis response potential.</p>
<p>In southern Africa, Zambia was one of the first countries to announce restrictions on travel from the Ebola affected countries in early August. Shortly thereafter, Kenya Airways halted flights to countries at the center of the Ebola epidemic.* South Africa, a major destination of travelers from West Africa, blocked visitors from the affected countries a few weeks later despite advice to the contrary from the World Health Organization. Namibia and Botswana followed suit soon after.</p>
<p>More recently, the continued spread of the virus has started to impact travel within Africa even outside of the Ebola hotspots. In late September, Namibia?s health minister advised Namibian nationals not to visit Zimbabwe due to Ebola fears. Zimbabwean officials in turn have encouraged their citizens to avoid all of West Africa, explicitly requesting that they cancel visits to popular Nigerian preachers.</p>
<p>Delving further into the Zimbabwe example, the Ebola crisis regularly makes headlines in the national press there. The country has adopted stringent Ebola prevention measures; including placing nearly one hundred travelers from West Africa under <a href="https://www.newsday.co.zw/2014/09/23/98-21-day-ebola-detention-harare/" type="external">close observation</a> for twenty-one days. Doctors and nurses have received Ebola training and a forty-bed Ebola treatment center <a href="http://ewn.co.za/2014/09/24/Zimbabwe-health-officials-ready-to-handle-Ebola-cases" type="external">has been established</a> in Harare. Ebola has severely disrupted customary cultural greetings in West Africa and Zimbabwe?s minister of health has similarly advised Zimbabweans to <a href="https://www.newsday.co.zw/2014/09/19/sick-pair-tests-negative-ebola/" type="external">avoid handshakes</a> and other intimate greetings. From HIV testing centers in the high-density township of Chitungwiza, to Africa University near the border with Mozambique, Ebola awareness posters are common across the country, indicating that both the state and its citizens take the disease very seriously.</p>
<p>Despite the precautionary measures, rumors of Ebola deaths at several Zimbabwean hospitals have gained traction. As a result of these fears, there have been <a href="https://www.newsday.co.zw/2014/08/26/ebola-outbreak-zimbabwe/" type="external">major cancellations</a> of reservations in resort towns like Victoria Falls and postponement of public events. Opponents of the governing party have used the disease as a political tool, leveraging that with Zimbabwe?s decaying health infrastructure and susceptibility to diseases like cholera, Ebola is positioned to devastate the country.</p>
<p>Following successful containment efforts in Nigeria and Senegal, Ebola now appears to be confined to the countries of the Mano River Basin. However, the inadequate conditions that allowed the disease to spread in those countries can be found across the continent. Citizens of countries like Zimbabwe, vividly remember similar failings of their governments to contain impending disasters, such as the initial voices of dissent from war veterans that culminated in the violent appropriation of farmland and hyperinflation. For much of the world, Africa is seen as a monolithic block, and Ebola perceptions will tarnish the whole continent, not only the countries where people are suffering from the virus.</p>
<p>Despite previous failings, authorities in Zimbabwe are demonstrating a significant commitment to ensure that the virus does not penetrate their borders. As the embarrassing <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-29483946" type="external">American response</a> to a case of Ebola in Texas shows, response to the unprecedented outbreak is not easy. While Ebola has sparked panic across Africa, its states are engaged in major efforts to limit the impact of the virus. Some countries are better equipped to respond to the crisis than others ? these efforts, combined with international assistance, are critical to ensure that the virus is defeated and that the destruction it causes, both physical and reputational, is minimal.</p>
<p>* There have been recent indications that many regional flights to the countries most severely impacted by the Ebola crisis in West Africa will soon resume.</p>

<p>On the night of April 14-15, 2014 up to three hundred girls from different schools in northeastern Nigeria gathered for their final examinations in the town of Chibok. Instead of taking their tests, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/16/world/africa/nigeria-dozens-of-girls-kidnapped.html?_r=0" type="external">they were kidnapped</a>. Three weeks later, on May 5, Boko Haram?s Abubakar Shekau claimed responsibility for the kidnapping. Some victims managed to escape, and the numbers still held in captivity are soft. The figure most often cited&amp;#160;by the media is 276.</p>
<p>Especially in the aftermath of Shekau?s video, with threats to sell the girls into slavery, there was international outrage. Even First Lady Michelle Obama publicly rallied around the hashtag <a href="" type="internal">#BringBackOurGirls</a>. The United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Israel, and other countries all offered assistance. There was widespread criticism of the lethargy of the Jonathan administration in taking concrete action.</p>
<p>Six months later, the school girls are still in captivity, and Chibok as an international issue has largely disappeared. World media attention is now on the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Ebola. But, not among some courageous Nigerians. The Guardian (London) <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/oct/13/nigeria-chibok-schoolgirl-abduction-kidnap-bringbackourgirls" type="external">on October 13 published an interview with Ibrahim Abdullahi</a>, a Nigerian lawyer who started the <a href="" type="internal">#</a>BringBackOurGirls campaign. Abdullahi renamed his Twitter campaign using a quotation from a statement made by the former Nigerian minister of education, Oby Ezekwesili, one of the few public figures to demand that the government move. Ezekwesili retweeted Abullahi?s re-named hashtag that then went ?viral.?</p>
<p>In his interview, Abdullahi provides details about the current state of the campaign. The campaigns current activities include:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet, sadly, Abdullahi notes in his interview that ?Even before Ebola and ISIS?s intensified activities, most of the world that stood with #BringBackOurGirls had moved on.? He calls for ?local and international media publicity and to march on the streets, as the #BringBackOurGirls campaign is here in Abuja.?</p>
<p>Kidnappings have been ubiquitous in Nigera, and not just associated with Boko Haram. It has probably accelerated since Chibok, though it is often difficult to determine whether the perpetrator is Boko Haram or criminal gangs.</p>

<p>Ebola is not showing the international community at its best. Even as Ebola panic seems to be spreading internationally, with possible new cases in Macedonia and the Czech Republic and Ebola deaths in Spain and the United States. Drew Hinshaw and Betsy McKay in the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/cuba-stands-at-forefront-of-ebola-battle-in-africa-1412904212" type="external">provide a run-down of which countries are doing what</a>. It is discouraging.</p>
<p>The United States is doing the most, having pledged four thousand troops and four hundred million dollars. It is also providing sixty-five U.S. Public Health service commissioned officers to staff an Ebola ward in Liberia. The WSJ also reports that more than 2,600 American health volunteers have signed up on a government website for possible deployment by NGO?s. However, the WSJ also reports that Congress has held up most of the Defense Department?s request for one billion dollars to combat Ebola, pending a strategy to protect the U.S. military from infection. The WSJ and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/10/world/africa/west-africans-make-plea-for-long-list-of-ebola-needs.html?ref=todayspaper&amp;amp;_r=0" type="external">New York Times (NYT)</a>&amp;#160;report instances in which Ebola is being used as a partisan political football in the run-up to the American mid-term elections in November.</p>
<p>At least the United States is doing something, though almost certainly not enough. China ? Africa?s biggest trading partner ? is providing one million dollars in cash along with two million dollars in food and specialists each to Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. In addition, China is sending 170 medical works to Liberia. There are at present fifty-eight Chinese at an Ebola treatment center, but thirty-five of those personnel are ?drivers , handymen and chefs.? So much for ?China in Africa.? India, another major African trading partner, has pledged $12.5 million, but no medical personnel. Brazil, a third major African trading partner, has contributed about $413,000. All South Africa has done is send a mobile lab to Sierra Leone. Japan is donating forty million dollars; Toyota is also donating automobiles. France, deeply involved politically in francophone Africa, is building a fifty-bed clinic in Guinea staffed by fifteen French medics. The UK is sending an additional 750 medical personnel to build clinics in Liberia and Sierra Leone. With respect to its size, Cuba has made by far the greatest effort, sending 165 medical personnel to West Africa.</p>
<p>All of this is a drop in the bucket. Via teleconference the heads of state of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone laid out their countries needs at the annual World Bank/International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington, DC, on October 9. According to the NYT, Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma said his country needs 1,500 more beds; 5,250 medical workers (750 doctors, 3,000 nurses, 1,500 support staff); 200 ambulances, 1,000 motorcycles, and 200 vehicles for burial teams.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the logistical problems mount. The NYT reports a Japanese official as saying that twenty thousand sets of protective gear sent from Japan are stuck in Abidijan, Cote d?Ivoire. The President of Guinea has appealed to the prime minister of Cote d?Ivoire.</p>
<p>Time would seem to be of the essence. The NYT reports that Doctors Without Borders (Medicins san Frontiers) reports a spike of new Ebola cases in Conakry and quotes a field coordinator as saying that there are new transmission chains ?whose origins we don?t know at the moment.?</p>

<p>First, a primer. The <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sc/" type="external">UN Security Council</a> consists of fifteen members. Five are permanent and have the power to veto all resolutions. These member states are China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In addition, there are ten non-permanent members that are elected for two-year terms by the UN membership in the General Assembly.</p>
<p>To be elected as a non-permanent member, a candidate country must receive a two-thirds vote in the General Assembly. Countries are divided into regional groups, and, by an agreement of some years standing, each group is assigned a specific number of non-permanent seats. The groups and the number of non-permanent Security Council seats they are assigned as follows: Africa, three; Asia-Pacific, two; Eastern Europe, one; Latin America and the Caribbean, two; and Western Europe and Others, two. If there are closely matched rivals for a regional non-permanent seat it is possible to have prolonged deadlock in the voting due to the two-thirds requirement. There have been cases of more than a hundred votes before a compromise was reached.</p>
<p>At present, the three African seats are held by Nigeria, Chad, and Rwanda. The terms of Nigeria and Chad expire in December 2015; Rwanda?s term expires in December 2014. <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201401270959.html" type="external">Angola is the only African country to have declared its candidacy</a> for the seat now held by Rwanda.</p>
<p>Angola?s candidacy is strong. It has served before as a non-permanent member, in 2003-2004. It enjoys the support of the South African Development Community and the Portuguese Speaking Countries Community. The Angolan government claims the endorsement of permanent members of the Security Council. Angola as a non-permanent Council member would provide linguistic balance in the Africa group: Nigeria is Anglophone, Chad is Francophone, and Angola is Lusophone: English, French, and Portuguese are the principle European languages spoken in Africa.</p>
<p>The Security Council is especially important to Africa. It is responsible for UN peacekeeping missions, <a href="http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/operations/current.shtml" type="external">more of which are located in Africa than on any other continent</a>. Support for reform of the Security Council is widespread in Africa. Nigeria and South Africa have campaigned for permanent seats on the Council, and each advances its candidacy for a permanent ?African? seat. Most Africans who follow the United Nations also advocate for the abolition of the veto power by permanent members. Other states urging for reform of the Security Council include Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan.</p>
<p>However, reform of the Security Council is a long way off. Reform would require the approval of all five of the permanent members, and that is not in the cards. Reform of the Council would, in effect, reduce the present power of the permanent members.</p>

<article id="0000430" published-at="2001-04-18" title="Mayne in narrow victory for Oakland council seat"><p>2001-04-18 04:00:00 PDT Oakland -- Voters in central East Oakland went to the polls yesterday to elect their City Council representative, the first time in Oakland that a mid-term vacancy was filled by a special election rather than appointment.</p>
<p>Candidate <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Moses+Mayne%22" type="external">Moses Mayne</a>, 51, a carpenters union official with big-name endorsements and the largest campaign chest, won by a narrow margin, according to the final unofficial tally.</p>
<p>"I would like to thank my challengers for running a good race and helping me to get elected," said Mayne, who was celebrating with about 90 people at his Eastmont Mall campaign headquarters. "They made me a little bit stronger in my enthusiasm and commitment, which helped me work harder, which helped me to win."</p>
<p>His closest challenger was BART director and community <a href="" type="internal">college</a> administrator <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Carole+Ward+Allen%22" type="external">Carole Ward Allen</a>, 58, who lost by 129 votes.</p>
<p>Mayne's other challengers were former school board member <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Toni+Cook%22" type="external">Toni Cook</a>, 57, who was running a distant third; and tax preparer and community activist <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Nancy+Sidebotham%22" type="external">Nancy Sidebotham</a>, 56, running fourth.</p>
<p>Both Sidebotham and Ward Allen had sought the seat before.</p>
<p>Mayne had long been considered the favorite to easily win the District 6 seat, garnering the support of Mayor <a href="" type="internal">Jerry Brown</a>, Council President <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Ignacio+De+La+Fuente%22" type="external">Ignacio De La Fuente</a> and state Sen. <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Don+Perata%22" type="external">Don Perata</a>, D-Oakland. He also was endorsed by <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Nate+Miley%22" type="external">Nate Miley</a>, who gave up the seat in January, halfway through his four-year term, after being elected to the <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Alameda+County+Board+of+Supervisors%22" type="external">Alameda County Board of Supervisors</a>.</p>
<p>Council vacancies previously had been filled by appointment of the council, but voters citywide approved a measure last November mandating mid-term special elections.</p>
<p>"It's a better way to go," said Ward Allen. "The people need to have input in whom we select, and the political machine, in my opinion, has to be broken."</p>
<p>Some council members had expressed concerns that the low turnout typical in special elections would mean the results would not be representative of residents' wishes. In hopes of increasing turnout to 20 percent, the city spent more than $12,000 on outreach including mailings and cable TV ads.</p>
<p>For the first time, a weeklong "early voting" period also was used, but only 419 of the nearly 26,500 registered voters in District 6 voted early.</p>
<p>Mayne outpaced his opponents in fund raising, with much of his support coming from labor. As of March 31, the last report due before the election, Mayne had raised nearly $38,000. In addition, the carpenters union spent $10, 000 on his behalf.</p>
<p>Ward Allen had raised about $21,000, Cook nearly $18,000 and Sidebotham $7, 600 -- $5,500 of it in loans from herself.</p>
<p>Yesterday's election also was the first in which matching public funds were available to candidates who agreed to a $90,000 spending cap and raised 5 percent of the ceiling, or $4,500, to qualify. The maximum each candidate could receive was $13,500. All but Sidebotham qualified.</p>
<p>Candidates could receive a dollar-for-dollar match for the first $100 of each contribution they received.</p>
<p>As of Monday, Ward Allen had received $12,707, Cook $6,193 and Mayne $3,900,</p>
<p>with a request pending.</p></article>
<article id="0000439" published-at="2014-06-30" title="Contraceptive-Mandate Defeat Gives Christian Colleges Hope For Exemption"><p>Slew of lower-court cases on hold pending Supreme Court?s ruling in Hobby Lobby</p>
<p>Backers of religious freedom for Christian universities cheered the Supreme Court?s ruling Monday that ?closely held for-profit corporations? like Hobby Lobby can claim a religious exemption from the Affordable Care Act?s so-called contraceptive mandate.</p>
<p>While the ruling does not guarantee a victory in the lower courts for universities challenging the mandate on religious grounds, religious freedom proponents are hopeful the courts will rule in favor of the universities.</p>
<p>Under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), the federal government can ?substantially burden a person?s exercise of religion? only when there is a ?compelling government interest? and it is the ?least restrictive means? of achieving the government?s purpose.</p>
<p>Writing for the 5-4 majority, Justice Samuel Alito <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf" type="external">wrote</a> that providing contraception can be in the government?s interest, but forcing businesses to provide it ?plainly fails? the least-restrictive-means test.</p>
<p>Injunctions Now, Vindication Soon?</p>
<p>Because the court ruled the federal government has other ways of providing contraception without requiring businesses to pay for them, religious universities may also qualify for that exemption.</p>
<p>Six of the schools represented by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty ? which also represented Hobby Lobby ? have been granted injunctions against the mandate, including Union University, Colorado Christian University and Houston Baptist University.</p>
<p>Colorado Christian was the most recent plaintiff to prevail. A federal judge in Denver <a href="" type="internal">issued an injunction</a> in late June, saying the mandate violated RFRA.</p>
<p><a href="" type="internal"></a>Many federal courts were waiting to rule on challenges to the mandate until after the Supreme Court ruled.&amp;#160; For example, the College of the Ozarks and Belmont Abbey College both have <a href="http://www.becketfund.org/hhsinformationcentral/#tab4" type="external">pending cases</a> in courts waiting to hear from the Supreme Court in the Hobby Lobby case.</p>
<p>Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, <a href="http://frcblog.com/2014/06/supreme-court-delivers-momentous-religious-freedom-victory/" type="external">said in a press release</a> he was meeting with the other plaintiff in the case, Mennonite-owned Conestoga Wood Specialties, when the Supreme Court ruling was announced.</p>
<p>?While we celebrate this landmark decision, it is our hope that lower courts will follow the Supreme Court?s lead and protect non-profits like Little Sisters of the Poor, Priests for Life, and Wheaton College? from the mandate, Perkins said.</p>
<p>Wheaton <a href="http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/FA-DC-0002-0006.pdf" type="external">lost its anti-mandate argument</a> in federal appeals court in 2012 on the grounds that the government had promised not to enforce the rule until it devised a final accommodation for religious schools like the evangelical Wheaton.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the College of the Ozarks told The College Fix the ruling would help it continue its Christian mission in education.</p>
<p>The Council for Christian Colleges and Universities released a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0t4gRxsJJL7QWxuWWlodm8xV1U/edit?usp=sharing" type="external">statement</a> asking the government to reconsider the regulations in light of the Supreme Court?s ruling and ?craft new regulations that fully respect the religious convictions of CCCU institutions.?</p>
<p>?Significant Game-Changer?</p>
<p>Jonathan Turley, a constitutional expert and law professor at Georgetown, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOB5GyT6qYo" type="external">told CNN</a> the ruling was a ?significant game-changer? and ?huge blow? to the administration.</p>
<p>?This has been an awful 10 days,? with the high court striking down federal programs relating to the Fourth Amendment and warrantless cellphone searches, separation of powers regarding federal appointments, and now the First Amendment religion clause, Turley said. ?You just don?t want to get out of bed after a week like that.&amp;#160;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The ruling left open some ambiguities to be sorted out in later court cases, such as what ?closely held? means.</p>
<p>Paul Horwitz, who teaches constitutional and religion law at the University of Alabama, told <a href="http://www.alabamas13.com/story/25907780/ua-professor-weighs-in-on-hobby-lobby-ruling" type="external">WVTM Birmingham</a> that since the ruling involves the RFRA statute and not the First Amendment directly, it may not help other entities get exemptions from parts of the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>?This case gave an answer for one dispute. But that?s all it could possible [sic] do and we can expect some form of this controversy to continue,? Horwitz said.</p>
<p>Brittney Cooper, a professor of women?s and gender studies at Rutgers University, disagreed with the ruling. ?No words, other than those of the four-letter variety, for the #scotus right now,? <a href="https://twitter.com/ProfessorCrunk/status/483631453842862080" type="external">she wrote on Twitter</a>.</p>

<article id="0000441" published-at="2012-12-21" title="A Show of Strength, Either Way it Goes"><p>If you go with the prevailing forecasts, <a href="" type="internal">Joe Straus</a>, R-San Antonio, is comfortably on his way to a third term as speaker of the Texas House, and the groups outside the Legislature that have been promoting his opposition ? Empower Texans and the Texas Eagle Forum, to name a couple of loud ones ? could be on their way to a significant write-down of their political power. It could be the moment when Toto pulls the curtain back to reveal the wizard as a regular guy using a small machine to make scary pictures and loud noises and lots of smoke.</p>
<p>In case you got lost in the shopping mall since last week?s installment, here?s the catchup report:</p>
<p>Rep. <a href="" type="internal">David Simpson</a>, R-Longview, is running for speaker.</p>
<p>Rep. <a href="" type="internal">Bryan Hughes</a>, R-Mineola, dropped his challenge (just a couple of days after telling a reporter he was ?in it to win it? after being asked if he was planning to bail). He?s supporting Simpson.</p>
<p>The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. <a href="" type="internal">Become one</a>.</p>
<p>And the speaker is unworried, saying he?s got the votes he needs. He?s also not showing them, which leaves him to take the heat but also gives his supporters cover while they calm local conservatives who?d like to see Straus demoted.</p>
<p>Some of what might have been the opposition is fragmented. Rep. <a href="" type="internal">Jodie Laubenberg</a>, R-Parker, who didn?t vote for Straus in 2011, told a group in her district this week that she?s on board with the speaker now.</p>
<p><a href="" type="internal">Phil King</a>, a conservative stalwart, was quoted in the Dallas Morning News questioning whether Simpson has the experience for the job and saying Straus appears to be in a very strong position for reelection. That's made him a target on AgendaWise, a conservative blog that previously held him in high regard.</p>
<p>The right is having a hard time finding something wrong with Straus that isn?t also a problem with people they support.&amp;#160;He got elected with Democratic support; so would a challenger unless a bunch of Republicans change their minds.&amp;#160;Straus helped balance the budget with accounting tricks. So did the governor and the lieutenant governor.</p>
<p>The speaker says he?s got the votes he needs, though fewer than three dozen members have put their names up for target practice. Simpson supporters say he?s ?gathering momentum? ? he has the public support of Hughes and himself.</p>
<p>The vote is on January 8.</p>

<article id="0000445" published-at="2016-02-06" title="Republican Ideological Purity Is A Failure For Most Americans"><p>If you actually think about why congress hasn?t been able to get anything done since 2010, look no further than the Tea Party. That was the year the Republican Party shifted its focus to ideological purity instead of actual governing. It gave them control of the House, and even flipped the senate red in 2012. But even after handing the reins of power over to the party promising a return to 19th century policies, nothing was achieved but government shutdowns, <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/3/gops-plan-to-shred-the-safety-net-in-2016.html" type="external">austerity, and gridlock.</a></p>
<p>With the rise of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, it seems that voters are catching on to the fact that ideological purity is fine if your chosen career is the priesthood. But for governing the richest nation on earth, it?s a crock.</p>
<p>Americans are angry, disappointed and disgusted with a bloated government that seems to be more concerned about stopping same sex couples from getting legally married, than they are about creating an economic environment that makes the middle-class thrive. That is probably because the <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/07/02/gop_austerity_is_a_disaster_of_greek_proportions_sam_brownback_bobby_jindal_the_economic_scam_of_the_century/" type="external">Republican solution to everything</a> appears to revolve around transferring wealth to billionaires via the tax code, and paying for it by forcing wages and benefits down by breaking unions, cutting programs that promote education, clean water, clean air, and anything that helps college students, seniors and disabled veterans.</p>
<p>And where does all this ?ideological purity? come from? Some suggest that it?s rooted in the Christian Bible. But I can?t for the life of me find any passage where Jesus said, ?Screw the poor and give everything to the rich?and while your at it, pollute the planet so much that is unable to sustain life.?</p>
<p>The real problem might be that most Americans don?t vote, and the minority that do aren?t smart enough to realize that single-issue voting on religious doctrine does nothing to improve the average American?s health, paycheck, or access to clean water and a planet that?s not cooking in climate changing <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/oct/05/the-republican-party-stands-alone-in-climate-denial" type="external">human-made air pollution.</a></p>
<p>While some American?s are not ready to admit that voting for the ?purest? candidate is a very bad idea, others are beginning to realize that an empty bank account and a polluted planet is a bad trade off for shutting down abortion clinics.</p>

<article id="0000452" published-at="2014-12-04" title="Asbestos Allegations Stir Controversy in Kilgore"><p>There is no doubt in Brian Nutt?s mind that the bullet that ripped through the front door of his home on the Monday before Thanksgiving had something to do with his position at Kilgore College.</p>
<p>?I don?t believe in randomness in this situation,? he said this week. ?I think it?s directly related to me being a trustee.?</p>
<p>Since he was elected to the college?s board last year, Nutt, the senior pastor of Grace Fellowship of Kilgore, has developed a reputation for aggressively questioning the status quo on issues, like how the college adheres to the state?s open meetings rules.</p>
<p>But tensions at the nearly 80-year-old community college reached new heights in mid-November when allegations surfaced&amp;#160;that the school was in the habit of improperly removing and disposing of asbestos from its buildings.</p>
<p>The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. <a href="" type="internal">Become one</a>.</p>
<p>The accusations came from inside the college. Dalton Smith, the school?s facilities director,&amp;#160;told <a href="http://www.news-journal.com/news/local/employee-kilgore-college-hid-asbestos-exposure-officials-deny-allegations/article_dbf1a180-1706-5460-815a-d57ce43f62a3.html" type="external">Bridget Ortigo of the Longview News-Journal</a> that the school had knowingly mishandled asbestos on multiple occasions. To back up his account, he produced&amp;#160;recordings that he said he secretly made of fellow employees discussing the matter.</p>
<p>Less than 24 hours after portions of those recordings ran on the News-Journal?s website, along with comments from Nutt encouraging an investigation into the matter, the trustee?s home was fired upon.&amp;#160;Police have not determined a motive for the shot fired through Nutt's front door.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Nutt continues to publicly question the actions of the college?s president, William Holda, and the majority of its board, whose members he says should be replaced.</p>
<p>?Here?s the dilemma I keep facing,? Nutt said. ?I don?t want the college hurt. I want the college to thrive and grow. But we have a very dysfunctional board in place that is closing their eyes to everything.?</p>
<p>Holda said there was a "true, true bidirectional lack of trust" between a majority of the board and Nutt, whom ? along with fellow trustee Carlos "Scooter" Griffin ? Holda described as "not always right but never in doubt."</p>
<p>According to Nutt, asbestos abatement is just the latest thing the board is not giving proper attention.</p>
<p>The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. <a href="" type="internal">Become one</a>.</p>
<p>Asbestos is a carcinogenic material that was commonly used in construction until its harmful health effects,&amp;#160;including&amp;#160;mesothelioma and asbestosis, became&amp;#160;widely known. It is typically only dangerous when friable, meaning&amp;#160;particles become&amp;#160;airborne.</p>
<p>According to state law, only properly licensed individuals, taking proper precautions, may remove asbestos from public buildings.&amp;#160;State health officials must have at least 10 days' notice must before any removal takes place. Violations carry steep fines.</p>
<p>In an interview this week, Smith said college officials, not wanting to deal with the additional time, money or both required to correctly remove the hazardous material, would have employees remove it and dispose of it.</p>
<p>The first time he said he became uncomfortable was earlier this year when asbestos was allegedly removed from the college?s auditorium shortly before it hosted the Rangerette Revels, the annual showcase of the school?s famous precision dance team.</p>
<p>?My biggest issue is that we didn?t test the air,? Smith said. ?We don?t know what was in the air for this major event, and the girls were right back in there on stage.?</p>
<p>He said he reached his breaking point following an alleged improper asbestos abatement at the hospital on campus.</p>
<p>?People are going there to get well,? said Smith, who battled leukemia as a child.</p>
<p>?I decided I don?t want to be a part of this anymore. If you can?t do it right, give me a shovel and I?ll dig ditches or bag groceries for minimum wage. I don?t care.?</p>
<p>The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. <a href="" type="internal">Become one</a>.</p>
<p>With his anxiety on the rise, Smith, who is still employed by the college, started recording his conversations. He later brought the situation to Nutt, who put him in touch with FBI officials.</p>
<p>Nutt, Griffin and Smith all say they have been in touch with federal investigators, but college administrators have said they are unaware of such an investigation.</p>
<p>In the course of being interviewed this week, to demonstrate the administration?s awareness of their actions, Smith played <a href="" type="internal">a segment of a secret recording</a> he made of a conversation he had with a man he identifies as&amp;#160;Dan Beach, the college?s director of special projects.</p>
<p>In it, the individual identified as Beach says Griffin, who like Nutt has earned a reputation as a provocateur on the board, is seeking to find a reason to fire him and Holda ? and he explains the angle Griffin is likely to take on the asbestos issue.</p>
<p>?What I?m guilty of,? he says to Smith in the recording, ?is forcing you ? to work in that room and all those people are exposed to it, and it?s my fault because I never cleaned it up, and now you guys are dying and I?m the one who killed you.?</p>
<p>Smith responds that he does not want to have to carry around an oxygen tank in his 60s just because he was doing his job.</p>
<p>Beach allegedly replies, ?I?m trying to figure out, how do I handle the problem sitting in front of my face right now? For me to fix this, to do it right, probably ain?t going to happen.?</p>
<p>Beach did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Holda said Smith?s recordings lack context and do not necessarily present the entirety of the conversations they contain. ?It?s very difficult to get your arms around the real context,? he said in an interview this week.</p>
<p>The Texas Department of State Health Services and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality have both opened investigations into the matter, Holda said.</p>
<p>?I am trying to stay out of their way and let them do their thing,? Holda said. ?My first area of focus is to make sure areas called into questions are indeed safe, and to do that with measurement and analysis.?</p>
<p>Before the story even hit the paper, Holda said, he contracted with ERI Consulting, an environmental consulting firm that specializes in asbestos, to measure the air quality in the auditorium, dorms, library and other facilities.</p>
<p>The final results are not all in yet, but Holda said the information received so far shows that the air is clear of asbestos.</p>
<p>Two potential trouble spots in the auditorium were identified, though, he said. Erring on the side of caution, a bathroom was locked, and some questionable floor tiles were covered over. Holda said he hopes to deal with those and any other short-term issues that arise as a result of ERI?s efforts over the winter break.</p>
<p>There are no plans to cancel or move the upcoming Rangerettes show being held in the auditorium.</p>
<p>?My second area of focus,? Holda said, ?is to find a way to properly investigate, without interfering with the two state agencies, the allegations that have been made and determine whether or not there is proof that any of these allegations are true.?</p>
<p>He said they had not received from Smith a list of alleged incidents of improper removal or disposal with details on who was involved and when they occurred.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Smith said the president has not attempted to contact him.</p>
<p>State Rep. <a href="" type="internal">David Simpson</a>, R-Longview, who represents the college, described Smith?s recordings as ?sobering.?</p>
<p>Simpson said he is monitoring the situation, but does not yet believe a legislative response is necessary.</p>
<p>?I think what we need is sunlight,? Simpson said. ?It?s the best disinfectant. If there has been wrongdoing, we need to identify it, repudiate it and move forward.?</p></article>
<article id="0000457" published-at="2007-10-26" title="Tell BioD what car to buy"><p>My beater has passed 170,000 miles. I couldn?t get the key to turn the other day, and the steering column wouldn?t lock.</p>
<p>Rather than spend a day ripping my car apart, I had it towed to a dealership where I was told it would cost $900 to repair. A spring had broken and the column lock pin had fallen into the key mechanism. I told the mechanic to throw the pin and spring away because I don?t care if the column locks, I just don?t want it to lock while I?m driving down the freeway. I?m going to hotwire the switch, which means I also won?t need an ignition key. So, for now I can continue to drive it, but only until I find a replacement.</p>
<p>We are a two-car family. My wife drives a Prius and I am driving an ?89 Cherokee. I haul heavy stuff in it fairly often and use it to visit my forest property on logging roads once in a blue moon. Otherwise, it sits idle most of the time, thanks to my hybrid electric bike and working out of my home.</p>
<p>I?m thinking <a href="http://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/Detailsresult.do?vehicle_ID=43830" type="external">Yaris hatchback</a> with a trailer hitch and a roof rack. I should still be able to haul stuff around the city now and then using my fold up trailer, and put other things in a cargo carrier for longer trips. I can rent a truck when I need to haul big stuff.</p>
<p>I?ll tell you what else I like about a Yaris. It has electric steering. I have a pipe dream of modifying one with A123 batteries and an electric motor to drive the back wheels. Most cars need the engine running to drive pumps, which drive their power steering and brakes. With electric steering, I can turn the motor off and run the power steering on batteries. My wife and kids want me to get something bigger because we have always relied on the Jeep to haul the big stuff around. I don?t know. I think we could live without it ? but a Yaris might be a mistake. What should I do?</p></article>

<p></p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The stilettos didn?t exactly come off as empathetic, but while interviewing Donald Trump on Friday, Mike Huckabee praised her for her ?empathy? and said she was one of Trump?s ?greatest assets.?</p>
<p>Trump agreed, and then defended the First Lady, claiming Melania, ?out of respect for the White House, wants to look good? and ?puts on formal shoes, high heels? even when going to a disaster zone. When it comes to the now infamous pair of heals, Trump said that she had sneakers with her to change into.</p>
<p>She did eventually wear a pair of Adidas? Stan Smiths, and changed her silk bomber jacket for a white zip-up, and a hat that said ?FLOTUS,? which the Daily Show?s Trevor Noah mocked by saying ?In Melania?s defense, she lives in a permanent disaster zone, and that?s what she always wears.?</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Noah also pointed out another problem. ?People weren?t talking about the nuclear missile that Kim Jong-un tested, because Melania Trump apparently did something much worse. She went to Houston wearing high heels,? said Noah, before adding, ?Here?s the thing, I don?t know why anyone should care what anyone wears when they?re on their way to help people. Who cares??</p>
<p>Considering no one has mentioned this since she did that until now, it looks like Trump cares. ?She took tremendous abuse,? he said to Huckabee. ?But the good news is, the people understand it.?</p>
<p>North Korea threatened the United States several times since Hurricane Harvey hit, and Trump is still hung up on how people didn?t like his wife?s shoes.</p>

<article id="0000490" published-at="2017-01-13" title="California?s Self-Inflicted Educational Crisis"><p>Even today few people really understand how special interest lobbyists craft education legislation in ways that enrich private business without necessarily doing anything for students. High-interest student loans and expensive test fees for teacher certifications didn?t just fall fully formed out of the sky. They were in many cases clothed in the noblest of intentions but at heart designed to make certain people rich.</p>
<p>We need only look to California to see an example of this process at work: The state is currently facing a severe teacher shortage?the result of its blinkered teacher credentialing policies?that will affect hundreds of thousands of public school students. The story of how it arrived here should serve as a warning to other states about how to avoid policies that serve special interests while doing nothing for, or even harming, educational outcomes.</p>
<p>The best way to begin this story is by posing a basic question: How did teacher credential programs in California become so expensive and bureaucratic?</p>
<p>In 1998, California state senator Deirdre ?Dede? Alpert and Assembly Member Kerry Mazzoni introduced SB 2042, passed by the California legislature and signed into law that same year. Teacher preparation requirements had not been updated since the Ryan Act of 1970; SB 2042 was supposed to establish new teacher preparation program requirements. The California Commission on Teacher Credentialing was given the authority to establish new teacher education curriculum and program standards.</p>
<p>SB 2042 was subsequently revised under the influence of the Bush Administration?s No Child Left Behind&amp;#160;(NCLB) legislation. The law burdened many states and public school districts with Federal mandates on penalty of losing Federal funding. Indeed, SB 2042 was revised before it was fully implemented, and as it faced headwinds from NCLB?s&amp;#160;intense focus on teacher and student accountability. The initial intent of SB 2042 was to streamline the credentialing process, but instead SB 2042 ended up making individuals jump through even more bureaucratic hoops. Students in the California Teacher Credential Programs contend that certain classes are unnecessary and repetitive.</p>
<p>Student teachers also have to pass tedious Teacher Performance Assessments (TPAs) and must pay hefty fees to the private companies that administer these tests for the dubious privilege. They also must pay for and pass the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST) and the California Subject Examinations for Teachers (CSET) tests. The Multiple Subject and Single Subject Preliminary Credential Program Standards is now a two- to three-year teacher credential program that can be quite expensive. With all the requirements, many student teachers fall into debt, with some owing as much as $50,000.</p>
<p>These teacher preparation programs are too long, bureaucratic, expensive, and unaccommodating for older, working adults who have been in the labor force for decades and have full-time jobs to juggle while enrolled in the teacher credentialing program. It is easier for younger students already enrolled in a university to obtain a teaching credential, but they are liable to meet the same fate that every aspirant faces: colliding with the union-supported seniority system in place in most public school districts.</p>
<p>A highly experienced, motivated, and knowledgeable individual in his or her thirties or forties who manages to get through the credentialing barriers to entry will then face the disheartening fact that there are no job openings for a grade level or subject that she or he is expert in. Many end up quitting the teacher credential program and moving into substitute teaching. Those who make it through will often be sent to some of the toughest schools, where new teachers are often treated like migrant workers. They work intensely with minimal pay as administrators micromanage their every move in the classroom. No wonder so many burn out within the first or second year of teaching, even after having gone $30,000 to $50,000 in debt.</p>
<p>And that is why California now faces an acute teacher shortage: The public education special interests and for-profit credentialing industry got greedy and overplayed their hands. In their zeal to limit competition, they have created as massive public policy crisis.</p>
<p>Have teacher or student performance improved due to SB 2042? Not necessarily. Have state bureaucratic requirements increased for the purpose of rewarding politicians, empowering bureaucrats, and enriching testers and banks? Yes. By raising barriers to entry in teaching, has the implementation of SB 2042 harmed the children of the state of California? Yes, indeed.</p>
<p>SB 2042 needs urgent revision, and the current crisis should help get that done. It should not take more than two years to get a teaching credential. It should be a one-year (academic) program heavy on concepts and theory that leads to a one-year paid internship at a school that embraces and supports student teachers. Teachers do not really learn to teach in an education program; they learn to teach from mentors in an actual classroom.</p>
<p>The system should also not take advantage of free labor, as it does now, by requiring three months of full-time unpaid teaching by student teachers. How is someone supposed to pay rent or a mortgage if required to work for free for three months? Clearly, a revised SB 2042 should not punish professionals who want to switch careers and become public school teachers, as it does now.</p>
<p>Fixing California?s teacher credentialing requirements is not rocket science. There is no intellectual problem here; there is only a political problem. The legislature is in thrall to politicians doing the bidding of banks and testing contractors. No one seems to speak for the children. So maybe it?s time for parents to throw a temper tantrum on their behalf.</p></article>
<article id="0000495" published-at="2015-10-16" title="CNBC Agrees to Trump's Debate Demands">CNBC has given in to Donald Trump's demands and will limit its Oct. 28 Republican primary debate to two hours. Trump tweeted the news early Friday:
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/15/politics/trump-carson-cnbc-republican-debate-threaten-pullout/" type="external">CNN</a>, citing a source with knowledge of the decision,&amp;#160; confirmed Trump's announcement, reporting that the Republican National Committee was contacting campaigns with the news Friday morning. Trump and candidate Ben Carson, the two leading Republican presidential contenders, on Thursday had threatened to pull out of the third GOP debate in Coloradoin a dispute with CNBC and the RNC over the length of the debate and other rules. Trump took to Twitter after a conference call Thursday afternoon between RNC officials and top advisers to the candidates erupted into chaos over the issues,
<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/donald-trump-threatens-to-pull-out-next-gop-debate-214837" type="external">Politico reports.</a> Both Trump and Carson were particularly concerned about the debate's length and whether candidates would be allowed to make opening and closing statements. The New York real estate magnate posted these tweets: Trump later Thursday did not rule out appearing, even if the debate did extend beyond two hours. "I don't care. I can stand for five hours," he told
<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/on-the-record/index.html" type="external">Greta Van Susteren</a> on Fox News. "I can stand for 10 hours. But it's unfair to the viewers. It's too long. "They have sold out all their commercials and want to increase it by an hour," Trump said of CNBC. "Now, they want to make this an extra hour. "I think it's unfair to the viewers because it's too much. It's too much to watch ? and they are doing it because they want to make more money." The Carson camp fired off a letter to CNBC Washington Bureau Chief Matthew Cuddy on behalf of both campaigns earlier Thursday. The third debate will be held on Oct. 28 at the University of Colorado-Boulder.&amp;#160; "Mr. Trump and Dr. Carson do agree to a 120 minute debate that includes commercial breaks and opening and closing statements," the campaign said in the letter, a copy of which was provided to Newsmax. "Mr. Trump and Dr. Carson do not, and will not, agree to appear at a debate that is more than 120 minutes long including commercials breaks. "Further, the debate must include opening and closing statements from all the candidates," the letter said. The Carson letter stated that CNBC outlined a two-hour debate format, plus commercials, and without the statements. The objective was "reiterated" in a conference call Wednesday with the campaign staffs. "To be clear, neither of our campaigns agreed to either the length you propose or your ban on opening or closing statements," the document said. "In fact, neither of our campaigns were even consulted. "Neither of those conditions are acceptable," the letter continued. "Neither Mr. Trump or Dr. Carson will participate in your debate if it is longer than 120 minutes including commercials and does not include opening and closing statements." Hope Hicks, a Trump spokeswoman, did not respond to a Newsmax query seeking comment. "The criteria that was outlined by CNBC was never discussed with any of the candidates or the campaigns," Corey Lewandowski, Trump's campaign manager, told
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/10/15/donald-trump-campaign-raises-specter-of-boycotting-next-debate/?_r=0" type="external">The New York Times.</a> "So what CNBC did was send out a memo and said, 'Here's the criteria as you have approved them' and that went out to all the campaigns. "We said we never agreed to this criteria," Lewandowski said. Brian Steel, a CNBC spokesman,
<a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/257046-trump-threatens-to-skip-next-gop-debate" type="external">told The Hill</a> that the network typically eschewed opening statements "to allow more time to address the critical issues that matter most." "We started a dialogue yesterday with all of the campaigns involved and we will certainly take the candidates' views on the format into consideration as we finalize the debate structure," Steel said in a statement. In the Thursday conference call reported by Politico, Lewandowski said that if the debate moved beyond two hours, even with commercials, and excluded the statements, Trump might not participate. Three sources spoke to Politico about the 29-minute conference call, which was hastily arranged by RNC officials after the campaigns complained the previous day. The call was led by two top RNC officials, Katie Walsh and Sean Spicer. They began by telling the campaigns that RNC Chairman Reince Priebus had discussed the statements' issue with CNBC ? and that he wanted to learn what each candidate's "red line" was on the terms, Politico reports. Jason Miller, a strategist for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, said that the campaign would consider not participating if opening and closing statements were not allowed. Chris LaCivita, an aide to Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, then said, "If we don't have opening and closing statements, CNBC can go f--- themselves," Politico reports. Lewandowski spoke again, followed by Beth Hansen, campaign manager for Ohio Gov. John Kasich. She called the conference call a "debacle," according to the report. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, representing former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, said that she was concerned that not all candidates would have equal time during the debate. But Terry Sullivan, campaign manager for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, said that the candidate would be at the debate ? "hell or high water" ? and that he agreed that all participants should be allowed to make the statements, Politico reports. Peter Flaherty, an adviser to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, voiced similar concerns. Meanwhile, the manager for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's campaign, Ken McKay, said that he was concerned about stating his position on an open conference call, according to the report. Walsh, the RNC's chief of staff, then tried to end the call. But Christian Ferry, a top adviser to South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, asked whether any candidates at the lower end of the polling would be allowed in if others pulled out. Graham has been relegated to the lower-tier debates. But former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina attacked Trump and Carson, saying that she wanted a longer debate. She moved up to the main debate after a strong appearance in the first "happy hour" debate. "Apparently, they're worried about answering questions for three hours," Fiorina told
<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/shows/the-kelly-file.html" type="external">Megyn Kelly</a> on Fox News. "We have 10 candidates on the stage. I don't think three hours is a long time.&amp;#160; "I think the American people really like them," she added. "And we ought to stand and answer as many questions as we can." Fiorina contrasted Trump and Carson's "outsider" status with their demands for the opening and closing remarks. "Prepared statements are what politicians do," she told Kelly. "You're two outsiders. "Honestly, they sound a lot like politicians tonight to me." Former New York Gov. George Pataki, also an undercard participant, used Twitter to slam the GOP front-runners:</article>
<article id="0000498" published-at="1999-05-26" title="Clinton Tries To Downplay Spying Report / President defends China ties as furor grows over charges"><p>Caption</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>1999-05-26 04:00:00 PDT Washington -- President Clinton said yesterday that a congressional report detailing a vast Chinese spying network should not be used as an excuse to sever ties with the world's most populous nation, declaring that a close bond with China is in America's interest.</p>
<p>Clinton said his administration is "moving aggressively to tighten security" at the nation's weapons laboratories and noted that China has agreed to limit testing and exportation of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>"I strongly believe that our continuing engagement with China has produced benefits for our national security," Clinton said during an appearance in Texas.</p>
<p>The comments came in response to the official release of the long- awaited congressional report, which concludes that China has been stealing U.S. nuclear secrets for the past two decades as part of an espionage program that "almost certainly" continues even today.</p>
<p>"Thefts of nuclear secrets from our national weapons laboratories enabled the (People's Republic of China) to design, develop and successfully test modern strategic nuclear weapons sooner than would otherwise have been possible," said the three-volume, 900-page report. "The stolen U.S. nuclear secrets give the PRC design information on thermonuclear weapons on a par with our own."</p>
<p>The report chronicles a wide range of activities, including Chinese front companies and "liaison groups" that do business with U.S. firms in hopes of stealing technology. The report charges that the primary group, the <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22China+Association+for+International+Exchange+of+Personnel%22" type="external">China Association for International Exchange of Personnel</a>, used its seven offices, including one in San Francisco, to establish contact with Western scientists and researchers.</p>
<p>China is also accused of resorting to more traditional cloak-and-dagger techniques, like ransacking hotel rooms of visiting scientists and "subjecting the visitor to a grueling itinerary and providing copious alcoholic beverages so as to wear the visitor down and lower resistance to questions."</p>
<p>"The People's Republic of China has stolen classified information on every currently deployed warhead in the U.S. ballistic missile arsenal," said Representative <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Christopher+Cox%22" type="external">Christopher Cox</a>, R- <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Newport+Beach%22" type="external">Newport Beach</a>, chairman of the panel that issued the report.</p>
<p>While the report alleges that China engaged in an intense effort to obtain America's most valued nuclear secrets, it also excoriates the U.S. intelligence community for failing to protect them. In identifying the nation's nuclear weapons laboratories -- including the <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Lawrence+Livermore+Laboratory%22" type="external">Lawrence Livermore Laboratory</a> in the East Bay -- as primary targets of Chinese espionage efforts, the report said attempts to curb such spying "fail to meet even minimal standards."</p>
<p>Representative <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Norm+Dicks%22" type="external">Norm Dicks</a> of Washington, the committee's ranking Democrat, characterized China's penetration of U.S. weapons laboratories as a "a major counterintelligence failure . . . one of the worst failures in the nation's history."</p>
<p>The report makes 38 recommendations, ranging from new limitations on the export of technology to heightened counterintelligence at the national laboratories.</p>
<p>Energy Secretary <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Bill+Richardson%22" type="external">Bill Richardson</a>, whose department oversees the labs, said that nearly all of the recommendations had already been adopted.</p>
<p>"We are fixing the problem," Richardson said. "I can assure the American people that their nuclear secrets are now safe at the labs."</p>
<p>Polygraph tests and security reviews for those with access to sensitive information are among the reforms that are already being instituted, and Congress has expressed its desire for tighter security by increasing the budget for counterintelligence from $2.6 million in 1996 to $39.2 million in 2000.</p>
<p>The controversy has led to questions over whether the <a href="" type="internal">University</a> of California -- which manages the Livermore and Los Alamos nuclear weapons labs for the <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Department+of+Energy%22" type="external">Department of Energy</a> -- might lose its 56-year-old association with the facilities.</p>
<p>Although Richardson said he might consider putting management of the labs up for competitive bidding, he indicated the security breaches would not cost UC the contract.</p>
<p>"The <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22University+of+California%22" type="external">University of California</a> has been a valued partner with our labs," Richardson said. "But again, under my administration, everything is up for grabs."</p>
<p><a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Representative+Ellen+Tauscher%22" type="external">Representative Ellen Tauscher</a>, D-Walnut Creek, whose district includes Livermore, said it was inappropriate to blame UC, which is not in charge of security, for the lapses.</p>
<p>"If <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Jesse+James%22" type="external">Jesse James</a> knocks off five Federal Reserve Banks, you don't take ( <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Federal+Reserve+Board+President%22" type="external">Federal Reserve Board President</a>) <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Alan+Greenspan%22" type="external">Alan Greenspan</a> to the woodshed.

"There's not been any questions about the day-to-day management of the labs."</p>
<p>Tauscher also warned against extra scrutiny of -- or outright discrimination against -- the hundreds of Chinese American laboratory scientists, some of whom have complained recently of "ethnic profiling" in light of recent developments.</p>
<p>"What we don't want is for these hard-working Americans to be viewed differently today than they were yesterday," Tauscher said.</p>
<p>The <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Cox+committee%22" type="external">Cox committee</a> -- officially known as the <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Select+Committee%22" type="external">Select Committee</a> on <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22U.S.+National+Security%22" type="external">U.S. National Security</a> and Milita- ry/Commercial Concerns with the People's Republic of China -- was formed last year by then-House Speaker <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Newt+Gingrich%22" type="external">Newt Gingrich</a>. It completed a "top secret" report in January, then spent months haggling with the Clinton administration over what parts could be included in a declassified report.</p>
<p>The findings were made public at a particularly tense time in U.S.-China relations, just weeks after NATO bombs hit the <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Chinese+Embassy%22" type="external">Chinese Embassy</a> in Belgrade as part of the air campaign in Yugoslavia. The timing prompted officials in Beijing to label the report an attempt to divert the public's attention and dismissed its contents as a fabrication.</p>
<p>The tenor of the committee -- made up of five Republicans and four <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Democrats%22" type="external">Democrats</a> -- was unusually congenial, lacking the partisan overtones that have characterized recent congressional efforts.</p>
<p>"Our committee did not engage in surmising; we did not engage in opinion," said Cox, who has been widely praised for his evenhanded approach. "We reported only facts, and that is why we could agree with one another."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, other Republicans were quick to use the findings to criticize the White House.</p>
<p><a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22House+Majority+Whip+Tom+DeLay%22" type="external">House Majority Whip Tom DeLay</a>, R-Texas, called the Clinton administration's response to early reports of espionage "pathetic" and raised the possibility that the administration had not responded more aggressively because it wanted to protect campaign contributions and business opportunities for big contributors.</p>
<p>"We are forced to question whether the president and the vice president deliberately ignored the reality of Chinese spying and theft because they had ulterior economic and political motives," DeLay said.</p>
<p>DeLay said that although it "wasn't too diplomatic," he recently told the Chinese ambassador to the United States, "Don't mistake the weakness of this president for the weakness of the American people."</p>
<p>Clinton, however, was strongly defended by many Democrats, including Representative <a href="" type="internal">Nancy Pelosi</a>, D-San Francisco, a member of the House Intelligence Committee who has been a consistent critic of the president's policy of "constructive engagement" with China.</p>
<p>Pelosi noted that concerns over espionage at the labs were also raised during the Reagan and Bush administrations, neither of which took any action.</p>
<p>"While I have many serious disagreements with the Clinton administration's China policy, it is important to recognize that this administration has acted on its own to take steps to solve the security problems at the national labs."</p>
<p>Many details in the report were removed at the request of the Clinton administration, which said their inclusion would compromise sources or current investigations.</p>
<p>The report is likely to be the basis of upcoming hearings and legislation. Nine congressional committees are currently looking into the espionage charges.</p></article>
<article id="0000505" published-at="2017-05-18" title="President Trump is erupting over the Russia probe?s new special counsel"><p>The big question after the Justice Department announced that a special counsel would investigate Russian interference into the 2016 election was how President Donald Trump would react.</p>
<p>The initial signs could have been worse. <a href="" type="internal">Trump issued a statement</a> that didn?t directly challenge the legitimacy of Robert Mueller, the former FBI director appointed to conduct the investigation. White House aides <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/17/donald-trump-special-prosecutor-mueller-238534" type="external">told</a> Politico that Trump?s reaction was ?extremely measured? and that he ?didn't yell or scream? at the room in front of him.</p>
<p>But the presidential eruption came anyway ? less than 12 hours later, in fact. Early Thursday morning, Trump lashed out against the investigation on Twitter, calling it the ?single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!?</p>
<p>Of course, this is not true. Trump is very clearly not the target of the ?single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history,? an honor that probably belongs to George Burroughs of Salem.</p>
<p>But the president has been increasingly demanding recognition as a victim. At a commencement address on Wednesday, he said that ?no politician in history ... has been treated more unfairly,? which <a href="" type="internal">is pretty flatly false</a>.</p>
<p>All of it suggests that Trump is treating news of the probe into his campaign?s ties with Russia very poorly. Even his statement reacting to the special counsel, which won praise for being subdued, marked a sharp break from the tones of presidents past. ( <a href="" type="internal">Previous presidents have welcomed the investigation and vowed the White House?s cooperation</a>; Trump did neither.)</p>
<p>Democrats and left-wing activists celebrated the special counsel appointment Wednesday night, arguing that it was a welcome step toward getting to the bottom of the probe.</p>
<p>But that?s only true if Trump lets it. The president still has the authority to fire the deputy attorney general and replace him with someone who has orders to end the special counsel probe. There?s no sign yet that he?d have the brazenness to do so. But given how outraged the president appeared Thursday morning, the possibility doesn?t seem totally off the table, either.</p></article>
<article id="0000509" published-at="2017-09-25" title="NFL Kneelers are in Violation of Multiple Federal Laws and it has Nothing to do with the 1st Amendment"><p></p>
<p>There is something not being mentioned about these NFL ?protests,? which on their face are clearly seditious and subversive behavior. There are a lot of Americans who are claiming that these players have every right to protest and they are just expressing their 1st amendment rights. I would like to challenge those Americans to an informational duel! The 1st amendment does NOT say that you can lie to the American public for political gain! It states that CONGRESS SHALL MAKE NO LAW ?abridging of free speech.? Congress has NOT made a law abridging their free speech, so the 1st amendment has no application in this at all, especially when you consider the laws they are violating with their so-called ?freedom of speech!?</p>
<p>Any American?s ?freedom of speech? goes out the window when you begin violating the law with that speech. Take into consideration that these athletes are clearly acting in a seditious manner and subverting the US Government, specifically the President of the United States! Donald Trump is no longer just some man in America, he is the PRESIDENT! Yesterday?s mass-protests were not because of some social injustice, which is being entirely fabricated by the way, it was because President Trump told the American people that these players should be taken off of the field for their phony protests.</p>
<p>Take a second and think about what these sports figures are doing. They are pushing a narrative that is provably FALSE! They are kneeling (they say) because of the ?oppression? of black people in America, and because of ?police violence? against black people in America. The problem is that when you examine the statistics, you will find their narrative is ENTIRELY FALSE! That is why NOTHING is being done about it?because it simply is NOT true!</p>
<p>Watch the following video that points out the actual statistics, which were compiled in legitimate studies by Harvard University, the ACLU, among other leftist organizations. These studies prove beyond any shadow of a doubt that police are in fact NOT targeting innocent black people, quote the opposite is true.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>What these athletes are REALLY doing is being used as political pawns in a subversive game in which the leftists in America are attempting to oust the President for no legitimate reason. Yesterday?s protests had NOTHING to do with ?oppression? or ?police violence,? rather they were orchestrated purposefully to subvert the President, and to disrespect out nation?s Flag and National Anthem. This was, and will continue to be, a clear violation of a few laws?NOT an expression of 1st amendment rights. Take a look at the 1st amendment and the laws for yourself, and judge for yourself?</p>
<p>Amendment 1 to the Constitution: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.</p>
<p>4 U.S. Code ? 8 ? Respect for flag: No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America; the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing. Regimental colors, State flags, and organization or institutional flags are to be dipped as a mark of honor.</p>
<p>18 U.S. Code ? 2383: Rebellion or insurrection: Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof, or gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States. 18 U.S. Code ? 2387 ? Activities affecting armed forces generally:</p>
<p>(a) Whoever, with intent to interfere with, impair, or influence the loyalty, morale, or discipline of the military or naval forces of the United States:</p>
<p>(1) advises, counsels, urges, or in any manner causes or attempts to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty by any member of the military or naval forces of the United States; or</p>
<p>(2) distributes or attempts to distribute any written or printed matter which advises, counsels, or urges insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty by any member of the military or naval forces of the United States?</p>
<p>Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both, and shall be ineligible for employment by the United States or any department or agency thereof, for the five years next following his conviction.</p>
<p>According to the 1st Amendment, if you have grievances it is your duty to petition the government to make a change. These athletes are not petitioning the government at all; rather they are pushing weaponized propaganda on the unsuspecting American public. Aforementioned, your ?freedom of speech? disappears when you start to advocate for the putting down of our government and the country in general. In fact, it is a clear violation of federal law. These players may as well be burning the flag of the country that allows them to be successful athletes. They are directly putting down the military lives which have been sacrificed to protect their freedom and their ability to play a game for a living.</p>
<p>Beyond just the law violations, it should also be mentioned that they are holding up racist symbols of hate on the football field, and they are pushing leftist propaganda. WAKE UP AMERICA! Every one of these players that stayed in the locker room, and their coaches who authorized and even took part in the protests in some cases, should be arrested for the violation of these aforementioned laws. I don?t say this because I disagree with the protests; I say it because if it was ME who did this?I would be arrested for sure. If there is ANY social injustice in our country, it is the fact that these leftists persecute anyone who doesn?t agree with them, yet they are allowed to act in a seditious manner and openly subvert the will of the American people with impunity. Where are the protests for THAT?!</p>
<p>This has gotten entirely out of hand, and Americans are sick to death of it. I say again, these were protests against President Donald Trump, NOT some legitimate social injustice. These athletes, along with their seditious leftist string-pullers, are clearly subverting the will of the American people and a duly elected President. They are in violation of multiple laws, and for once the law should start to be applied to these radical left organizations and anyone pushing their fake-lying narratives.</p>

<article id="0000510" published-at="2016-07-11" title="One chart that shows why today's low interest rates could be permanent"><p>The interest rate the US government pays to borrow money for 10 years fell below 1.4 percent last week. Those are the lowest borrowing costs Washington has faced ? ever. This <a href="http://qz.com/725992/us-bond-yields-have-never-been-this-low-and-we-looked-at-data-going-back-to-1786/" type="external">chart from Quartz</a> tells the story:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The falling interest rates of the past decade have surprised a lot of people. When I bought a house a year ago, people told me I should hurry up and close a deal before interest rates rose again. (Mortgage rates and government bond rates are different, but they tend to move up and down together.) Instead, mortgage rates have fallen further.</p>
<p>For almost a decade, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2007/05/24/real_estate/mortgage_rates/index.htm?postversion=2007052417" type="external">people have been predicting</a> that rates would rise soon ? even as they kept falling and falling. Many people still assume it?s only a matter of time before rates start drifting back up toward "normal" rates of 6 to 8 percent (for mortgages) and 4 to 6 percent (for government bonds).</p>
<p>But looking at interest rates over a longer time period suggests a different possibility: Today?s interest rates are normal.</p>
<p>Suppose you showed someone a chart of government 10-year borrowing costs from 1800 to 1960 and asked them to project rates in the 2010s. They would probably observe the fairly steady downward trend and predict that rates in the 2010s would be very low ? perhaps around 1.5 percent, where they stand today.</p>
<p>The reason people have such a strong intuition that 6 percent interest rates are normal and 1.5 percent interest rates are abnormal is that the human life span is only about 80 years. Few people alive today remember the ultra-low interest rates of the 1940s, and no one today remembers the steadily declining interest rates of the 1800s. But lots of people remember that interest rates were a lot higher than the 1970s, '80s, or '90s, and they?re expecting those high rates to come back.</p>
<p>But there?s good reason to think that the period from 1960 to 2010 was an anomaly driven by the high inflation rates of the period. Bond markets in the 1970s worried that inflation would erode the value of their investments, so they demanded higher interest rates to compensate. But when inflation rates started to fall in the 1980s, interest rates fell too.</p>
<p>And if you think about the big picture, falling interest rates make perfect sense. Like any price, interest rates are driven by supply and demand. And America is getting richer and richer, driving up the supply of capital. So of course the price of capital is going to fall.</p></article>

<article id="0000519" published-at="2010-08-15" title="Codex Alimentarius Are American consumers at risk of losing their right to purchase and use vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements?"><p>Claim: &amp;#160; The ?Codex Alimentarius? will eliminate U.S. consumers? rights to purchase and use vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Examples: &amp;#160; [Collected via e-mail, 2005]</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The CODEX ALIMENTARIUS (Food Code) is setting the supplement standards for all countries in the WTO. They will be enforced by the WTO and will over ride U.S. laws. The U.S. President and Congress agreed to this take-over when the WTO Treaty was signed. Violations are punished by WTO trade sanctions.</p>
<p>CODEX drastically restricts vitamins, minerals, herbs and other supplements. CODEX met secretly in November, 2004 and finalized ?Step 8 (the final stage)? to begin implementation in June, 2005.</p>
<p>The CODE includes: (1) No supplement can be sold for preventive or therapeutic use. (2) Any potency higher than RDA (minimal strength) is a ?drug? requiring a prescription and must be produced by drug companies. Over 5000 safe items now in health stores will be banned, terminating health stores as we now know them. (3) CODEX regulations become binding internationally. (4) New supplements are banned unless given very expensive CODEX testing and approval.</p>
<p>CODEX now applies to Norway and Germany, among others, where zinc tablets rose from $4 per bottle to $52. Echinacea (an ancient immune-enhancement herb) rose from $14 to $153 (both examples are now allowed by prescription only). They are now ?drugs?. Vitamin C above 200 mg, niacin above 32 mg, vitamin B6 above 4 mg ? all are banned over-the-counter as drugs. No amino acids (arginine, lysine, carnitine, etc. = essential amino acids!), essential fatty acids (omegas 3, 6, 9, etc.), or other essential supplements such as DMEA, DHEA, CoQ10, MSM, beta-carotene, etc. are allowed.</p>
<p>The CODEX rules are not based on real science. They are made by a few people meeting in secret (see web sites below), not necessarily scientists. In 1993 the FDA and drug corporations tried to put all supplements under restriction and prescription. But over 4 million Americans told Congress and the President to protect their freedom of choice on health supplements. The DSHEA Law was passed in 1994, which does so. But this will be over ruled by CODEX and the World Trade Organization.</p>
<p>Virtually nothing about it has been in the media. What the drug corporations have failed to do through Congress they have gotten by sneak attack through CODEX with the help of a silent media. What can be done at this late hour?</p>
<p>(1) Spread the word as much as possible. Inform yourselves fully at http://www.ahha.org, www.iahf.com and www.alliance-natural-health.org. (2) Oppose bills S. 722 and H.R. 3377. These support the CODEX restrictions with U.S. laws, changing the DSHEA law. (3) Support H.R. 1146 which would restore the sovereignty of the U.S. Constitution over CODEX, etc. (4) Express your wishes to the President, Senators and Representatives (They got us into this!) ASAP. (5) Contact multi-level health marketing groups that can get their members to inform the government. (6) Send donations, however small, to the British Alliance for Natural Health (see web site above). It has succeeded in challenging the CODEX directives in World Court later this month or next. They need help financially, having carried the fight effectively for everyone. CODEX and the FDA wish to protect us by controlling supplements in the same way they do prescription drugs.</p>
<p>A study of the latter by three medical scientists was reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association, April 15, 1998 ? Vol. 279, No. 15, p. 1200 ?Incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR?s) was found to be extremely high.? Covering 30 years (1966 to 1996) it was found that in the U.S. an average of 106,000 hospitalized patients per year (290 per day) die from ADR?s and 2,200,000 need more hospitalization for recovery.</p>
<p>These were FDA approved drugs, properly administered by competent professionals in hospitals ? none were considered malpractice. This is the number four cause of death in the U.S. When combined, these account for 7% of all hospitalized patients. This is equivalent to a 9-11 attack every ten days.</p>
<p>There are very few fatalities from supplements or the news would be on every front page. There is no need for more FDA control of supplements than is already in place, which is substantial. Instead of drastically restricting supplements, why doesn?t the FDA better control and restrict the extremely dangerous pharmaceutical drugs which are now killing us at the rate of a major airline crash per day?</p>

<p>Origins: &amp;#160; This e-mailed alert began circulating on the Internet in January 2005. Although the call to arms is worded in such a way as to convince those who receive that their right to purchase vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements in the U.S. is about to be lost to them unless they act decisively in defense of it, it is outdated and the facts of what is being considered by American lawmakers and why are radically dissimilar from the red cape being waved.</p>
<p></p>
<p>First of all, this is another case of an issue that is now largely moot due to outdated information. Back in 2003, two versions of a bill that proposed the regulation of dietary supplements ( <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:s.722:" type="external">S. 722</a>, the ?Dietary Supplement Safety Act of 2003,? and <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c108:h.r.3377:" type="external">H.R. 3377</a>, the ?Dietary Supplement Access and Awareness Act?) were introduced to Congress. Neither of these bills was ever voted upon, much less passed. They both expired with the end of the 108th Congress in 2004 and have not been reintroduced to the currently sitting 109th Congress.</p>
<p>Moreover, neither of these items of potential legislation was forced on the U.S. by an outside regulatory body, nor did they say anything about restricting the American public?s access to vitamins and minerals. Their sole target was dietary supplements, a class of products that has been unregulated since 1994, when Congress passed legislation that exempted them from federal regulation. Claims that your right to take vitamins and minerals is about to be impaired or that you will require doctors? prescriptions to obtain such products should be regarded as attempts at rabble-rousing, deliberate moves to spur you into action against one thing by convincing you that something very different and far closer to your heart is at stake.</p>
<p>Vitamins and minerals are not under the gun. Dietary supplements are. And no outside regulatory body is behind this move: the proposed legislation is the work of American lawmakers looking to safeguard the public from the unscrupulous and the hazardous. If you take nothing else from this article, take the preceding three sentences.</p>
<p>Despite their presence on store shelves, not all dietary supplements are safe for consumers to use, let alone are beneficial to their health. Products can be 100% natural yet deliver a deadly payload, as have some in the past. Lacking regulation of such ingestibles, there is no protection afforded consumers, and</p>
<p>authoritative-looking labels are no guarantee that what is being vended in those bottles they envelop is not harmful. Under current law, dangerous supplements get onto the market and stay there, with serious physical harm resulting among those who use them, as was the case with ephedra, which caused strokes, heart attacks, and upwards of 150 deaths before the Food and Drug Administration was finally able to get it out of the stores.</p>
<p>In 2004, according to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, almost one in five Americans (19%) reported using a supplement, which means the pool of folks at risk is great. Yet the incentives are there for the dietary supplement industry to keep on doing what it has been doing: in 2002, it reported $18.7 billion in sales. With so much profit at stake, there is little desire on the part of manufacturers to police themselves or their products all that carefully.</p>
<p>It?s not just about inherently dangerous substances being sold to the unwary as the latest miracle answer for what ails them ? even when dietary supplements contain nothing obviously harmful, the current lack of regulation results in improperly manufactured or contaminated products reaching the public. Quality control is missing. Absent regulation, consumers have little reason to trust they are getting the dosage they believe they are taking. ConsumerLab.com, an independent laboratory that tests dietary supplements, found that some name-brand products contain only small quantities of the active ingredient on their label. ?Some have none, some have 80 percent, some have 20 percent,? Dr. Tod Cooperman, president of the lab, told ABC News. Also, some contaminated supplements reach the market and thus fall into the hands of unknowing consumers. In December 2004, pesticide was found in ginseng being vended on the East Coast, and heavy metals such as mercury and arsenic were discovered in herbal supplements.</p>
<p>Two bills put before Congress in 2003 looked to regulate dietary nostrums by imposing quality and safety standards on them, and giving the FDA the ability to take them off the market before a great number of folks have been harmed by them. In March 2003, Senator Richard Durbin introduced bill <a href="http://www.ascpt.org/govaffairs/s722.pdf" type="external">S. 722</a>, the ?Dietary Supplement Safety Act of 2003? in the U.S. Senate. The purpose of this legislation was to ?protect consumers from dangerous dietary supplements such as ephedra and other stimulants by requiring manufacturers to submit proof that their product is safe prior to bringing it to market.? The bill would require manufacturers of the most dangerous types of dietary supplements (stimulants) to submit proof of their products? safety prior to bringing them to market. The bill also expands the FDA?s authority to require from any dietary supplement maker proof of its product?s safety if that agency has received information suggesting the product is causing death or other serious adverse health effects. It would also require manufacturers to report serious adverse health events (e.g.; heart attack, seizure, stroke, death), to the FDA no later than 15 calendar days after they learn of them. The bill also looks to close a loophole in current law that, according to Senator Durbin, ?has been exploited by many dietary supplement manufacturers, allowing anabolic steroids to be sold widely as dietary supplements? by clarifying that anabolic steroids are not dietary supplements and are subject to regulation that restricts their availability under the Controlled Substances Act.</p>
<p>In October 2003, Representatives Susan Davis (D-CA), Henry Waxman (D-CA) and John Dingell (DMI) introduced bill <a href="http://www.ascpt.org/govaffairs/legislation_congress/HR3377.pdf" type="external">H.R. 3377</a>, the ?Dietary Supplement Access and Awareness Act? in the U.S. House of Representatives. This legislation would increase the FDA?s authority over dietary supplements, enabling that agency to monitor the health risks of dietary supplements and take appropriate action if problems develop. The proposed law was not intended to have any impact on the regulation of vitamins and minerals, which are specifically excluded from the bill. In addition, for dietary supplements that contain herbs, amino acids, and other botanicals, the bill will ensure that FDA has basic information about who makes them and the products? ingredients. It would also require dietary supplement manufacturers to provide FDA with information about all adverse events, so that the agency could spot warning signs and investigate if necessary. It further allows the FDA to prohibit sales to minors of supplements that may cause significant harm to children. Finally, it allows the FDA to demand safety information from a manufacturer if the FDA has evidence that a particular supplement may pose serious risks.</p>
<p>Getting back to the e-mail?s claim that a foreign regulatory body is behind all this, we address the claim that:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Codex Alimentarius Commission was created in 1962 by two United Nations organizations, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization. It is the body of government representatives and non-governmental organizations charged by the United Nations with establishing a reference for international guidelines on food law. However, it has no power to force its will on any nation. Codex standards are voluntary; no country is obligated to adopt them.</p>
<p>In November 2004, the Codex Alimentarius Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses (CCNFSDU) reached agreement on the definitions and regulatory guidelines for the worldwide use of vitamins and minerals in food supplements and presented its ? <a href="http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/10206/cxg_055e.pdf" type="external">Guidelines for Vitamin and Mineral Food Supplements</a>? to the Codex annual meeting in Rome in July 2005. The Codex guidelines form a reference point that may be used in cases of international trade disputes in the area of food supplements. That, in a nutshell, is the extent of its teeth.</p>
<p>In the latter half of 2010, erroneous claims began to circulate claiming that President Obama had signed Codex Alimentarius regulations into law via <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/executive-order-establishing-national-prevention-health-promotion-and-public-health" type="external">Executive Order</a>. In fact, the referenced order simply ? in accordance with recently passed health care reform legislation (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) ? established the National Prevention, Health Promotion, and Public Health Council within the Department of Health and Human Services in order to provide federal coordination and leadership of ?prevention, wellness, and health promotion practices, the public health system, and integrative health care in the U.S.? The council so established has no specific power or mandate to regulate the sales of vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements.</p>

<p>What a game! The&amp;#160;U.S. and Japanese women?s soccer teams faced off for the World Cup yesterday afternoon, and after an electric overtime comeback by the Japanese team, Nadeshiko Japan went on to win the match in penalty kicks. For soccer fans, it was a heart-stopping finale. For American fans who have been consumed with the vitality of their women?s soccer team, it was so close?</p>
<p>But for the people of Japan, it was a miraculous demonstration of what determination and skill can bring. As team captain Homare Sawa said, on the morning of the final match, the opportunity to play was ?a gift from the soccer god.?&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
<p>What a reaction! Coming through the semi-finals against Mexico, Germany and then Sweden, Japan?s women?s soccer team took everyone by surprise. Like American fans here in the U.S., Japanese soccer fans gathered at sports bars and city auditoriums, energized by the power of their women athletes. Many of these dedicated fans got up in the middle of the night to watch the Frankfurt-based World Cup match. In the Monday morning interviews in Tokyo, there was not a dry eye in sight. Japan?s television announcers themselves could barely keep their voices steady, or their tears from overflowing. Like the Nadeshiko Japan athletes themselves, the country seems stunned but overjoyed.</p>
<p>What timing! And here it is not just the timing of the kicks that made it into the net, or the resilience of the Japanese team that came in at the end to take the lead from their dynamic American adversaries. Sawa, in her post-game interview, said that above all she and her teammates hoped their victory gave Japan?s disaster victims a sense of&amp;#160;power and hope. As incredible as these Japanese women athletes were on the field, we all understood that the women of Nadeshiko Japan knew it was not just soccer that was at stake. One of the players, Karina Maruyama, was a worker at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, and almost didn?t play because of the disaster. Coach Norio Sasaki reportedly reminded them of how much hope their presence in the finals alone brought to those at home. It was as if the entire country was playing in Germany. And, after they won, Japan?s athletes returned to the field with a sign thanking Japan?s friends around the world for their support in the wake of the March 11&amp;#160;disasters.</p>
<p>Japan?s women?s soccer team will arrive home in Japan today, tired and probably still stunned by their World Cup victory. As in so many countries around the world, this will change the lives of generations of Japanese women. They have emerged at the top of their game, claiming the World Cup, and reminding their country?and the world?that Japan has what it takes to compete. The soccer god must be smiling, indeed.</p>
<p>But for a devastated Tohoku, and for a deeply-exhausted Japan still grappling with the effects of the Great East Japan Earthquake, Japan?s women athletes are a godsend of a different sort. The women of Nadeshiko Japan have also shown the Japanese people that when Japan needs it the most, they really can muster the strength and the spirit to prevail.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Last weekend, Malaysia?s Bersih (clean elections) movement drew tens of thousands of protestors to the streets of Kuala Lumpur, demanding reform of the electoral system, which is weighted in numerous ways to protect the ruling coalition. Though the protest was largely peaceful, the government met the demonstration with massive force, arresting thousands of protestors. The police used clubs, water cannons, and tear gas to crush the protests. ( <a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/" type="external">New Mandala</a> has fine <a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2011/07/10/bersih-2-0-overcomes-police-state/" type="external">coverage</a> of the <a href="http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2011/07/10/it-was-brutal-najib/" type="external">Bersih protests</a>.)</p>
<p>As in Thailand, where the red shirt movement started largely as a pro-Thaksin protest and developed into a larger force, the Bersih movement, which began as just a call for electoral reform, also may be developing into something larger. The government?s brutal tactics have alienated many average Malaysians, who see their country, if not exactly a democracy, as a moderate and tolerant state. Such anger could help swell the ranks of the political opposition in advance of the next election, finally ousting the ruling coalition.</p>
<p>Yet as the <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/Prime+News/Story/STIStory_685017.html" type="external">Straits Times notes</a> [subscription required] in a fine analysis, the Bersih demonstrations also are <a href="http://www.chinapost.com.tw/commentary/the-china-post/special-to-the-china-post/2011/07/13/309681/Bersih-demonstration.htm" type="external">deepening a divide</a> in the country. As more protestors turn to the opposition, the government relies more and more on ethnic Malays, who have benefited from the ruling coalition?s decades of affirmative action policies. And the more the government relies on the Malay heartland, the more it turns off Chinese, Indian, and other voters, pushing them toward the opposition--and only reinforcing the ethnic divide in Malaysia.</p>

<p>Richard Suttmeier and Xiangkui Yao have just published a new and excellent paper on China?s intellectual property (IP) rights transition. It is well worth the read, and, until September 8, you can download it for free from the&amp;#160;National Bureau of Asian Research?s&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.nbr.org/publications/element.aspx?id=520" type="external">site</a>.</p>
<p>There is much good analysis of the 2006 Medium- to Long-Term Scientific and Technological Development, the 2008 National Intellectual Property Strategy, as well as the 2010 National Patent&amp;#160;Development&amp;#160;Strategy and how these and other policies fit into and help shape China?s emerging IP regime. &amp;#160;Suttmeier and Yao?s main argument seems to be that outside observers (and probably the Chinese themselves) have no idea which way China is going to go. We could be at the beginning of "harmonization", with Chinese laws and, more importantly, practices increasingly coming to look more like the rest of the world?s. Alternatively, the rise of strategic behavior and techno-nationalist policies could promote "tit for tat behavior" and create "an IP security dilemma that would undermine China?s aspirations and make international cooperation much more difficult."</p>
<p></p>
<p>Suttmeier and Yao keep their cards pretty close to their chests. After reading the report, it was hard for me to guess which outcome they thought was more likely. I have been pretty firmly in the second camp, believing that China?s strong state direction of technology policy, desire for autonomy from the West, and historical distrust of international IP regimes are a recipe for continued conflict and strife. But the report gave me plenty of data points to make me at least question that position.</p>
<p>The most interesting discussion in the paper is about the explosion of patents in China. &amp;#160;Questioning how <a href="" type="internal">innovative</a> these patents actually are is <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2011/BUSINESS/02/14/china.intellectual.property/index.html?section=cnn_latest" type="external">well</a>-trod <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/china-poised-to-lead-world-in-patent-filings/?hp" type="external">ground</a>. Suttmeier and Yao point out that China has become the most litigious society in the world, in terms of intellectual property. In 2009, there were 30,626 IP civil cases, and the number rose to 42,902 in 2010. Of those, there were 24,700 copyright cases, 8,460 trademark, and 5,785&amp;#160;patent. This can be compared to the United States where, in 2009, there were 2,192 copyright, 1,792 trademark, and 1,674 patent cases. Suttmeier and Yao argue that while the creation of well-defined property rights and a smoothly operating legal system are usually pluses for building an effective innovation system, the Chinese may in fact be creating a "hyper IPR environment" that undermines trust and cooperation. &amp;#160;Given how competitive Chinese markets are, it is not surprising that firms would seek advantages in the court. Yet all of this "legal combat" may make it more difficult to build cooperation among universities, firms, and research institutes--networks essential to promoting innovation.</p>
<p>People always point to litigation and lawyers as one of the great weakness of the U.S. innovation system, so it is interesting to think that China, which is always held up as the model of policy efficiency, may have similar "problems." &amp;#160;At any rate, go read the paper, it is well worth it.</p>

<p>As the major foreign actor in Thailand, U.S. policy toward the Kingdom remains critical, and closely watched by Thai opinion leaders. Following the 2006 coup in Thailand, for example, American policy signals that, in many ways, seemed to indicate that Washington tolerated the coup provided support for the Thai military, even though, in the long run, the coup produced only more chaos.</p>
<p>Now, in the wake of Thailand?s July 3 election, the United States may have a role to play again, if Thailand?s establishment is able to nullify the poll through judicial rulings or other maneuverings.</p>

<p>The United States has spent over thirty years trying to ?teach? China with, at best, mixed results. I think the time is well overdue for a turnabout in roles. We need to start learning from China.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about this issue for a long time, but reading Michael Dunne?s terrific new book <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470828617.html" type="external">American Wheels Chinese Roads: The Story of General Motors in China</a>, has convinced me that we can?t wait any longer. While not the central theme of Dunne?s book, it is an important concluding thought. Dunne underscores what I think should be the strategy for the United States as we anticipate a wave of Chinese capital flowing into the United States, and it boils down to taking a page from the Chinese playbook.</p>
<p>1)&amp;#160;If the Chinese want to do business here, they have to invest in manufacturing and jobs.</p>
<p>2)&amp;#160;If a Chinese industry requires joint ventures for our firms to do business in China, then we require the same when that business comes calling here.</p>
<p>3)&amp;#160;?Profits from operations stay inside the United States. Repatriation to China will be limited and will require approvals from the U.S. government?it?s just quid pro quid.?</p>
<p>For most of the book, Dunne leads up to this point with a fascinating story about GM?s adventures in China. He does what a lot of business books on China do?albeit in an entertaining way that only a few rival ( <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Mr-China-Tim-Clissold?isbn=9780060761400&amp;amp;HCHP=TB_Mr.+China" type="external">Mr. China</a> and <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470928077.html" type="external">Poorly Made in China</a> come to mind in this vein): He helps us &amp;#160;understand what it takes to make money in China. First off, you need nerves of steel. Dunne tells a very entertaining story right up front about Peter Badore, who negotiated on behalf of Chrysler. Badore would routinely arrive two days before his meetings to get adjusted to the time change in order to take away the advantage the Chinese had come to expect from Americans who were disoriented by the day to night transition. Badore defied all logic by talking non-stop for hours on end until the Chinese finally called uncle and gave in to his demands.&amp;#160; You also need a license, relationships, persistence, and an understanding of how Chinese culture and preferences differ from those in America.&amp;#160; For example, as Dunne discusses, over time, GM reworked its Buick to adjust for the fact that the Chinese like big cars but small engines that don?t guzzle gas.&amp;#160; They don?t care nearly as much as Americans about passing or getting a fast start off a stoplight.</p>
<p>Dunne?s book is worth reading for an inside scoop on an American company?s successes and travails in China, but the real value comes with his implicit warning:&amp;#160; The United States has a very slim window of opportunity to get our policy on Chinese investment right. If we don?t play tough up front, we will quickly be out of the game.</p>

<p>Senate <a href="http://foreign.senate.gov/" type="external">Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry</a> published an <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-kerry-north-korea-20110626,0,4538130.story" type="external">opinion column</a> in the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/" type="external">Los Angeles Times</a> last week urging the Obama administration to engage in direct diplomacy with North Korea by resuming Korean POW/MIA recovery operations active in the 1990s that had been suspended early in the Bush administration and by authorizing humanitarian aid in response to North Korea?s appeals. Last Monday, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/georgieva/whats_new/headlines/archives/2011/07/20110704_en.htm" type="external">European Union?s decision</a> to provide assistance to North Korea has <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2011/07/167723.htm#NORTHKOREA" type="external">arguably put more pressure on the Obama administration</a> to provide assistance following the <a href="" type="internal">dispatch of an assessment team</a> two months ago led by Ambassador for Human Rights Robert King. And the Obama administration?s nomination last Friday of Clinton-era special envoy for North Korea <a href="http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/07/01/it_s_official_sherman_nominated_as_undersecretary_of_state" type="external">Wendy Sherman as undersecretary of state for political affairs</a> has fed rampant speculation and anxiety among South Koreans that the United States is about to shift gears despite the Obama administration?s close coordination to date with South Korea on North Korea policy, especially given the <a href="" type="internal">downturn in inter-Korean relations</a>.</p>
<p>All these stories fill long-time Korea watchers with d?j? vu as Korea policy debates from the past are doomed to be repeated without taking into account lessons learned. The apparent successes of POW/MIA recovery operations with the North in the 1990s were underwritten by suitcases of cash payments to the North while the success of those missions depended on the political mood in Pyongyang, but subsequent experience has taught that cash transactions with North Korea should be avoided at all cost. Despite the ideal that a hungry child knows no politics, humanitarian aid was politicized in the 1990s and led to political dialogue, but it did not lead to progress in negotiations then and will not yield success in the Six Party Talks now. Humanitarian aid should be given based on need, not as a step toward political engagement.</p>
<p>The harder question is how to deal with North Korea following its rejection of inter-Korean dialogue and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmhcGwb599k" type="external">million person mobilization last Monday in Pyongyang?s central square</a> to demonstrate against South Korean president Lee Myung-Bak. North Korea?s political system is sustained by isolation from the outside world, but it also can breed miscalculation. The Obama administration?s ?strategic patience? borders on acquiescence to a nuclear North Korea in the absence of either Chinese coercion against North Korea or cooperation to achieve the North?s denuclearization, but direct dialogue with North Korea runs the risk of rewarding Pyongyang while marginalizing the South.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Prior instances where the United States engaged with North Korea occurred either at peaks in inter-Korean relations (the 1992 Kim Young Sun-Arnold Kanter meeting following the signing of the inter-Korean Basic Agreement and in October of 2000 after the first inter-Korean summit) or occurred because prior frameworks existed that indirectly facilitated low-level inter-Korean contacts (the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization and the Four Party Talks during a low point in inter-Korean relations in 1996-97 under South Korean President Kim Young Sam). The missing ingredient for diplomatic engagement with the North under current circumstances is the absence of a preexisting framework for promoting both a U.S.-DPRK and an inter-Korean dialogue.</p>
<p>If there is a need to have direct contact with North Korea in the absence of a stable inter-Korean relationship, it will be necessary to establish such a framework. One way of doing this would be for the American, Japanese, and South Korean foreign ministers to jointly propose a dialogue on North Korean missile development and missile defense (an issue not addressed in the dormant Six Party framework or the <a href="http://www.state.gov/p/eap/regional/c15455.htm" type="external">2005 Joint Statement</a>) that would be accompanied by a North Korean pledge to maintain a moratorium on missile testing. At the same time, the three foreign ministers should reaffirm the importance of North Korea returning to denuclearization under the Six Party Talks. Such a proposal would provide a framework for further dialogue on an issue that both the <a href="http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00100&amp;amp;num=7805" type="external">current</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/world/asia/12military.html" type="external">former defense secretaries</a> have identified as a potential direct threat to the United States without undermining the Six Party consensus on the necessity of denuclearization. As with the Clinton-Kim Young Sam Four Party Talks proposal of the mid-1990s, it will not be easy to secure North Korea?s participation in such a dialogue, but it may still be worth proposing, if only to give North Korea?s opaque leadership one more thing to argue about as they sort out the gap between the ideal of achieving a ?strong and prosperous state? and the reality of North Korea?s pariah status in 2012.</p>

<p>As politicians in Tokyo continue to flounder in their efforts to look forward, it continues to impress upon me the importance of understanding what is going right in Japan?s recovery effort. Last time I shared a story that reflects the ability of individual Japanese to innovate and cope during the crisis. Today it is a story of Japan?s technological prowess?harnessed in the service of&amp;#160;social need?that I want to share with you from my recent trip to Tohoku.</p>
<p>For many Japanese and non-Japanese alike, nothing symbolizes Japan?s technological wizardry more than the Shinkansen, Japan?s high speed ?bullet? train. Since it first impressed the world during the 1964 Olympics, the ?bullet? train has gone through numerous upgrades and transformations, and has a spotless record of zero fatalities.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
<p>But for those in Tohoku, the Shinkansen is more than a fast train. It is the region?s lifeline. The Shinkansen?s return to Tohoku after the disaster interrupted operations on March 11 was met with great emotion, and symbolized the beginning of the painful journey to restoring life in the northeast.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>What seems less appreciated is what actually happened in the midst of the earthquake. When the 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck at approximately 2:46 pm on March 11, the miracle was that no major structures carrying the Shinkansen were destroyed. Viaducts were reinforced against earthquakes, and these held even in the face of Japan?s largest recorded earthquake.</p>
<p>JR East runs the <a href="http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/routemaps/index.html" type="external">882-mile Shinkansen network</a>from Tokyo to Shin-Aomori in the north, and west to Nagano, Niigata, Shinjou and Akita?nearly double the 456-mile <a href="http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;amp;pagename=am%2FLayout&amp;amp;cid=1246041980246" type="external">Amtrak Northeast Corridor</a> connecting Washington, Philadelphia, New York and Boston. The company runs 310-415 trains, carrying about 241,000 passengers, daily.</p>
<p>Even more incredible is the precision of JR East?s early earthquake detection system. When the coastline seismometer detected the first wave of seismic activity emanating from the epicenter offshore, the JR substation shut power to the entire Shinkansen system. Emergency brakes were then applied to all trains. At the time of the March 11 quake, two trains running at about 170 mph (270 km/hr) through the Sendai area were directly exposed to the 9.0 earthquake?s vibrations. The power supply to these trains was cut 9-12 seconds before the first wave arrived, followed by the application of their&amp;#160;emergency brakes. The largest vibration hit the Shinkansen trains about 70 seconds after their emergency brakes were applied, and JR East estimates that by that time their speeds had dropped to 63 mph (100 km/hr). The sensitivity of this early warning system allowed a rapid drop in speed, and a smooth halt for the two trains immediately subjected to this tremendous earthquake.</p>
<p>Twenty seven trains ran up and down the JR East Tohoku Shinkansen line at the time of the earthquake: fifteen were heading north to Shin-Aomori and twelve were heading south to Tokyo. In addition, 670 conventional trains were in operation on the JR East tracks.</p>
<p>Friends of mine were in a train halfway between Tokyo and Sendai, and told me of their nearly twelve-hour wait in the stopped train before they were evacuated along the tracks to a nearby shelter. Calm and quiet, the passengers waited for word on what had happened, but only learned later of the extent of Japan?s calamity.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Yet not one passenger on that line was hurt; not one person lost their life. No Shinkansen trains were derailed. Station staff and train crew led all passengers to emergency evacuation areas before the tsunami arrived.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Damage to the JR East lines was extensive, however. 1,200 sites on the Shinkansen line were damaged, and around 4,400 sites on the conventional lines were affected by the earthquake. Additional damages were incurred as frequent aftershocks of magnitude 5.0 or more continued to affect the train lines. The tsunami damages were considerable on the seven lines along the coast that were directly hit by the wave (about 1,730 sites were affected by the tsunami alone).</p>
<p>But the JR East?s crisis management and recovery effort was quick, and effective. 8,500 employees worked each day to return the Shinkansen to operation, and within 49 days of the Great East Japan Earthquake, the Tohoku Shinkansen arrived back in service to a community desperately in need of assistance.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Sendai station master Hideaki Watanabe proudly greeted the first train to return. From the photo above, clearly the people of Tohoku welcomed back the rapid rail system that sustains connections between the Tokyo metropolis and the rural northeast. But it was the technology and the commitment of Japan?s much admired Shinkansen operators that speak to the broader strengths of Japan. Precision and the pursuit of perfection are the hallmarks of Japan?s modern industry, and the Shinkansen reflects the technological resources available to Japan?s recovery.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
<p>But most impressive is not simply the amazing technology that allowed Tohoku to avoid further loss of life than might be expected, but rather the JR East?s story?like many stories one finds in post-March 11 Japan?reflects Japan?s capacity to organize that technology in support of a society that seeks to go further and do better at each step of its way forward.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
<p>This is the spirit that ought to lead Japan?s recovery.</p>

<p>Nine months after the <a href="" type="internal">original brouhaha</a> over China?s plans to decrease dramatically its exports of rare earths, the international community has called foul again on a closely related issue: China?s export curbs on other raw materials, such as magnesium and silicon. On July 5th, the World Trade Organization (WTO) <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-05/wto-bolsters-complaints-over-china-exports.html" type="external">ruled</a> that China had violated WTO rules when it curbed its exports of these and other raw materials. (Thus far, the Chinese response to the first ruling has been muted, but all indications are that Beijing will appeal the ruling.)</p>
<p>Now China is worried that it will face a similar suit on rare earths. Whether it would fare better in such a case is uncertain, but unlikely. The <a href="http://professional.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703509104576331010793763864.html" type="external">WTO allows</a> for export restrictions when a country is trying to conserve non-renewable&amp;#160;natural resources, which China is clearly trying to do. The hitch is that this exception also demands similar restrictions on domestic production and consumption. China can?t offer more favorable policies to its own companies than to the rest of the world. That is going to be a high bar for China to meet.</p>
<p>With regard to rare earths, just one day after the WTO ruling, Deputy Commerce Minister Zhong Shan has <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-07/06/c_13968838.htm" type="external">said</a> that regulation of rare earths would proceed according to Chinese and WTO law, but he didn?t elaborate as to whether Chinese regulations would be modified if they conflicted with WTO rules. He stressed that ?Improving the regulation of rare earth exports will help us to protect the environment and promote industrial restructuring, as well as allow the rare earth industry to develop in a healthy way.? Meanwhile such ?regulation? is causing a dramatic jump in rare earth prices. Already in the first half of 2011, China cut its rare earth exports by 35 percent, precipitating a rapid rise in prices. For example, dysprosium, a metal used in hybrid cars and smartphones, has increased in price twelve-fold over the past year.</p>
<p>The challenge for the rest of the world, as some of the commentators on <a href="" type="internal">my post</a> on this topic last fall suggested, is that there is no quick fix. Developing alternative sources -- whether in <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/GTSOs-First-Mongolian-Rare-bw-2431219439.html?x=0&amp;amp;.v=1" type="external">Mongolia</a>, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/06/us-rareearths-underwater-idUSTRE7655M320110706" type="external">Australia</a>, or the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/06/us-rareearths-underwater-idUSTRE7655M320110706" type="external">United States</a> -- will take time. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/06/us-rareearths-underwater-idUSTRE7655M320110706" type="external">Exploitation of undersea reserves</a>, which recently made a big splash in the media, may turn out to be folly or prohibitively expensive. At the very least, it will take time to realize. And developing and deploying substitutes for rare earths will in many instances require massive and costly shifts in manufacturing.</p>
<p>In the end, the brightest spot for the rest of the world may be the potential for Chinese actions to spur a significant global effort on rare earths recovery and recycling. Already, Japanese, American, and French companies have developed <a href="http://www.recyclingportal.eu/topartikel/26782.shtml" type="external">new</a> <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/03/11/idUK427286472320110311" type="external">technologies</a> to extract some of these rare earths from washing machines, batteries, and air conditioners. &amp;#160;How much of global demand this recycling can meet remains to be seen, but it is all upside. Maybe there is a neodymium lining to all of this after all. I?ll keep you posted.</p>

<article id="0000539" published-at="2005-03-02" title="U.S., France tell Syria to pull out of Lebanon / Mideast events give Washington, Paris new reason to unite"><p>2005-03-02 04:00:00 PDT London -- The United States and France together called on Syria on Tuesday to withdraw its troops from Lebanon, just a day after the pro-Syrian government of Lebanon collapsed under popular pressure.</p>
<p>In a joint appearance, U.S. Secretary of State <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Condoleezza+Rice%22" type="external">Condoleezza Rice</a> and French Foreign Minister <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Michel+Barnier%22" type="external">Michel Barnier</a>, both in London to attend a daylong conference on supporting the Palestinian Authority, demanded the "immediate withdrawal of all Syrian military and intelligence forces from Lebanon."</p>
<p>"There cannot be any pretexts, any excuses not to carry it out," Barnier said, while promising that France and the United States would seek ways to guarantee Lebanon's security and independence.</p>
<p>Their joint call came as jubilant anti-Syria politicians in Beirut scrambled to maneuver in the changed political landscape.</p>
<p>Rice said the United States would support sending international observers for Lebanon's elections in May and that sending international peacekeepers to take the place of departing Syrian forces was under consideration.</p>
<p>"Events in Lebanon are moving in a very important direction," Rice said. "I think we have to look at what can be done in terms of helping them to stabilize the situation, should that become necessary."</p>
<p>The joint news conference might have seemed unlikely just a few months ago, given the angry words between France and the Bush administration over the war in Iraq. But in Lebanon and in the search for peace in the Middle East, the United States and France have found two areas of mutual concern and agreement.</p>
<p>Syria maintains about 15,000 troops in Lebanon, but has promised repeatedly over the years to withdraw them. In an interview with <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Time+magazine%22" type="external">Time magazine</a> published Tuesday, Syrian President <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Bashar+Assad%22" type="external">Bashar Assad</a> restated his vow of last week that he would pull his troops out in the next few months.</p>
<p><a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Imad+Moustapha%22" type="external">Imad Moustapha</a>, the Syrian ambassador to the United States, said recently that military intelligence officers were the only Syrian intelligence personnel in Lebanon, and that they would be withdrawn along with the rest of the military. But U.S. officials said they were dubious that military officers were the only Syrian intelligence officers in Lebanon, suggesting that the issue might be a point of contention even if the Syrians withdraw.</p>
<p>Rice, in a second news conference on Tuesday evening, pointedly said Syrian security services must leave Lebanon.</p>
<p>Rice and Barnier reiterated calls for a full, credible and transparent investigation into the assassination two weeks ago of former Prime Minister <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Rafik+Hariri%22" type="external">Rafik Hariri</a>, a killing that the Lebanese opposition attributes to Syria. The assassination ignited daily protests in Beirut by tens of thousands of people calling for a Syrian withdrawal, leading in turn Monday to the resignation of Lebanon's pro-Syrian prime minister and his Cabinet.</p>
<p>In Lebanon, the abrupt resignation of Prime Minister <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Omar+Karami%22" type="external">Omar Karami</a>'s government invigorated the broad alliance that has coalesced since Hariri's assassination.</p>
<p>But the government's dissolution marks only one step along the path to the opposition's stated goal of driving the 15,000 Syrian troops from Lebanon, dismantling intelligence services and electing a parliament this spring that is less beholden to the Syrian government.</p>
<p>Opposition leaders began considering their next moves with particular attention to applying pressure on President <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Emile+Lahoud%22" type="external">Emile Lahoud</a>, whose term was extended last fall by parliament under pressure from Syria. Lahoud, a Maronite Christian, is a favorite of Syria's government and still holds significant political influence within Lebanon's power-sharing system.</p>
<p>Despite growing calls during now-daily street demonstrations for Lahoud's resignation, some opposition figures said they believe his departure could leave a potentially dangerous vacuum.</p>
<p>"Lahoud is almost finished," said <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Walid+Jumblatt%22" type="external">Walid Jumblatt</a>, the Druze parliamentary leader who has emerged as de facto head of the opposition. "But it would be better to have a new parliament with elections that would also elect a new president. We need a new president. We cannot stay like this for a couple more years."</p>
<p>Jumblatt, who supported the Syrian military presence during the Israeli occupation of a swath of southern Lebanon, has become the most strident voice in favor of Syria's withdrawal. Under the agreement that ended the civil war, Syria was required to withdraw its troops to the eastern Bekaa Valley within two years, which it hasn't done.</p>
<p>"If the Syrians think they can hold Lebanon hostage on this issue, then they are mistaken," Jumblatt said.</p>
<p>Lahoud, the former head of the Lebanese army, has remained largely silent while the political drama has played out on Beirut's streets and on the floor of parliament. But the president will begin consulting members of parliament today on a new government, a constitutionally required process in which the opposition has yet to decide officially whether it will participate.</p></article>
<article id="0000546" published-at="2014-02-11" title="Abbott Enlists Chuck Norris ? and His Facts ? to Raise Money"><p>A new fundraising effort by the <a href="" type="internal">Greg Abbott</a> campaign enlists Chuck Norris and, in a humorous twist, references the popular internet meme " <a href="http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com/chuck-norris-favorite-facts" type="external">Chuck Norris Facts</a>."</p>
<p>The letter, sent out under the name of the actor known for his portrayal of Walker, Texas Ranger, <a href="" type="internal">reads</a>:</p>
<p>"You're no doubt familiar with 'Chuck Norris Facts.' For example, did you know that ghosts sit around campfires telling Chuck Norris stories?</p>

<p>"These attacks are no laughing matter. They're well-funded and well-organized. And that's why your help is so important."</p>
<p>Abbott spokesman Matt Hirsch confirmed the authenticity of the letter. "Chuck Norris has been a longtime supporter of Greg Abbott, dating back to his first campaign for Attorney General, and we're proud to have his continued support in the current campaign for governor," Hirsch said.

<article id="0000547" title=""><p>As News Hounds Priscilla has <a href="" type="internal">pointed</a> <a href="" type="internal">out</a>, Fox has been exploiting the criminal case against abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell to advance its anti-abortion agenda and its ?liberal? media victimhood. But nothing, in my opinion, has matched the howler of Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn ? whose <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Marsha_Blackburn.htm" type="external">voting record</a> earned her a 25% rating from the NAACP and 0% from NARAL ? going on The O?Reilly Factor and pretending to be acting out of concern for minority women. Bill O?Reilly ? who has his own <a href="" type="internal">dubious</a> <a href="" type="internal">record</a> <a href="" type="internal">on</a> <a href="" type="internal">minorities</a> <a href="" type="internal">and</a> <a href="" type="internal">women</a> ? gave her a pass.</p>
<p>As Priscilla noted, the Gosnell case is actually a poster child for the need to keep abortions legal and accessible to poor women. She wrote about a <a href="" type="internal">previous discussion</a> of the case on The Five (whose panel also developed a sudden interest in minorities):</p>
<p>While those ?pro-lifers? on ?The Five? are concerned about poor, minority children, they don?t seem to be as concerned about poor, minority women who went to Dr. Gosnell because Medicaid doesn?t cover abortion and Gosnell offered low prices. Thanks to ?pro-lifers,? abortion is becoming less accessible and affordable. ?Pro-lifers? want to shut down Planned Parenthood and that will mean that poor, minority women will have less access to contraception and that, in turn, will result in more unplanned pregnancies and more unsafe abortions like those done by Gosnell. But the pro-lifers on ?The Five? care about poor, minority babies - women, not so much!</p>
<p>In other words, we can probably expect even more abortion butchers preying on minority women as the result of the kinds of restrictions on abortion that folks like Blackburn and Bill O?Reilly salivate over.</p>
<p>So it was hard to know whether to laugh or cry when Blackburn held up ?poor women in minority neighborhoods? as one of her concerns for joining other members of Congress in leaning on the other networks for not covering the case enough.</p>
<p>Are they not covering it because it is poor women in minority neighborhoods or is it because they ideologically and politically are trying to cover abortion practices even in cases such as the Gosnell house of horrors?</p>
<p>?What we want to make certain is that there is justice for these victims and that this practice is ended.</p>
<p>At least O?Reilly ? famous for his <a href="" type="internal">long smear campaign</a> against abortion Dr. George that <a href="" type="internal">continues</a> even after Tiller was assassinated ? didn?t seem to buy the BS about any interest in minority women. He led her away from that subject to attacking the news outlets. ?They don?t want to cover any story that puts abortion per se in a bad light. And I think that?s what this is all about from your point of view,? he said suggestively.</p>
<p>Even if what he said was true (and I dispute that it is), I thought we were supposed to celebrate the fact that we have a diverse media that is free to cover whatever they want. Since the Constitution seems not to take into account that Fox News has been elected Chief of America?s Media Police, maybe it?s time to amend the First Amendment.</p>
<p>Blackburn would probably vote in favor. She agreed with O?Reilly about the media before moving along to throw in attacks on Planned Parenthood as somehow being involved in ?ridiculously unsafe, mass-market style abortion clinics.? Plus, she worked in a swipe at President Obama for speaking at a Planned Parenthood fundraiser (which he has now <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/apr/24/obama-backs-out-planned-parenthood-address/" type="external">canceled</a>).</p>
<p>O?Reilly promised ?a major Factor investigation? on Monday.</p>
<p>If Blackburn and O?Reilly really cared about minority women and children they?d spend a lot less time undermining their welfare by attacking abortion rights and monitoring their reproductive behavior and spend a lot more time focused on how to improve their well-being once the fetus leaves its mother?s uterus.</p></article>

<p>Progress in U.S. Household Deleveraging</p>
<p>A report from the <a href="http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Economic_Studies/Country_Reports/Working_out_of_debt_2914" type="external">McKinsey Global Institute</a> examined the deleveraging progress in the United States, the UK, and&amp;#160; Spain, and offers a comparison to past (1990's) recoveries in Sweden, Finland, and South Korea. U.S. households have experienced the most significant debt reduction out the countries reviewed, with defaults representing from 70 to 80 percent of the decrease. The report suggests U.S. households could be halfway through the deleveraging process, with one to two years to go.</p>
<p>Ron Haskins of the <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2012/0119_budget_haskins.aspx" type="external">Brookings Institution</a> says that the economy and the budget deficit are the biggest issues in the 2012 election. The next president, he recommends, should take the following steps to address the deficit crisis: open bipartisan talks where everything is on the table; push for control of Medicare spending along the lines of existing bipartisan proposals; and reform the budget process- specifically reinstitute "paygo" requirements for all future spending programs.</p>

<p>A report released by the Louisiana Section of the <a href="http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/01/state_infrastructure_graded_be.html" type="external">American Society of Civil Engineers (NOLA)</a> says the state's infrastructure is inadequately maintained and below average in most areas. The <a href="http://www.lasce.org/documents/LouisianaInfastructureReportCard2012.pdf" type="external">2012 Report Card</a>&amp;#160;grades nine areas of state infrastructure-- Louisiana scored above average in only two: dams (B-) and solid waste systems (C+).</p>
<p>The American Society of Civil Engineers says the 112th Congress has made little progress on <a href="http://blogs.asce.org/govrel/" type="external">key legislation</a>, but adds that infrastructure could be a top priority in 2012. Issues facing Congress in the near term include a reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and surface transportation authorization.</p>
<p>This CFR Backgrounder says an overhaul of <a href="" type="internal">U.S. transportation infrastructure</a> may help spur the economy, improve global competitiveness, and address homeland security needs.

<p>The White House has recently been trumpeting the small signs of revival in U.S. manufacturing. After shedding more than 2.2 million jobs since 2007, U.S. manufacturers have added about 330,000 jobs over the past two years.</p>
<p>The fledgling recovery appears to be driven by several factors:</p>
<p>? slightly higher labor costs in China and falling U.S. labor costs due to the recession and the new ?two-tier? union wage deals that keep down wages and benefits for new hires in unionized sectors;</p>
<p>? cheaper U.S. energy costs, largely due to falling natural gas prices because of the rising quantities of domestic shale gas;</p>
<p>? higher overseas transportation costs due to continued high oil prices;</p>
<p>? Finally, there is probably some natural correction occurring as a result of too many companies overestimating the savings they would realize by offshoring to China.</p>
<p>This is an encouraging trend. Manufacturing is a highly productive, well-paid sector of the economy. There is increasing evidence that future product and process innovation depend on maintaining a <a href="http://hbr.org/2009/07/restoring-american-competitiveness/ar/1" type="external">robust manufacturing capability</a>. Manufacturing companies have <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-18/auto-plants-at-capacity-buoying-all-parts-of-u-s-economy-cars.html" type="external">deep&amp;#160; linkages throughout the economy</a> ? the typical manufacturing job produces about 1.7 spinoff jobs. And the U.S. has real advantages in some of the new manufacturing technologies. My friend <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-innovations/why-its-chinas-turn-to-worry-about-manufacturing/2012/01/10/gIQAoRVJpP_story.html" type="external">Vivek Wadhwa</a> has argued that customized manufacturing processes will reduce the competitive advantages of low-cost mass production and play to American strengths.</p>
<p>But manufacturing is not about to become an engine of U.S. job growth. U.S. manufacturing output still remains about 10 percent below its pre-recession peak, and employment is still nearly two million jobs below its November 2007, pre-recession level. The number of manufacturing jobs, even with the slight uptick, remains the lowest in 70 years. Even as output grows, employment is unlikely to approach anything like former levels.</p>
<p>There is a superb piece in this month?s <a href="//www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/01/making-it-in-america/8844/." type="external">Atlantic</a>magazine that lays out more clearly than anything I?ve seen why manufacturing companies will create few jobs, even if the U.S. share of global manufacturing manages to grow. The story puts real human faces on the concept of ?productivity.? It demonstrates why the growing potential for automation to replace labor as a result of computers and robotics is simply too strong to resist, and how the future will increasingly consist of machines making things rather than people making things.</p>
<p>What this means is that, even as the manufacturing sector will continue to grow, the United States will need to look to other industries for robust, higher-wage job growth. My bet is on the business services sector, in fields such as engineering services, movie and software production, and telecommunications where demand for U.S. services is growing rapidly, especially in the emerging markets. Brad Jensen of Georgetown University and the Peterson Institute has laid out the case in his excellent <a href="http://bookstore.piie.com/book-store/6017.html" type="external">new book</a>. These sectors already employ twice as many people at higher average wages than in manufacturing, and job growth has been strong over the past decade. The United States runs a steadily rising trade surplus in services, compared with a deep, chronic deficit in manufacturing trade. These are sectors in which the United States, along with Europe, has a strong comparative advantage and the potential to sell much more to the world.</p>
<p>No one sector is going to dig the United States out of the jobs hole we currently find ourselves. But manufacturing is a particularly poor candidate.</p>

<p>President Obama requested Congressional approval last Friday to reorganize the federal government, a plan that includes consolidation of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/01/13/government-reorganization-fact-sheet" type="external">six trade and commerce agencies</a> into a single, streamlined department. The creation of an umbrella department is geared toward the administration's goal of increasing the competitiveness of U.S. companies in the global economy, and spurring export-led growth.</p>
<p>Through his National Export Initiative, the president has pledged to <a href="" type="internal">double U.S. exports</a> within five years, which he argues would create up to <a href="http://trade.gov/nei/nei-introduction-state-of-the-union-012710.asp" type="external">two million new jobs</a>. Some lawmakers welcomed the proposal as a necessary <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/commerce-revamp-could-weaken-trade-policy/2012/01/13/gIQALAVNwP_story.html?tid=pm_business_pop" type="external">reduction in the size of government (WashPost)</a>, while critics questioned the logic of creating a "new bureaucratic behemoth" to enhance efficiency.</p>
<p>What's at Stake</p>
<p>Specifics of the White House proposal are forthcoming, but any plan that enhances the ability of U.S. corporations to tap into the global marketplace could have significant ramifications for domestic job creation and economic growth. Exports supplied nearly half of U.S. <a href="" type="internal">GDP growth in 2010</a>, and access to foreign markets is likely to be a primary factor in the country's longterm prosperity. The <a href="http://trade.gov/nei/" type="external">Department of Commerce</a> reports that 95 percent of global consumers live outside the United States, while the IMF states that roughly 87 percent of global growth over the next five years will take place overseas.</p>
<p>A CFR task force report on <a href="" type="internal">U.S. trade</a> emphasizes the trend: "With the fastest growth now taking place in emerging markets that are often unfamiliar to U.S. companies, the U.S. government needs to expand its trade promotion efforts." The United States currently ranks second-to-last among developed economies in trade as a percentage of GDP. In <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-13/u-s-trade-deficit-widened-more-than-forecast-to-47-8-billion.html" type="external">November 2011 (Bloomberg)</a>, the U.S. trade gap hit a five-month high, exceeding analysts' estimates at $47.8 billion.</p>
<p>The Debate</p>
<p>The White House claims a consolidated trade/commerce department would eliminate redundancies and provide U.S. firms and small businesses in particular with a "one-stop shop" in navigating the federal bureaucracy. The administration expects the plan to garner bipartisan support, but some legislators have already pushed back.</p>
<p>A joint statement from Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-MT) and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-MI) criticized the idea of folding the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/commerce-revamp-could-weaken-trade-policy/2012/01/13/gIQALAVNwP_story.html?tid=pm_business_pop" type="external">office of the U.S. Trade Representative (WashPost)</a> into the proposed new department, saying it would hurt U.S. exports and job creation. Amy Wilkinson, a public policy scholar at Harvard's Kennedy School, raised questions over integrating the Small Business Administration into a "larger bureaucracy," saying it should be at <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/01/16/opinion/wilkinson-small-business/index.html" type="external">cabinet level (CNN)</a>. David Rothkopf of <a href="http://rothkopf.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/01/13/goodbye_commerce_department_you_won_t_be_missed" type="external">ForeignPolicy.com</a> called the consolidation long overdue and "an excellent initial step toward more sweeping reforms."</p>
<p>Policy Options</p>
<p>Outside of agency restructuring, experts have a variety of suggestions for how Washington can revive trade. Former Senator Tom Daschle says the U.S. needs a more <a href="" type="internal">assertive trade policy</a>, and recommends the Congress grant the president greater leeway to negotiate trade agreements under the Trade Promotion Authority. "We haven't had TPA authority now for many years," he says, "and it's not a coincidence that the trade agenda has languished.</p>
<p>The Peterson Institute's C. Fred Bergsten says the United States should first attain a fully competitive <a href="" type="internal">exchange rate for the dollar</a>. "The bulk of our current misalignment," he notes, "is vis-?-vis the Chinese renminbi and small group of other Asian currencies, which must be permitted to strengthen substantially."</p>
<p>Background Materials</p>
<p>This CFR Task Force report on <a href="" type="internal">U.S. Trade and Investment Policy</a> recommends several new policies to spur exports and increase the competitiveness of U.S. firms abroad, including an ambitious trade-negotiations agenda, a robust and strategic trade enforcement effort, a comprehensive worker retraining policy, and more competitive export financing.</p>

<p>CFR?s Renewing America initiative is premised on the simple idea that the United States? ability to influence world events rests on a robust, competitive economy. If economic growth remains anemic and long-term problems continue to go unaddressed, then America?s foreign policy capacity will falter. The United States will gradually lose its still unmatched ability to influence friends and adversaries, to shape international institutions, and ultimately to project its military power to defends vital national interests.</p>
<p>What is the problem that the Renewing America initiative addresses?</p>
<p>The short version is that, like Latin America in the 1980s and much of Asia in the 1990s, the American economy needs significant restructuring. Over the past several decades, the U.S. economy has become far more enmeshed with the rest of the world. In 1970 <a href="" type="internal">international trade</a> was just 10 percent of the U.S. economy; today it is more than 25 percent. Some of this was a result of deliberate market-opening policies, but much was driven by improvements in technology and rising wealth around the world.</p>
<p>While these developments have contributed to unprecedented global prosperity and what has been called the <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/072c87e6-1841-11e0-88c9-00144feab49a.html#axzz1iQyLFHNu" type="external">great convergence</a> between developing and developed countries, they are also forcing a sobering re-evaluation of America?s strengths and weaknesses. Job creation has stalled over the past decade, wages have been stagnant or falling for most workers, the U.S. share of foreign investment has been declining, and government debt burdens have been growing. Other countries have closed the gap on what were once large U.S. advantages in education, infrastructure, research and development. The United States is simply not as competitive in the new global economy as it must be to expand high-wage employment.</p>
<p>Nor has the U.S. political system shown much capacity for addressing these problems. The economics columnist <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/a-country-in-denial-about-its-fiscal-future/2011/12/23/gIQACLjpHP_story.html" type="external">Bob Samuelson summed it up best</a> recently: ?We are shifting,? he wrote, ?from ?giveaway politics? to ?takeaway politics,?? and neither of the two political parties is much interested in participating. Half a century of rising social spending and low taxes has produced a coming fiscal train wreck that will require the government to give less to more Americans and take away more ? even as public investments must be made to build the foundation for future prosperity.</p>
<p>None of these trends will inevitably continue. Similar warnings about U.S. economic challenges in the 1980s proved short-lived, both because of technological breakthroughs that originated in the United States (especially the personal computer and internet revolutions) and because the challenges facing America?s economic rivals proved even more serious. There is also a great opportunity. As <a href="" type="internal">Richard Haass has written</a>, the relative absence of security threats today should allow the United States to refocus on domestic economic priorities and tackle these problems.</p>
<p>But neither can it be assumed that the United States will rise to the challenge. It will take both extraordinary collective and individual effort, and perhaps a bit of luck. Unlike the fast-growing economies in the developing world, advanced economies like the United States and those in Europe cannot mimic their way to greater prosperity. For most developing countries, it is enough to do what the advanced countries have already done, but at lower cost; for the United States, new and better ways must be found to create and deliver desirable goods and services.</p>
<p>CFR?s Renewing America initiative will sponsor research and dialogue aimed at facilitating this economic restructuring. On these pages we will offer original and insightful research and policy prescriptions from some of the nation?s finest scholars and practitioners. We will publish installments of the ?Renewing America Scorecard,? which will analyze policy developments is such key areas as infrastructure, education, international trade, and government deficits. The award-winning CFR.org staff will produce daily updates with links to key political and economic developments, and will offer regular backgrounders on the policy issues and debates. And finally, I will be offering my own take on these issues two to three times a week, and will be looking to share fresh insights and ideas from our readers.</p>

<p>When this post goes up Turkish electoral officials will likely still be tallying the results of Sunday?s do-over parliamentary elections. Like the voting that took place on June 7, this round is widely regarded to be crucial. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan?s quest for the executive presidency, the coherence of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), the integration and normalization of the Kurdish-based People?s Democratic Party (HDP), and the quality of Turkish politics going forward are all thought to be riding on the outcome. If the pre-election polling is accurate?and they have been stable for months?Turks will be faced with the same, inconclusive result that they produced five months ago, resolving nothing. Then again, anything can happen. I have been told that Turkey?s political institutions are both robust and meaningful, giving them the capacity to process people?s grievances and prevent excesses of both winners and losers. I have my doubts. Last June?s elections were supposed to have proven the resilience of Turkey?s democracy, but Erdogan demonstrated his ability to manipulate the political system because the elections did not go his way. Turkey is actually more fragile than people believe.</p>
<p>One of the paradoxes&amp;#160;of the AKP era is that it has reproduced many of the pathologies it sought to resolve thirteen years ago. In 2002, but certainly by 2007, Erdogan, with the help of Abdullah Gul and other party leaders, took a badly split electorate and forged a broad coalition of religious Turks, Kurds, big business, cosmopolitan elites, and average Turks to political victory on the promise of a wealthier, Western-integrated, and more pious society. Part of the AKP?s appeal at the time was its potential to resolve what had been, in the context of Turkish politics, the inability to reconcile the competing desires to be part of the West and reaffirm its Muslim identity. When the European Commission offered Turkey a formal invitation to begin European Union membership negotiations in October 2004, the economy was growing after a wrenching financial crisis in 2000 and 2001. Moreover, Turks were given an opportunity to explore their Muslim identities with greater freedom and Erdogan rallied millions of Turks around what seemed like his Islamist ?third way.?</p>
<p>Yet almost immediately after voters returned the AKP to power in 2007 with another parliamentary majority, Erdogan?s political strategy shifted. Consensus was out and confrontation was in. Erdogan was likely never a democrat, but the context in which the change came is important. In June 2007, the Turkish General Staff sought to prevent Abdullah Gul?who had been foreign minister from 2003 to 2007?from becoming president. The following summer the Constitutional Court found that the AKP was at the center of anti-secular activity, but was one vote short of closing the party. Erdogan, who had served jail time in the late 1990s for allegedly inciting religious hatred, was the product of an Islamist movement whose political parties had been routinely banned and closed since the 1970s. Deeply paranoid?as many good politicians are?and then some because of his past experiences, Erdogan pressed his political advantage to keep his opponents on the defensive.</p>
<p>The AKP?s victories were now mandates to govern with little consideration of the still-large numbers of Turks who disagreed with the party and its leaders. The party won again in 2011 with its high watermark of almost, but not quite, 50 percent of the vote, proving that there were political benefits to a confrontational and divisive approach to politics. Erdogan and his party governed half the country that supported him and sought to intimidate the other half into silently accepting the AKP?s vision for Turkish society. When people refused to be silent, they were called marginal, terrorists, and not authentically Turkish. They were also fired from jobs and even arrested. Under these circumstances it is hardly surprising that a Pew Research Center poll conducted last spring found that Turks were evenly divided between the 49 percent who are ?satisfied that Turkey?s democracy is working? and the 49 percent who believe otherwise.</p>
<p>The result of Erdogan?s retreat to majoritarianism and populism is not just the ?polarization? that has been repeated ad infinitum over the last few weeks. The term actually tells us little about the <a href="" type="internal">multiple conflicts</a> roiling Turkish society, much of which can be traced to politicians seeking to benefit from them. The most dangerous of them is, of course, the conflict with the Kurdistan Workers? Party (PKK), which has once again become a hot war. The tragedy is that the AKP was best positioned to resolve what is euphemistically referred to as the ?Kurdish question.? The party?s emphasis on development and worldview, which de-emphasized the ethnic component of Turkish identity in favor of religious solidarity, held out hope that Turks and Kurds could accommodate each other in Anatolia. Erdogan tried to do so with a <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/money-vs-unrest-turkey-beefs-up-investment-in-kurdish-regions-a-555984.html" type="external">massive investment package</a> in the Kurdish southeast in 2005, by undertaking a ?Kurdish opening? in 2008 and 2009, and by launching a peace process with the PKK in 2013.</p>
<p>All of these initiatives failed, but it was the only the latter that Erdogan himself undermined. He no doubt had help from the PKK leadership that was negotiating with guns under the table and that had lost interest in the talks, but the Turkish president bears responsibility for creating an environment that made the new round of violence possible. In the past year and more, Erdogan tacked hard to the nationalist, anti-Kurdish right after the local elections in late March 2014; he sat on the sidelines as the self-proclaimed Islamic State pounded Syrian Kurds in Kobani, enraging their Turkish cousins; and he sought to link the HDP with the terrorism of the PKK after it became clear that the HDP had a genuine chance to break Turkey?s 10 percent parliamentary threshold, thereby denying the AKP a fourth majority in the Grand National Assembly. The result is the opposite of what the AKP, whose constituency of religious Kurds has disappeared, hoped to achieve when they came to power in 2002. Instead of peace, parts of Turkey?s southeast look like the war zones of the late 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<p>If Erdogan has pursued polarization as a political strategy and renewed warfare with the Kurds is one of the consequence, then so is the return of the military. I am not suggesting that a coup is in the offing. The military does not seem inclined to take on the responsibility, and there seems to be little interest among Turks for the officers to intervene. According to last spring?s Pew poll, 56 percent of Turks believe that democracy ?is the best way to solve their country?s problems,? but that is down from 68 percent in 2012, and the number of people who say that a strong leader is preferable to democracy is growing. Among those who hold this view, almost two-thirds are AKP supporters, which means that the strong leader they want is Erdogan and not General Hulusi Akar, the chief of staff of the armed forces. That said, the Pew Research Center also found that 52 percent of Turks regard the armed forces as the most trusted national institution. That has got to be a historic low, but against the backdrop of social tensions, economic troubles, terrorism, war, and Kurdish political gains in Iraq, Syria, and Turkey, it may help pave the way for the return of the Turkish General Staff as an actual political player. In the past, the officer corps justified their routine intervention in politics in part on the military?s popularity. I can hear my fellow Turkey analysts groaning. I have no idea how many times I have heard the refrain ?the era of coups is over,? but I am not suggesting that the Turkish General Staff is going to surround the&amp;#160;Ak Saray?the White Palace?with tanks and troops. Rather, as violence continues and the military takes on greater responsibilities and a more public role, political paralysis sets in, and the economy slides, the officers may find that the current environment is a propitious opportunity to assert themselves once again. If this does not sound like the 1990s, I don?t know what does.</p>
<p>The outcome of the elections is irrelevant to the larger story in Turkey, which is how familiar the violence, tawdry politics, and economic uncertainty all feel. This is the astonishing irony of the AKP era. The president?s political needs in the service of personal and national ambition have actually brought Turkey full circle. Erdogan is a towering figure in comparison to Turkey?s 1990s-era political leaders?with the exception of Turgut Ozal, who died in 1993?but for all of his talents and all the changes he has wrought, it is hard to overlook the fact that, in important ways, Erdogan?s Turkey today looks like the country he inherited when he first became prime minister in March 2003.</p>

<p>The Middle East is not actually different from other regions of the world with the exception of Europe. Most transitions do not succeed. Their failures can radicalize politics and, historically, authoritarianism, not democracy, has been the norm across the world. Yet this kind of macro-level comparison only reveals so much. Beyond establishing that the Middle East is not exceptional, it does not tell observers why democratic change was thwarted and violence both within and in some cases between societies has become so widespread. The failures in Iraq?authored by both Iraqis and Americans?have certainly had an impact on the region. Syria?s conflict is a vortex pulling in fighters, proxies, money, and weapons while spinning out violence within and beyond.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hahellyer.com/about/" type="external">H. A. Hellyer</a> contributed this guest post on the recent Egyptian parliamentary elections. I hope you find it interesting.</p>
<p>Egyptians voted this week for the eighth time in four years?ten if you count runoffs. The most blatant characteristic this time appears to be rather unedifying: An abundant lack of interest in the formal exercise of the democratic process. Unlike the enthusiasm of the last parliamentary elections in 2011, generalized apathy marked this round of voting. Yet there are some issues of intrigue to be drawn out and looked at further.</p>
<p>Nathan Brown, in a characteristically well-argued <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/10/13/why-egypts-new-parliament-will-be-born-broken/" type="external">piece</a> in the Washington Post, argues that ?Egypt?s parliament may be born broken,? a result of ?a combination of ad hoc decision-making, historical inertia and absent-mindedness?. There is little to dispute in that regard. I would emphasize that the policies of the current political dispensation in Cairo over the past two years have contributed tremendously to a background environment that makes it difficult to expect anything but a lackluster and fragmented parliament. Beyond indirect methods, very specific measures exist as well, which Brown goes into in considerable detail, particularly when it comes to the Egyptian ?war on terror? that has allowed for a great amount of repression in an astonishing amount of time, which different human rights organizations like the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights and the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies have examined in a great detail. Beyond that, there are a few items that might be queried further.</p>
<p>The first relates to the turnout, which unofficial reports suggest to be 20 to 25 percent, but could actually be much lower. It is clearly not expected to be particularly high. In 2011 the overall turnout was 54 percent?at that time the envy of many a parliamentary vote in many different countries. The vote was not entirely built on democratic rules in that a lot of bribery and unethical campaigning practices were widely reported, but it was a competitive and open process.</p>
<p>In 2015 few expected the turnout to reach even half of that amount; rather, it is heading toward closer to a third of that of the 2011 turnout, or less. In the 2014 presidential elections authorities panicked when voter turnout was low, first denying what was happening before undertaking a massive effort to increase participation, including the addition of a third day to vote. Yet in the current elections, authorities were seemingly content to allow that kind of low turnout. Why? Surely low turnout tarnishes the Egyptian leadership?s effort to portray the country as firmly on the path of democracy after the suspension of the democratic process in 2013. The presidency encouraged people to vote in a televised message the day before voting was to start, but he could hardly be expected to do otherwise. State media and pro-state media outlets encouraged people to vote, but the way in which the pleas went, it seems the outlets were more interested in backing the road map imposed by the military in 2013 rather than voting for a more developed democratic dispensation per se.</p>
<p>Those outlets weren?t alone in that regard. The electoral law implemented by the executive, which privileges independent candidates as opposed to benefiting party lists, does not encourage the strengthening of political parties as institutions in the country. Rather, it emboldens the preponderance of the following forces, which will often overlap: Proponents of big business interests; representatives of the same rural and urban networks that underpinned Mubarak?s National Democratic Party; and hard-core (as opposed to less staunch) supporters of the current presidency of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Those are hardly likely to push forward reform agendas, but their victories would simply mean a parliament is in place and the road map has generally been completed. Given that backdrop, it is perhaps unsurprising that Cairo thus far has not exhibited the same signs of panic over a low turnout as it did over previous polls in 2014, such as extending voting by a day.</p>
<p>Does the low turnout not bring the parliamentary vote into disrepute and then challenge the legitimacy of the political dispensation in Cairo today? That would appear to be dubious. Internationally, Cairo?s legitimacy is not simply a de facto fait accompli. Cairo has succeeded in becoming accepted thoroughly on the international stage. Sisi has spoken at the United Nations twice; Egypt now has a nonpermanent seat at the United Nations Security Council; and European leaders have visited Egypt, just as Sisi has gone to several European capitals (and is due to visit London in November). Cairo?s political legitimacy is not an issue with which it seems concerned, whether internationally or domestically. Cairo?s rather abysmal human rights record notwithstanding, Egypt is not a pariah state, but has seen the international community accept it. It does not need a big turnout in parliamentary elections to push forward on that score.</p>
<p>On the contrary, there is the argument that a low turnout actually works to Cairo?s interest. Obviously, in any healthy democracy, turnout ought to be high in order to establish a level of popular legitimacy for any representative body that should be able to challenge and hold to account the executive. Egypt is not a healthy democracy, however, and the presidency has indicated on a number of occasions that it views parliament as potentially possessing powers that it ought not to be exercised, especially in a time of ?crisis,? such as the current ?war on terror.? A low turnout may actually allow Egyptian officials to argue that the public is far more supportive of their president than parliament, lending greater legitimacy to the executive?s exercise of often-arbitrary powers. The level of fragmentation that is likely to ensue in parliament will certainly lend credence to that argument.</p>
<p>There is another aspect to be considered about this parliamentary election and that is the not-so-wild-card of the Salafist Nour Party. In 2011, it managed to acquire 30 percent of the parliamentary seats, successfully converting the social capital it had built up in Egypt over decades into political capital for the elections. Few expect that sort of dazzling outcome to be repeated. First, apathy will affect Nour Party supporters as much as it will anyone else. Second, many of those who previously supported the Nour Party will undoubtedly have drifted away after general disappointment with its record in the short-lived 2012 parliament and in politics over the last few years. Third, the Salafi base that the Nour Party appeals to is split between those who back the presidency and the executive more generally and those who are sympathetic to or support the Muslim Brotherhood?s Mohammed Morsi and his reinstatement to the presidency. All this said, it is difficult to assess the overall support base for the Nour Party. The electoral legal dynamics do not quite allow for that. Back in early 2011 the base for Salafi political support was around 5 percent, according to Gallup polls and was converted to a voting base of 30 percent by the end of the year. It was difficult to ascertain who was voting for Nour in 2011; it is now even more difficult to drill deep down to determine precisely who their supporters are.</p>
<p>Beyond the Nour Party, what is to become of the smaller, more leftist, relatively more liberal (though not quite, and Amr Hamzawy?s <a href="http://cddrl.fsi.stanford.edu/arabreform/news/ard-welcomes-amr-hamzawy-visiting-scholar" type="external">project</a> at Stanford promises to look at the illiberalism of most Egyptian non-Islamist forces) parties, such as the Egyptian Social Democrat Party (ESDP) and the Constitution Party? The latter has essentially imploded, and many of their members have departed for the former. The ESDP ran their candidates as independents, but their financial backing, compared to parties like the Free Egyptians Party, for example, is paltry. Privately, the ESDP expects single digit success in terms of seats. If they manage to get at least four or five seats they will be insignificant in terms of the parliament itself, but they will be able to build upon that in terms of developing the institution of the ESDP for the medium to the long term. If they do not, it could be an even rockier ride going forward.</p>
<p>Finally, what, if anything, is this parliament going to object to when it comes to the executive? There is little reason to believe that the legislature can be a genuine check or balance. When it comes to security sector reform, human rights issues, political improvements, judicial restructuring, and social justice none of these are likely to become an issue for the political forces in this parliament, and the presidency has few, if any, worries. The exception relates to the economic and financial files. On those issues there is a limited potential for the parliament to make its collective voice heard, if only as a nuisance, owing to the preponderance of big business interests in parliament. Even then, however, such objections will be unlikely to relate to social justice issues that pertain to economic reforms.</p>
<p>It is not that Egypt?s parliamentary elections are utterly bereft of intrigue. It?s that there is not much to be interested in, particularly when compared to the electoral races of 2011 and 2012.</p>

<p><a href="/politics-and-government/political-movements" type="external">Political Movements</a></p>
<p>In December 1987 the first&amp;#160;intifada&amp;#160;began after a traffic accident involving an Israeli truck and a Palestinian pedestrian outside the Jabaliya refugee camp set off a wave of demonstrations against Israel?s occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The sudden volleys of rocks pelting Israeli soldiers and the tear gas and rubber bullets in response changed the complexion of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians almost overnight, likely forever. The mighty Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) were not traversing the Sinai Peninsula in three days, rescuing hostages in Entebbe, or spending two daring minutes over Baghdad, but breaking teenagers? bones on the streets of Nablus, Hebron, Ramallah, and Gaza City. David had become Goliath and had no answer for Daoud?s slingshot. The Israelis must have been rattled by the images on television and pictures published in the press because, a few months after it all began, the Israeli consul general started doing the rounds of universities and colleges in the New York area to provide Jerusalem?s perspective on the unrest. I remember attending one such event on a chilly evening in a half-empty room at Vassar?s College Center. During the Q&amp;amp;A a member of the audience recalled an encounter with someone he identified as an ?Arab friend in Israel.? He alleged that during a debate over politics his friend relayed that, despite their relationship, he would kill him if and when communal violence erupted. It was an odd non sequitur to what had, until that moment, been an interesting discussion thankfully lacking the overwrought theatrics of more recent conversations about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on America?s campuses.</p>
<p>I bring all this up because the memory came rushing back to me last week when I watched the surveillance footage of a knife-wielding employee of the Israeli phone company,&amp;#160;Bezeq, hack a rabbi to death at a bus stop in Jerusalem. It was simply gruesome. There have been all kinds of arguments advanced for this sudden spate of violence, but it actually does not require any kind of deep explanation when the cause is so clear?Palestinian political and religious figures have directly and indirectly exhorted their people to kill Jews and a small number have obliged.</p>
<p>By all accounts daily life has become extraordinarily frightening for Israelis, especially since there does not seem to be an effective answer to random knife-wielding people bent on death. Can the Israelis cordon off East Jerusalem forever? What about Tel Aviv? The bus station in Afula? Do you surround Umm al-Fahm and not let people leave? What about Haifa with its large Palestinian population? It is a mind-boggling problem. The violence has, it seems, ushered a new ?psychotic??to use Bret Stephens?s <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/palestine-the-psychotic-stage-1444692875" type="external">description</a>?phase in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
<p>Stephens reserved ?psychotic? for Palestinians, but they have not cornered the market on blind hatred, dark interpretations of religion, and uncompromising ideologies. Israelis too have proven themselves capable of horrific, senseless violence lest anyone forget the names Ali Dawabsheh, Shira Banki, or Yitzhak Rabin for that matter. I can already picture my Twitter feed and email inbox filling up with accusations of ?moral equivalence.? By this, critics no doubt mean that I am willfully overlooking the fact that Palestinians leaders abet violence and Israeli officials do not or that I fail to recognize that Israeli violence is justified, but Palestinian bloodshed is not. My only answer is this: The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is always much more complicated than partisans on both sides would desperately like everyone to believe.</p>
<p>It is true that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has never implored Israelis to kill Palestinians and that he and members of his government denounced the murder of Dawabsheh. Of course, this comes after years of generalized passivity and tolerance?for political reasons?of the settlers and the extremists among them who have desecrated mosques, burned olive groves, and staged armed attacks on Palestinians. I should add that the perpetrators of these acts, like Rabin?s assassin, have often received&amp;#160;halachic&amp;#160;justification from settler rabbis. It is also true that the current round of Palestinian violence is based on a falsehood. Israel is not trying to alter the status quo on the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif. Yet there are apparently a growing number of Israelis who believe that a change in the delicate Israeli-Jordanian-Palestinian arrangements that govern Jerusalem?s holiest site is necessary to accommodate an increased Jewish presence there. And then there are those who want to ? <a href="http://www.templemountfaithful.org/objectives.php" type="external">liberate the Temple Mount from Arab (Islamic) occupation</a>.?</p>
<p>The Israeli authorities recognize the danger, but politics often has a way of producing outcomes that end up rewarding those who have little interest in peace. The settlers have won the internal Israeli debate over the status of the West Bank. They are never leaving. If I remember correctly, the last time there was an election in Palestine, Hamas won. No one would fairly describe either group as being in the peace camp. What we are seeing now in Israeli streets are the bloody results of a stalemate that empowers extremes. But here is the most depressing aspect of this current episode: All the incentives exist for a flagging Palestinian leadership to hitch their political fortunes to this violence, and on Israel cracking down, as the stabbing victims multiply, providing a pretext for Palestinians to escalate, leaving the Israelis no choice but to respond in kind. Maybe it will not happen in precisely this fashion, but it seems likely that Israelis and Palestinians are in for a prolonged period of violence. This should finally bury the fantasy of the two-state solution, but as Ari Shavit recently noted, it also shatters the equally unreal one-state solution of both the BDSers and Israel?s right, leaving everyone asking: And then what?</p>

<p></p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/20/shots-outside-us-embassy-in-turkey-after-russia-envoy-killed.html" type="external">CNBC</a> reported:</p>
<p>Turkish police on Tuesday detained a man who fired shots in front of the U.S. embassy in Ankara, several hours after the Russian ambassador to Turkey was killed in an attack across the street.</p>
<p>The man took out a pump-action shotgun he hid in his coat and fired around eight shots in the air before the embassy?s security guards intervened and apparently overpowered him, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency.</p>
<p>No one was hurt in the incident which occurred hours after a Turkish policeman, appearing to condemn Russia?s military role in Syria, fatally shot Russian Ambassador Andrei Karlov in front of a shocked gathering at a photo exhibit.</p>
<p>The embassy said its missions in Ankara, Istanbul and the southern city of Adana would be ?closed for normal operations on Tuesday.?</p>
<p>The U.S. embassy is located just across the street from the art exhibition center where the Russian ambassador was killed. It was not immediately known if the two incidents were connected.</p>

<article id="0000561" published-at="2014-02-18" title="White House: Employers Can Prevent Job Losses After Minimum Wage Hike by 'Accepting Lower Profit Margins'"><p>The White House lauded a Congressional Budget Office report on the proposed minimum wage hike to $10.10 per hour while brushing off one key finding: that such a bill could cost half a million jobs, and maybe more.</p>
<p>"The new Congressional Budget Office (CBO) <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44995" type="external">report</a> finds that 16.5 million workers would get a raise from increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour and this would help millions of hard-working families, reduce poverty, and increase the overall wages going to lower-income households," Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Betsey Stevenson, Council of Economic Advisers member, wrote in a White House blog post this afternoon.</p>
<p>"On employment, CBO?s central estimate is that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would lead to a 0.3 percent decrease in employment and CBO acknowledges that the employment impact could be essentially zero," they continued. "But even these estimates do not reflect the overall consensus view of economists which is that raising the minimum wage has little or no negative effect on employment. For example, seven Nobel Prize winners and more than 600 other economists recently stated that: 'In recent years there have been important developments in the academic literature on the effect of increases in the minimum wage on employment, with the weight of evidence now showing that increases in the minimum wage have had little or no negative effect on the employment of minimum-wage workers, even during times of weakness in the labor market.'"</p>
<p>The CBO report says that "once fully implemented in the second half of 2016, the $10.10 option would reduce total employment by about 500,000 workers, or 0.3 percent, CBO projects."</p>
<p>"As with any such estimates, however, the actual losses could be smaller or larger; in CBO?s assessment, there is about a two-thirds chance that the effect would be in the range between a very slight reduction in employment and a reduction in employment of 1.0 million workers," the report adds.</p>
<p><a href="" type="internal"></a></p>
<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>The report also found that the maximum impact from a minimum wage hike would not be felt by families below the poverty line.</p>
<p>"The increased earnings for low-wage workers resulting from the higher minimum wage would total $31 billion, by CBO?s estimate. However, those earnings would not go only to low-income families, because many low-wage workers are not members of low-income families. Just 19 percent of the $31 billion would accrue to families with earnings below the poverty threshold, whereas 29 percent would accrue to families earning more than three times the poverty threshold, CBO estimates," the report states.</p>
<p>"Once the increases and decreases in income for all workers are taken into account, overall real income would rise by $2 billion. Real income would increase, on net, by $5 billion for families whose income will be below the poverty threshold under current law, boosting their average family income by about 3 percent and moving about 900,000 people, on net, above the poverty threshold (out of the roughly 45 million people who are projected to be below that threshold under current law)."</p>
<p>"Opponents claim raising the minimum wage won?t reduce poverty, but that is not the case, as many American who work full time are unable to make ends meet. This finding echoes the broad consensus of academic studies on the topic, which is nearly unanimous in finding that increases in the minimum wage reduce poverty," Furman and Stevenson wrote for the White House.</p>
<p>"Overall the logic for the finding that raising the minimum wage does not result in large adverse impacts on employment is that paying workers a better wage can improve productivity and thereby reduce unit labor costs. These adjustments, along with others that firms can make, help explain why the increase in the minimum wage need not lead to a reduction in employment. Higher wages lead to lower turnover, reducing the amount employers must spend recruiting and training new employees. Paying workers more can also improve motivation, morale, focus, and health, all of which can make workers more productive. In addition, by reducing absenteeism, higher wages can increase the productivity of coworkers who depend on each other or work in teams. In addition, businesses can adjust in other ways rather than reducing employment (for example, by accepting lower profit margins). CBO?s estimates do not appear to fully reflect the increased emphasis on all of these factors from the recent economics literature."</p></article>
<article id="0000584" published-at="2014-08-30" title="Color the Opposing Team?s Locker Pink and ? Risk a Lawsuit?"><p>An article at <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/08/29/professors-robots-protest-u-iowas-pink-locker-room" type="external">Inside Higher Ed</a> highlights (no, not in hot pink) a ? ?controversy? at the University of Iowa: the opposing team?s (football) locker room is painted pink.</p>
<p>Controversy? Why?</p>
<p>Well, this is the Age of Political Correctness, especially on college campuses:</p>
<p>While it remains a beloved bit of visual smack-talk for many Hawkeye fans ? and was even featured in a recent ESPN ad about college traditions ? some students and faculty have decried the color scheme as sexist and discriminatory.</p>
<p>?There is no denying that [former Iowa football coach Hayden] Fry?s tactic is rooted in an antiquated age when homophobic and sexist epithets were the norm in sports,? [protester Kembrew] McLeod said.</p>
<p>Since 2005 Jill Gaulding, a former University of Iowa law professor, has threatened to sue or file a federal complaint against the university under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the law that forbids gender discrimination at colleges. On Thursday, Gaulding, who is now a lawyer with the nonprofit law firm Gender Justice, said the ?discussions are still ongoing,? and that the locker room?s color is a type of gender slur.</p>
<p>?It sends the message that anything associated with female is lesser-than,? Gaulding said. ?The minute I read about the pink locker room and how the university had built it even pinker, it felt like somebody had just reached out and slapped me across the face. It was that insulting. People know what it means.?</p>
<p>Erin Buzuvis, director of the Center for Gender &amp;amp; Sexuality Studies at Western New England University (uh oh), agrees with Gaulding that the locker room is a Title IX violation, but says a lawsuit victory would be tough. Still, she notes (my emphasis)</p>
<p>?Title IX?s application to athletics is aimed at equalizing the treatment of female athletes as well as their opportunities to play,? Buzuvis said. ?If you accept that using pink in the visitors? locker room operates a symbolic gesture of emasculation towards the team?s opponents, the pink locker room certainly represents a form of unequal treatment, since the symbolism trades on pink?s association with women and stereotypes about women?s inferior athleticism.?</p>
<p>But ? is that a stereotype? In general and taken as a whole, are not men ? superior athletes?</p>
<p>Before you go off with steam coming out of your ears, consider:</p>
<p>The mean difference has been about 10 percent between men and women for all (Olympic) events. The mean gap is 10.7 percent for running, 8.9 percent for swimming and 17.5 percent for jumping. ( <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/347443-athletic-differences-between-men-women/" type="external">Source</a>)</p>
<p>Men golfers hit the ball farther, in some cases a lot farther. Men tennis players hit the ball harder and faster. Baseball players throw faster and hit the ball farther than (women) softball players. Etcetera, etcetera. Why do we have separate sports leagues for the sexes, after all?</p>
<p>Men?s sports are far more popular with spectators because the competition level is greater. The athletes are faster, stronger, and more durable. This is just a biological fact, despite <a href="http://www.dailyiowan.com/2014/05/12/Opinions/37908.html" type="external">U. of Iowa?s student newspaper?s complaint</a> that the ?sexist norm of male superiority? still exists, and despite those who believe gender <a href="https://www.boundless.com/sociology/textbooks/boundless-sociology-textbook/gender-stratification-and-inequality-11/gender-and-socialization-86/the-social-construction-of-gender-496-8675/" type="external">is merely a ?social construction.?</a></p>
<p>By the way, there?s actually some psychological research to back up what the Iowa football squad (and others) have done to opponents? locker rooms. One researcher says the color pink acts like ?a tranquilizer that ?saps your energy.'? Pink is also used frequently in ?drunk tanks? and jail cells. In addition, the notion that pink is a ?girl?s color? is actually relatively new; it didn?t really begin to take hold until the 1940s.</p>
<p>In closing, I get that efforts to encourage male athletes (and coaches) to cease using terms like ?sissy? and anti-gay expressions need to be established and enforced. But over-zealous complaints about things like using pink in locker rooms ? because it facetiously calls into question opposing players? toughness, and even their masculinity ? are just another example of institutions like a ?Center for Gender &amp;amp; Sexuality Studies? finding ?reasons? to justify their existence.</p>

<article id="0000599" published-at="2016-09-25" title="'New York Times' Endorses Hillary, Calls Her 'Realist,' 'Bipartisan'"><p>On Saturday,&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/25/opinion/sunday/hillary-clinton-for-president.html?smid=tw-bna&amp;amp;_r=0" type="external">the New York Times</a>, lamentably America's newspaper of record, endorsed a corrupt, perfidious miscreant for president of the United States, and it wasn't Donald Trump. Alas, the paper elevated the scandal-ridden former secretary of State who barely scraped by in a race against&amp;#160;a 74-year-old self-avowed socialist, with the party cheating on her behalf!</p>
<p>Worse, the editorial board described Hillary Clinton as "realist" and "bipartisan." They attempted to make her palatable to young people by calling her a "grown-up." They praised her for only flip-flopping to their position. They dismissed her email scandal as "a matter for the help desk."&amp;#160;No, I am not making this up.</p>
<p>One wonders just what world the&amp;#160;Times has been living in for the past year. Overlooking Clinton's designation of "Republicans" as her enemy and the millions of Americans she would put in a "basket of deplorables," the&amp;#160;Times confidently declared that "she has shown an unusual capacity to reach across the aisle." As a U.S. senator and former secretary of State, "she built a reputation for grit and bipartisan collaboration," and as president, she would likely "find common ground with a destabilized Republican Party, whose unifying goal in Congress would be to discredit her."</p>
<p>Are we talking about the same person?</p>
<p>I would think not, especially since the paper also called the Democratic nominee "a realist who believes America cannot simply withdraw behind oceans and walls." Oh, she believes that America should be involved overseas, all right ? that much is not in doubt. It's the "realist" bit some might have a quibble with. This "realist" also thinks we can provide "free college" by taxing the rich. This "realist" thought that toppling a Libyan dictator in the name of democracy was a good idea. Sure, she isn't promising to make Mexico pay for a wall on the southern border, but nobody's perfect.</p>
<p>Perhaps Clinton actually is a realist, though. She understands that foreigners will only donate huge sums to the Clinton Foundation and <a href="" type="internal">pay her husband</a> absurdly high speaking fees if she <a href="" type="internal">grants them political favors</a>. Interestingly, neither the Foundation nor Hillary Clinton's infamous speeches to Wall Street firms merited a mention in the&amp;#160;Times' endorsement. Imagine that.</p>
<p>At least Clinton is a "grown-up." At age 68, I would hope so. But the&amp;#160;Times counts this as a key selling point ? for millennial outreach. "Through war and recession, Americans born since 9/11 have had to grow up fast, and they deserve a grown-up president," the&amp;#160;Times explained. Yes, Hillary's a grown-up, and that totally convinces the disenfranchised Bernie Sanders supporters to line up behind her. Brilliant move,&amp;#160;New York Times!</p>
<p>Another count in Clinton's favor, according to the&amp;#160;Times, is that she's flip-flopped ? to their position.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Yes, driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants is&amp;#160;the right position (given from the mouth of God Himself),&amp;#160;and it doesn't matter that Clinton flip-flopped, because at least her heart's in the right place. One wonders if the&amp;#160;Times has a similar position on Clinton's gay-marriage reversal ? is it suddenly acceptable she once opposed it because she's arrived at "the right position" now?&amp;#160;On other key flip-flops, the&amp;#160;Times is similarly forgiving, if not outright sycophantic:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Um, sure. The newspaper praised Clinton for supporting the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and assured readers that "her underlying commitment to bolstering trade ... is not in doubt." But I thought the whole reason she flip-flopped on TPP was to make her commitment to free trade&amp;#160;more in doubt. Was I wrong?</p>

<article id="0000609" published-at="2004-01-12" title="The Decline And Fall Of The American Job / VIEW FROM THE LEFT"><p>It all started with Joe, any old Joe.</p>
<p>Joe was a decent fellow, a businessman, a good citizen, a wonderful neighbor. But he was having a hard time making a profit. Oh, sure, he was worth a few million, but he could have been worth a lot more if labor costs weren't so high. And those unions!</p>
<p>So, one day, Joe got a bright idea. "Those people in Arkansas and Tennessee and South Carolina will work for a lot less than my employees," he thought, "so why don't I move my business down there?"</p>
<p>And that's what he did. Good-bye, Detroit, hello, Charlotte. Sure, he offered to take his employees with him when he moved, but they'd have to agree to work for half their former wages. None went.</p>
<p>About the same time Joe made his move, Geno began to wonder why he was freezing his butt off in Duluth and paying big bucks to ship his frozen foods all over the country. "I could save big transportation bucks if I moved my operation to Ohio," Geno thought, and so he did. Duluth wept. The folks there had lost a folk hero, and the town's best employer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the iron-mining companies pried the very last shred of iron ore out of the ground in northern Minnesota, so they left with an eye on Venezuela, which hadn't been raped yet.</p>
<p>The iron-mining companies were following the fine example set by the logging companies, which around the turn of the 20th century chopped down every virgin pine in Minnesota and then left.</p>
<p>Now those companies are chopping down Northern California, Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in Detroit, Joe's competitors were envious. And they were hurting. Not only was Joe raking in the big profits Down South, but he left behind a bunch of unemployed people who couldn't afford to buy anything anymore.</p>
<p>They hated to do it, but Joe's competitors finally caved in and joined Joe in the land of mint juleps, no unions and low wages. It was around that time that people started calling the northeastern part of the United States the Rust Belt.</p>
<p>The arrival of his competitors in the "right to work" states made Joe a little uneasy. It wouldn't be long before they'd be able to compete with him again, and even though he was now a multimillionaire many times over, he wanted to see just how big a fortune he could rack up before he died.</p>
<p>Joe made a little economic progress when he learned that people who snuck into the United States from Mexico would work for even less than the Southerners he was exploiting, so he canned his American crews and replaced them with people with Hispanic surnames. Then, in 1986, President <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Ronald+Reagan%22" type="external">Ronald Reagan</a> signed an amnesty for Mexicans living illegally in the United States, thus encouraging other Mexicans to flood across the border. In his signing message, Reagan said that from now on, employers who hired illegal immigrants would be held accountable. They'd go to jail. (Wink, wink.)</p>
<p>Joe and his fellow entrepreneurs had a good laugh over that one, and he learned Spanish. And, on one of his trips to Mexico, Joe learned that Mexicans working in Mexico are paid a lot less than Mexicans working in the United States, so he did what comes naturally: He moved his manufacturing plants to Mexico.</p>
<p>And so it went, with Joe and all his competitors and men and women in other businesses. The grass really was greener on the other side of the border, and it proved to be greener yet on the other side of the ocean.</p>
<p>American jobs moved south, then further south, then all over the planet. The hot spot now is Communist China, which specializes in slave labor. We abhor that, of course, but what can we do? If we don't send our jobs there, our competitors certainly will, and where will we be then?</p>
<p>Out of business, that's where.</p>
<p>The big downside to all this is that we're destroying customers. Every job lost in the United States is a customer lost. Every job lost is a taxpayer lost and a tax burden gained. The pioneers in the outsourcing movement thought they were smart, and perhaps they were. Their competitors did what they had to do to survive.</p>
<p>But where will it all end? Will it be good for America when all the industry is somewhere else?</p>
<p>Governments can influence what happens. Conservatives say they don't like big government, and liberals nod in agreement, but big government in India is what's moving a lot of our high-tech jobs there.</p>
<p>India, thanks to government sponsorship, has the best technical institutes in the world. They admit only the best of the best, about 2 percent of applicants. Their standards are higher than <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Ivy+League%22" type="external">Ivy League</a> standards. And they have no room for slackers.</p>
<p>The result? India's high-tech people are sought after by American businesses, and we're shipping high-tech jobs to India at a breathtaking pace.</p>
<p>Most of you are too young to remember this, but the phrase "Made in Japan" used to be another way to say "junk." Japan had a reputation of producing everything out of used American beer cans.</p>
<p>That all changed in 1959, when the Japanese government told its manufacturers that, henceforth, everything shipped from Japan had to be of high quality. <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Toyota%22" type="external">Toyota</a> and Sony and all the rest had no choice but to comply, and now "Made in Japan" means dependable quality.</p>
<p>In America, our efficiency might spell our doom. Not only are we outsourcing production to the lowest bidder, but we've done a pretty good job of dumbing down all the jobs so that any low-paid worker can perform them. And we've automated to a maddening degree, which becomes obvious when you call just about any company with the hope of talking to a real person.</p>
<p>(Getting rid of switchboard operators in favor of an annoying automated system seems rather dumb until you realize how much money can be saved by not employing a team of round-the-clock operators.)</p>
<p>And the Wal-Martization of America continues apace, with our choices of retailers, grocers, banks, gas stations -- just about everything -- getting smaller and smaller.</p>
<p>I don't know what we or our government can do to reverse the movement of the United States toward Third World status. In Washington, it's all about money. The <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Republicans%22" type="external">Republicans</a> have always been the party of big business and money, and now the <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Democrats%22" type="external">Democrats</a> have joined them. The corporations are wonderfully represented, the people much less so.</p>
<p>What to do? It's fairly easy to see what's happening, but extremely difficult to know what to do about it.</p></article>
<article id="0000611" published-at="2013-11-25" title="The Deal With Iran: A Turning Point, Yes, But Toward What?"><p>As the powers negotiated in Geneva, and as the Israelis and Saudis hissed warnings from the sidelines, flame wars burst out among the chatterati over the nuclear agreement with Iran. Some on our Twitter feed say that the interim nuclear deal with Iran is the greatest thing since sliced bread. Others think it?s the biggest act of appeasement since Hitler snatched the Sudetenland from the palsied hands of Chamberlain and Daladier. Appeaser! Warmonger! The epithets are flying through the ether, and the Great Iran Bunfight is on.</p>
<p>Here at VM, color us unimpressed, both by the agreement and by much of the commentary around it. On the one hand, while we don?t rule out a miracle, the chances are stacked against the interim deal producing a final settlement of the Iran nuclear issue. The White House would greatly prefer that nobody think about this for a while, but nuclear deals with countries whose leaders actually want nuclear weapons tend to flop. American negotiators have a long and virtually unbroken record in such cases of bringing home carefully worded agreements, hammered out in difficult meetings?that somehow don?t stop the onward march of nukes.</p>
<p>North Korea?s road to the bomb was and still is paved with interim agreements and negotiating breakthroughs. None of those deals stopped the Norks? progress toward a small family of bombs, though various American administrations and Secretaries of State were able to bask in the glow (of the agreements, not of the bombs) and get a few friendly headlines. For that matter, American Presidents in days of yore thought that they had reached understandings with Israel and Pakistan. They were wrong.</p>
<p>Given that history, our first instinct isn?t to break out the champagne when we hear of a nuclear deal with Iran. But we?re also less than convinced by some of the expert analyses that various commentators have produced to show why the deal is or isn?t a good one. The internet today is packed with arm chair disarmament ?experts? who?ve never visited a nuclear power plant much less a bomb factory and they are ready, willing and, sort of, able to provide instant responses to a deal most of them know very little about.</p>
<p>Having visited a nuclear power plant back in our freshman days at Pundit High and having read a great many newspaper articles on the subject in subsequent years, we are by internet standards a formidable expert on all matters nuclear. But even so we hesitate to pronounce on the effectiveness of the constraints on Iran?s nuclear activities outlined in the interim agreement. &amp;#160;Despite Mr. Snowden?s best efforts from Moscow, we don?t know what the world?s leading intelligence agencies think about the Iranian nuclear program, how the fine print in this agreement will affect the decisive elements of the Iranian program, and how confident the real experts are that Iran?s compliance can be monitored. We also don?t know what the intentions of Iran?s Supreme Leader and Guide are, and so we are going to have to wait and see what?s going on.</p>
<p>Think of us as skeptical but not close-minded as we wait for more light. It remains the case that we vastly prefer a real agreement with Iran to any of the available alternatives, but we are far from certain that a real understanding has been reached.</p>
<p>The agitated controversy over the fine print in the interim agreement is to some degree a red herring. The fate of this deal (like all deals) and of U.S.-Iran relations more generally is tied less to the specific language of the agreement than to the political intentions of the various parties of the accord and to the broader context of their relationship. And this is where the hard questions appear. If we aren?t sure yet about the specific structure and content of the nuke deal, there is much about the context of the deal that gives us pause. Iran looks more like a country on a roll than a country backed into a corner; while sanctions have undoubtedly put severe pressure on the economy, nothing has stopped Iran?s effective promotion of its clients in Syria and Lebanon, and arguably in Iraq as well.</p>
<p>Increasingly as we look around the world we see key actors, both allies and adversaries of the United States, beginning to act as if the United States is losing the interest and the capacity to act in their regions. Worse, we see signs that, with the noblest of intentions, the Obama Administration is in a kind of headlong retreat from the kind of global engagement that, in our view, offers the best hope for peace.</p>
<p>A group of countries is beginning to mount what is developing into an organized campaign against the present world orderA group of countries is beginning to mount what is developing into an organized campaign against the present world order, and especially against the controlling position the United States has had in Eurasia since the end of the Cold War. China is pushing against the territorial status quo from the mountain passes of Andhra Pradesh to the rocky islets of the East and South China seas. Russia pursues the dream of a Eurasian Union that would revive Moscow?s control across former Soviet territory. Iran seeks to remake the Middle East in its image.</p>
<p>There are reasonable reasons why these countries have the ambitions they do. China feels itself to be a rising power and does not see why it should be bound by treaties written and boundaries drawn by colonial powers now vanished from the scene. Russia is not only nostalgic for lost power but faces a genuine dilemma. There are two great modern projects in Europe: NATO and the European Union. Russia has been excluded from both. The West offers Russia no path to a future; it can hardly object when Russia then looks to build one on its own. For Iran, there is also nostalgia?for a time when Persian culture and power played a decisive role from the Himalayas to the Nile. Given the political incompetence of the Arabs, say the Iranians, if Islam is ever to achieve respect, it must be Iran that bears the green banner high. The Saudis are a weak petro-state with a shady past and an uncertain future; Syria and Iraq are snake pits; Egypt is as dark as it was in the days of the Pharaohs. Only the Turks can hope to rival Iran, and the Turks, say the Iranians, are not what they were.</p>
<p>These ideas are not altogether foolish or malign, and the United States should think carefully about where and how the ambitions of eager powers can be accommodated, but the revisionist goals of China, Russia and Iran cannot be realized in anything like their full form without overturning the post-Cold War order of the world. This is exactly what the revisionist powers hope to do.</p>
<p>After many years of failure and frustration, two of the revisionist powers have enjoyed unexpected success in 2013. (China is still pushing, most recently with the <a href="" type="internal">new air defense restrictions</a> over the East China Sea, but so far it has, presumably to its frustration, had less success than the others at changing realities along its frontiers.)</p>
<p>Iran has been on a roll this year; even as the Sunni world broke up into angry rival blocs, Iran?s client Assad (with a major assist from Russia) has reversed the tide of civil war in Syria and now looks like a survivor. With President Obama?s threats of regime change and airstrikes converted into hesitant mumbles, a Russo-Iranian client has won the most significant diplomatic victory over the United States in decades.</p>
<p>Russia is also pressing ahead. Mr. Snowden?s dowry of intelligence information was a godsend not only to Russian operatives but for the renovated Russian propaganda machine. (Nuclear weapons, intelligence services and the ability to spread anti-American memes through the press are among Russia?s surviving legacies from the Soviet era; President Putin makes the most of what he?s got.) Last week it achieved a major victory in its Eurasian campaign; for now at least Ukraine will not sign an Association Agreement with the European Union, and Russia?s hopes to bring Ukraine into the Eurasian fold remain alive.</p>
<p>It may seem odd that China, in most ways the most formidable of the revisionist powers, has had so little success. The reason is simple: The United States under President Obama remains engaged in Asian geopolitics while it cares little for the ex-Soviet space and is more eager to exit the Middle East than to dampen its conflicts. Thus the United States was essentially silent during the discussion over whether Ukraine would accept European conditions in order to sign an Association Agreement with the European Union and, as is notoriously the case, the United States has done nothing about either Syria?s slide into sectarian hell or Iran?s unwavering support for the Assad regime.</p>
<p>This is the context, we fear, in which the Iranians and others in the region view the ?interim? nuclear deal. The Obama administration is dialing back American power and ambition everywhere in the world except for East Asia, and with the Arabs and Sunnis in disarray, that creates a juicy vacuum in what Iran hopes will become its sphere of influence. President Obama?s choice to allow President Assad to sell his chemical weapons in exchange for an implicit acceptance that he will continue to rule over the ruins of Damascus tells Tehran that the President is more interested in staying out of the Middle East than in doing anything with it or to it.</p>
<p>Tehran may well believe, and be correct, that President Obama is at this point less interested in stopping the Iranian nuclear program than in disentangling himself from the ugliness and chaos of a region that has brought him little joy. His efforts to support democracy in Egypt cratered. His Libyan adventure is increasingly an ugly mess. The Israelis and the Saudis hate him, and the Turks are no fun. It would not be surprising if President Obama at this point has come to believe that the Middle East policy that works best is the one that risks and does least.</p>
<p>The President isn?t, Iranians may think, ready just yet to concede on the nuclear question, but as time goes on he is gradually coming to terms with the prospect of an Iranian bomb. Tehran sees correctly that there is little public appetite in the United States for yet another Middle Eastern war, and it watched carefully as the President?s call for the use of force against Syria over chemical WMD collapsed ignominiously into bickering and retreat. Indeed, <a href="https://www.stljewishlight.com/news/world/article_6fd1daa7-152c-5065-a40d-671534872194.html" type="external">recent polling</a> shows that a majority of Americans are largely supportive of some kind of interim deal with Iran. Stringing these data points together, and noting how little effect Israel?s supporters have had in moving the American debate, seasoned observers in Tehran must now believe that time is on their side. By signing a temporary deal Iran can continue to consolidate its regional power, use the sanctions money to ease political pressure at home and gradually shift the Americans toward a fatalistic attitude toward what Iranian leaders must now feel is the increasingly inevitable development of an Iranian bomb.</p>
<p>GOP partisans are frothing with rage at what they see as lily-livered cowardice on the part of an appeasing Administration. We share some of their concerns about where the new Iran policy could lead, but it?s important to remember that both parties contributed to the current political mess. George W. Bush did not exactly give the use of force in the Middle East a good name or increase the public?s appetite for war there, and the political mood of withdrawal that helps shape President Obama?s thinking has roots in the Right as well as the Left.</p>
<p>Our position continues to be that a decent agreement with Iran is better than a war with Iran, and our doubts about the interim accord have less to do with its substance than with our concern that the administration?s Middle East stance may end up making war more rather than less likely. Critics of the administration?s Middle East policy would do well to look up from the fine print of the Geneva agreement and focus on the regional picture; watch this space for future posts on the regional prospects and on the politics of the revisionist alliance now looking for ways to reshape the geopolitics of Eurasia.</p></article>

<p>In a highly symbolic move, the European Union yesterday approved the first genetically modified seeds for planting and sale across E.U. territory, outraging greens and defying public opinion (70 percent of E.U. citizens oppose GM food). The European Commission approved 17 varieties of GM corn developed by U.S. biotech behemoth Monsanto, marking a decisive end to a de facto biotech ban that?s been in effect in the E.U. since 1998. Enviros expressed dismay that the commission did not issue E.U.-wide guidelines for keeping GM, conventional, and organic crops separated. ?[T]he widespread contamination of conventional crops is highly likely, posing a massive threat to Europe?s food, farming, and environment,? said Geert Ritsema of Friends of the Earth. In slightly happier news for Euro-greens, the commission abandoned an earlier plan to allow some percentage of GM seeds in food without labeling, unable to agree on a percentage after three years of debate. The decision will be passed to the next commission, which takes office in November.</p></article>

<p><a href="/diplomacy-and-international-institutions/sanctions" type="external">Sanctions</a></p>
<p><a href="http://explore.georgetown.edu/people/chav/" type="external">Victor D. Cha</a>, who served on the National Security Council staff in the Bush administration&amp;#160;and was on the team negotiating with North Korea, says UN Security Council sanctions leveled against North Korea after its last nuclear test in May have largely caused Pyongyang to shift to "smile diplomacy, now, as opposed to nuclear diplomacy and ballistic missile diplomacy a few months ago." He says there are signs that North Korea?s leader, Kim Jong-Il, is not as crippled as first reported months ago, but that a transition is in the works with his youngest son, Kim Jong-un, as his likely successor. Cha says some kind of <a href="" type="internal">Six-Party Talks</a> will resume, but there will also likely be important bilateral talks between North Korea and the United States.</p>
<p>Several months ago, relations between the West and North Korea seemed on ice after North Korea had missile tests in April and an underground nuclear explosion in May. And now, since the visit of former U.S. President Bill Clinton to Pyongyang in early August <a href="" type="internal">resulting in the release</a> of the two American journalists, there?s been a series of conciliatory sounding statements and steps by the North Koreans. What?s going on in North Korea?</p>
<p>The first thing we have to think about is what is causing the North to be more diplomatic, to be using smile diplomacy now as opposed to nuclear diplomacy and ballistic missile diplomacy a few months ago. It could be a variety of things, but if I had to point to one core causal factor, I would say it?s probably the impact of the UN sanctions.</p>
<p>The ones that were imposed in June?</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="" type="internal">Security Council Resolution 1874</a>. The provisions in the resolution were quite comprehensive. [They] included an arms embargo and the designation of North Korean individuals for censure, which went further than any other sanctions that the United States unilaterally, or the UN, has ever put on North Korea. I don?t think people fully appreciate how important those sanctions were, and in their implementation they?ve been fairly effective. We saw a ship that was headed to Myanmar going back to North Korea, and days ago the UAE [United Arab Emirates] seized a clandestine North Korean arms shipment destined for Iran. So UN member states are implementing this resolution. And the North Koreans realize this and know that these sorts of sanctions are unprecedented. And for this reason, they?re interested in a little bit of coming back to the table to see if they can get some of those sanctions loosened.</p>
<p>"This is a fundamental reform dilemma that [North Koreans] face. They need to open up to survive, but the process of opening up can lead to the collapse of the family?s rule."</p>
<p>Now the North Koreans--most recently Kim Jong-Il himself--keep saying that they want a peace treaty with the United States. The U.S. position has always been, "Let?s get rid of the nuclear issue and then we can talk about a peace treaty separately." Why do the North Koreans keep stressing the importance of a peace treaty?</p>
<p>In terms of the peace treaty idea, one argument for why they feel this is so important is that they?re a small insecure state after the end of the Cold War. They need their nuclear weapons for security and the peace treaty would help relieve some of those security concerns. There?s some truth to that argument, but at the same time, as we have found with North Korea in the past, signing a piece of paper is not going to get the North Koreans to give up all of their nuclear weapons. What they want is not so much physical security or the external security of the regime assured, because everybody knows that the United States is not going to attack North Korea. We have absolutely no interest in attacking North Korea. What they really want in terms of security is some sort of guarantee of security for the regime if they were to open up their society and give up their nuclear weapons. For a variety of reasons that kind of internal security is much harder for the United States to guarantee both politically and in terms of human rights.</p>
<p>Are they afraid as they open up and have more trade and outside investment in North Korea the regime will crumble from within? Do they fear a Velvet Revolution like the Iranians are afraid of?</p>
<p>That?s exactly right. This is what I <a href="" type="internal">wrote</a> in Foreign Affairs in 2002. This is a fundamental reform dilemma that they face. They need to open up to survive, but the process of opening up can lead to the collapse of the family?s rule. So, they talk about a peace treaty and security but what they really want is some sort of regime assurance, and that?s much harder for the United States to give. I had a research assistant actually go back and research the number of times since 1988 that a U.S. president or secretary of state or national security adviser has stated very clearly and publicly that the United States has no intention to attack or invade North Korea. She came back with fifteen single-spaced pages of citations. A peace treaty for them is just a piece of paper. It?s a good rhetorical device to use to try to shift the blame to the United States. But in the end, what they want is a different form of security, which is much harder for the free world to give them.</p>
<p>At the time of the nuclear explosion in May, there was speculation that this was part of a plan to set the stage for Kim Jong-un to take over. And then Kim Jong-Il shows up when Clinton arrives and hosts this dinner and is making all these statements. Is he still around and kicking?</p>
<p>Yes. He seems to be a lot better, physically, than a lot of people thought prior the Clinton trip based on the photos that were showing up in the press. Many people feel, after the Clinton trip, that although he clearly had a stroke, he?s recovered somewhat and he certainly doesn?t seem to be on his deathbed. He seems to be pretty much in control of things. This doesn?t mean, however, that a transition is not in preparation. The stroke was sudden and unexpected. And the leadership realized that they need to get ready. They are in the process of leadership transition but it may not be as rushed as we all thought.</p>
<p>Is the speculation about Kim Jong-un solid? No one?s seen him recently, have they?</p>
<p>"One of the things that Obama has done very well is that he got everybody to see the problem as being caused by North Korea and not the United States."</p>
<p>The speculation appears to be that he is the one. But I don?t think he would ever rule on his own. He would need a lot of help from his uncle, Chang Song-taek, who runs the secret police, and representatives from the party and from the military who really run the country. But he appears to be the one they?re looking to. In internal propaganda he?s now called something like the "Brilliant Comrade." Kim Il-sung was the Great Leader, and Kim Jong-Il is the Dear Leader.</p>
<p>These conciliatory steps towards South Korea--did that start with the high-level delegation coming to the funeral for Kim Dae-jung last month in Seoul?</p>
<p>The main driver of that change was the impact of the UN sanctions. If you look at the agreements that were reached by the chairman of the Hyundai Group, Hyun Jung-eun, when she was there [in North Korea] recently, they?re largely restarting a couple of tourism projects. The tourism projects are a huge hard currency benefit for North Korea. And if you think about it, tourism is the best sort of hard currency source because you pay a ticket to get in, see something, and you leave. It has no broader impact on the regime but gives the leadership hard currency.</p>
<p>The North Koreans certainly haven?t been very warm to President Barack Obama, have they?</p>
<p>No. And one of the things that Obama has done very well is that he got everybody to see the problem as being caused by North Korea and not the United States. By the end of the Bush administration, we were meeting North Korea in bilateral sessions all over the world. We met in Berlin, in Geneva, and we even went to Pyongyang. But at the same time there was still this very popular view that the United States refused to talk, and that the reason North Korea was doing all these things like abrogating the <a href="" type="internal">2007 agreement</a> to dismantle its nuclear program was because we weren?t engaging with them. The Obama administration turned that around overnight by simply saying, "We?re happy to push forward and meet with them at a high level and move forward via the Six-Party Talks." Then the North did these tests and just like that, everybody said, "Well, screw these guys," and that?s how we got such a strong UN Security Council resolution.</p>
<p>Do you think they?ll be back to the Six-Party Talks by the end of the year?</p>
<p>It?s hard to say. There will be some semblance of Six-Party Talks, in part because this administration and the region realizes that it?s the best way to hold North Korea to any agreements that it makes. But I don?t deny that there will be some important bilateral discussion.</p>

<p>&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Suzy Saroyan is a Syrian Armenian living in Aleppo.&amp;#160; She is an Agricultural Engineer. She was interviewed by Steven Sahiounie who is an American-Syrian journalist.</p>
<p>Steven:&amp;#160;From news reports we hear that the Armenian Church and community are being attacked, and have suffered deaths and destruction recently.&amp;#160; Can you tell us what you have seen?</p>
<p>Suzy: It is true that our church and community was recently attacked by the American backed rebels, who are actually terrorists and criminal mercenaries.&amp;#160; We have lost many Armenians in Aleppo recently, but I must remind you we have always been suffering and under attack from these Radical terrorists since Aleppo came under their attacks and infiltration 4 years ago.&amp;#160; This is not the first time, but only the most recent.</p>
<p>Steven: Can you tell us how many churches have come under stack by the rebels in Syria?</p>
<p>Suzy:&amp;#160;According to online sources, at least 63 churches have been totally destroyed by terrorists, and over 100 have been attacked.</p>
<p>Steven:&amp;#160; We know that in USA there are millions of Armenians, more than those in Syria.&amp;#160; I am thinking of places like Boston, Fresno and Glendale.&amp;#160; We know that many of those American Armenians are from Syrian roots.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; What is your opinion of the response of the American Armenian community to the suffering in Syria?</p>
<p>Suzy:&amp;#160; I see there is no response from the American Armenian community.&amp;#160; They certainly don?t show any solidarity with us here.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; I feel they have lost any connection with their brothers in the Middle East.&amp;#160; I read the Armenian media from the USA, and I see they are very focused on the Genocide recognition issue, the nation called Armenia, and the domestic Armenian community.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; When they mention Syria it is just a news article with facts given, but they never delve deeper into the ?Why? this is happening, or to offer a plan to stop the war in Syria.</p>
<p>Steven:&amp;#160; Do you feel the American Armenian community can do anything to stop the war in Syria?</p>
<p>Suzy:&amp;#160; The American Armenian community holds all the power to stop the war in Syria.&amp;#160; They are for the most part wealthy and protective taxpayers and voters.&amp;#160; American Armenians are model citizens.&amp;#160; By forming groups, or acting individually, they could contact their elected Congressional officials, who they put into office, and demand of them to stop all support of rebels in Syria.&amp;#160; These are the rebels who are raping, maiming and killing Syrian Armenians, Syrian Christians and Syrian Muslims.</p>
<p>Steven: Why do you think the American Armenians don?t do this?</p>
<p>Suzy: &amp;#160;When you live in USA you become Americanized.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; You believe that the US media is telling you the truth.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; You don?t want to face the fact that the US media is political propaganda, brainwashing you into believing the Syrian war is a civil war, or a sectarian war.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; The US media wants you to think that the Syrian war cannot be stopped by any outside influence.&amp;#160; They want you to think it is an internal problem, with no external component.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; This notion is completely false.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; It is the American backed rebels who are the problem.&amp;#160; They began as one group, The Syrian Free Army, and they are now dozens of groups, all aligned with Al Qaeda and at the same time supported and protected by USA.</p>
<p>Steven:&amp;#160; Are there any moderate rebels who don?t attack unarmed civilians, churches, schools or hospitals?&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Suzy:&amp;#160; No.&amp;#160; There are no moderate rebels inside Syria. Syria is home to 18 different religious sects. The Armenian community is just one of them. If the fight in Syria were a real revolution, then you would see militias formed from all the various sects in Syria, including the many Christian sects, just like we saw in the 25 year civil war in Lebanon.&amp;#160; However, you don?t have that situation in Syria. You have only 1 sect, the Wahhabi Muslim sect, who has formed numerous armed groups, which are aligned with Al Qaeda type terrorists. These various groups have the backing of USA and the financial support of Saudi Arabia, who is a Wahhabi Kingdom without any form of freedom or democracy.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Saudi Arabia is the ultimate so called Islamic State.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Steven:&amp;#160; Why does USA support a bloody revolution in Syria?</p>
<p>Suzy:&amp;#160; USA?s foreign policy on Syria is to achieve regime change at any cost.&amp;#160; They want to remove the current&amp;#160;&amp;#160; elected President Bashar al Assad and replace him with an American puppet government.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Remember what America did in Iraq, Egypt and Libya?&amp;#160; These were all classic regime change policies supported and carried out by America.&amp;#160; &amp;#160;Syria was to be the prize, but the Syrian people are resisting and fighting back to retain their own secular form of government.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Steven: The US media says the Syrian Arab Army is all Alowis, and Assad Loyalists.&amp;#160; Is that true?&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Suzy:&amp;#160; Is the US Army and Military all Obama Loyalists?&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Are they wearing a uniform and serving in distant lands under hardship because they worship President Obama?&amp;#160;&amp;#160; The American military would laugh in your face at such rubbish.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; The Syrian Arab Army (SAA) is made up of every healthy male over the age of 18 who is not enrolled in University.&amp;#160; This is a compulsory National service.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; These fighting men, and women, are from every religious and ethnic group in Syria, including Armenians.&amp;#160; They are fighting to defend Syria and their values and culture.&amp;#160; They are fighting to prevent the ISIS from taking control in Syria.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; While USA is supporting the terrorists who want to establish a so called Islamic State in Syria, such as Ahrar al Sham.&amp;#160; If this were to happen, all Christians in Syria would either be slaughtered, or have to leave as refugees, with no hope of return.&amp;#160; Syria is part of the Holy Land, from Bible days.&amp;#160; Damascus was a Christian capital, with churches and a Cathedral, while the Europeans were still worshiping stones and bonfires.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; We will never allow Christians to be wiped out of the Middle East and the Holy Lands.</p>
<p>Steven: Why do you think the American Christian community doesn?t voice their solidarity with Syrian Christians?</p>
<p>Suzy:&amp;#160; I think the American Christian community is only aware of themselves.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; They focus on their own church, their own family, and their own community.&amp;#160; They are very insulated and isolated.&amp;#160; They feel they are Americans first, before Christians.&amp;#160; They accept the US policy on Syria, or they will claim to not be aware of the US policy to destroy Syria.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; They like to hide behind ignorance.&amp;#160; If you confront them with the facts that the US government is supporting Radical terrorists they will assert that the American government is fighting terrorism.&amp;#160; If you try to explain it to them, they get offended and feel that it is unpatriotic to object to a US foreign policy.&amp;#160; They also claim they have no voice: no say in their government.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; They like to claim there is nothing they could do to change US policy.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &amp;#160;In the end, they accept all the massacres and atrocities committed in Syria by the US backed rebels, as collateral damage.</p>
<p>Steven: On March 21, 2014 there was an attack and massacre on the Syrian Armenian village at Kessab. Can you tell us what happened there?</p>
<p>Suzy:&amp;#160; Everyone was asleep in their own homes.&amp;#160; The Turkish military started the attack using helicopters and large canons to shoot at the police station in Kessab.&amp;#160; The Turkish military allowed the terrorists to easily cross the border into Kessab, from Turkey.&amp;#160; Without the Turkish military?s helicopters and canon, the attack could not have happened.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; The terrorists came house to house killing and attacking.&amp;#160; The able bodied residents took flight to Latakia in their cars.&amp;#160; However, there were 24 very elderly persons who were not able to move quickly, and were kidnapped and held captive by the terrorists.&amp;#160; The terrorists included the American backed Free Syrian Army, as well as other Al Qaeda linked terrorist groups, some of who were actually westerners, such as Australians.&amp;#160; This was evidenced by the letters they left behind.&amp;#160; They killed many persons that morning: it was a massacre, and they beheaded some.&amp;#160; They took the elderly captives to Turkey and held them against their will for 3 months of abuse, during which time 1 person died there.&amp;#160; On April 1, 2014 the American Ambassador to Turkey, Francis J. Riccardone, Jr arrived in Vikifly, Turkey to visit the kidnap victims.&amp;#160; He brought the well know translator Nezar Khalil with him.&amp;#160; The elderly captives begged for him to release them and send them to Latakia, to be reunited with relatives and neighbors there at the church.&amp;#160; He refused to help them, even though it was the American backed rebels, the FSA, who held them in Turkey.&amp;#160; On April 1, 2014 the President of the Syrian National Coalition, Ahmed Jarba, visited Kessab, in order to congratulate his victorious troops on the attack and occupation of Kessab.&amp;#160; On May 23, 2014 he was sitting at the White House with Pres. Obama and Susan Rice.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; All 3 churches were attacked and damaged, the cultural center was destroyed to the ground, the houses, shops, restaurants and hotels were destroyed, or damaged.&amp;#160; Kessab is still unrepaired because of a lack of funds.&amp;#160; The people in Kessab are apple growers and soap makers.&amp;#160; They were not wealthy people.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Kessab still has the wall graffiti of the terrorists who wrote, ?Be Muslim or Die?.</p>
<p>Steven:&amp;#160; Did the US government condemn the attack?</p>
<p>Suzy: &amp;#160;&amp;#160;Yes, they condemned the attack, but accepted no complicity.&amp;#160; This was a direct lie.&amp;#160; Turkey could not have attacked Kessab, Syria without the full knowledge of USA.&amp;#160; The American backed rebels could not have attacked Kessab without the full knowledge and support of the US government.&amp;#160; It is the CIA office in Adana who oversaw and directed those attacks, destruction and occupation, and kidnappings.&amp;#160; Victoria Nuland, of the State Department, and Samantha Power at the UN, both issued a similar statement, saying the US regrets loss of life in Kessab, but that the attackers were not part of any US affiliated group.&amp;#160; &amp;#160;&amp;#160;This is a blatant lie proven by the fact that on April 1, 2014 the SNC Present Ahmed Jarba visited Kessab personally to congratulate his victorious troops there, and his troops are the American backed Free Syrian Army.&amp;#160; He took photos there and released them all over the internet, documenting his visit to the massacre site at Kessab.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; On May 23, 2014 Ahmed Jarba was sitting in the White House with President Obama and Susan Rice and others.&amp;#160; &amp;#160;This proves that the Obama administration was fully aware of the massacre, destruction, occupation and kidnappings which all occurred in Kessab.</p>
<p>Steven: What was the American Armenian response to the massacre at Kessab?</p>
<p>Suzy:&amp;#160; Various celebrities and various organizations expressed outrage and shock, but no action was taken to follow up. They all seemed to believe the US government press releases that the government was blameless.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Steven:&amp;#160; Did donations, supplies and repairs arrive in Kessab?</p>
<p>Suzy:&amp;#160; No.&amp;#160; Kessab did not receive any of the million US dollars raised by various American Armenian groups and churches.&amp;#160; The money was sent to Beirut, Lebanon but has never arrived in Kessab.&amp;#160; Some private donations from Syrian people has arrived, and the Russian government distributed some food baskets to most of the people in Kessab, and some school supplies arrived from a charity in USA, but that is all.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; The 2,000 residents of Kessab are still struggling with lack of food, lack of money to make necessary repairs to their homes.&amp;#160; For example, they have lost doors and windows in the attack, and have lost every piece of furniture and household appliances, even dishes, forks and spoons.</p>
<p>Steven: Why would terrorists steal refrigerators or stoves?</p>
<p>Suzy:&amp;#160; The terrorists did not steal the household items.&amp;#160; It was the Turkoman people, who are Syrian citizens, but have moved to Turkey, and they support the terrorists.&amp;#160; Pres. Erdogan of Turkey calls the Turkoman of Syria, ?My Grey Wolves?.&amp;#160; It was one of them who shot the Russian pilot dead while he was parachuting down from his plane.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; The Turkoman came to Kessab with the terrorists and they used huge cargo trucks to transport the household items to Turkey where they sold them all at cheap prices to the Turkish people in second hand shops.&amp;#160; This was witnessed by the kidnap victims in Kessab.</p>
<p>Steven: Final question: Why do you think the US allows their ally, Turkey, to be a support base for hundreds of thousands of armed terrorists? &amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Suzy:&amp;#160;The American government does not allow them, they are directed to do so by US policy, and do forget the CIA office in Adana is well known and established.&amp;#160; All American policy in Syria and Turkey is directed out of that office.&amp;#160; This is not a case of a rogue nation, like Turkey, running a terrorist operation unknown to the American government.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Turkey is run by a party, AKP, which is Radical ideology, and their President Erdogan is a devoted follower of Takfirism as a political ideology.&amp;#160; If this did not coincide with US policy, it would never be allowed. &amp;#160;&amp;#160;We are still praying that American foreign policy will change, and that the support of terrorists for the purpose of regime change will be stopped.&amp;#160;</p></article>

<p>If the rest of the world ate like Americans, the planet would have run out of freshwater 15 years ago, according to the world?s largest food company.</p>
<p>In private, Nestle executives told U.S. officials that the world is on a collision course with doom because Americans eat too much meat, and now, other countries are following suit, according to a <a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09BERN129_a.html" type="external">secret U.S. report</a>&amp;#160;titled ?Tour D?Horizon with Nestle: Forget the Global Financial Crisis, the World Is Running Out of Fresh Water.?</p>
<p>Producing a pound of meat requires a tremendous amount of water because farmers use tons of crops such as corn and soy to feed each animal, which require tens of thousands of gallons of water to grow. It is far more efficient when people eat the corn or soy directly.</p>
<p>The planet is a on a ?potentially catastrophic? course as billions of people in countries such as India and China begin eating more beef, chicken, and pork like their counterparts in Western countries, according to the 2009 report released by WikiLeaks and first reported by Reveal at The Center for Investigative Reporting in a <a href="https://www.revealnews.org/article/were-running-out-of-water-and-the-worlds-powers-are-very-worried/?utm_source=Reveal&amp;amp;utm_medium=social_media&amp;amp;utm_campaign=facebook" type="external">cache of water-related classified documents</a>. The Chinese now eat about half as much meat as Americans, Australians, and Europeans, a figure that continues to rapidly rise as more Chinese are lifted out of poverty and into the middle class.</p>
<p>And Nestle ? which makes Gerber baby food, Nescafe, Hot Pockets, DiGiorno pizza, Lean Cuisine, Stouffer?s, Nestea, Dreyer?s, and Haagen-Dazs ice cream ? is deeply concerned.</p>
<p>Here are some of the takeaways, with key quotes from the secret report:</p>
<p>?Nestle thinks one-third of the world?s population will be affected by fresh water scarcity by 2025, with the situation only becoming more dire thereafter and potentially catastrophic by 2050.?</p>
<p>?Problems with be severest in the Middle East, northern India, northern China, and the western United States.?</p>
<p>?Nestle starts by pointing out that a calorie of meat requires 10 times as much water to produce as a calorie of food crops. As the world?s growing middle classes eat more meat, the earth?s water resources will be dangerously squeezed.?</p>
<p>?Nestle reckons that the earth?s maximum sustainable freshwater withdrawals are about 12,500 cubic kilometers per year. In 2008, global freshwater withdrawals reached 6,000 cubic kilometers, or almost half of the potentially available supply. This was sufficient to provide an average 2,500 calories per day to the world?s 6.7 billion people, with little per capita meat consumption.?</p>
<p>?The current U.S. diet provides about 3600 calories per day with substantial meat consumption. If the whole world were to move to this standard, global fresh water resources would be exhausted at a population level of 6 billion, which the world reached in the year 2000.?</p>
<p>?There is not nearly enough fresh water available to provide this standard to a global population expected to exceed 9 billion by mid-century.?</p>
<p>?It is clear that current developed country meat-based diets and patterns of water usage do not provide a blueprint for the planet?s future. Based on present trends, Nestle believes that the world will face a cereals shortfall of as much as 30 percent by 2025. [Nestle] stated it will take a combination of strategies to avert a crisis.?</p>
<p>?Sensitive to its public image, Nestle has maintained a low profile in discussing solutions and tries not to preach ? the firm scrupulously avoids confrontation and polemics, preferring to influence its audience discretely by example.?</p></article>
<article id="0000637" published-at="2013-08-07" title="What Yukio Mishima Teaches Traditionalists"><p>Tim Stanley writes <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/timstanley/100229344/conservatives-dont-despair-of-our-corrupted-decadent-age-write-about-it/" type="external">a lyrical reflection</a> on the anti-modern ethos and suicide of Japanese novelist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukio_Mishima" type="external">Yukio Mishima</a>, a <a href="http://takimag.com/article/mishimapaleocon_as_samurai/print#axzz2bDuMe35e" type="external">favorite</a> of Justin Raimondo as well. Tim naturally finds much of Mishima?s life, especially how it ended, at odds with his own English Catholicism, but Mishima?s devotion to art inspires him:</p>
<p>I?ve reached the conclusion that traditionalists should reject politics and focus on art. We should take back control of the cultural institutions?universities, academies, churches, periodicals?and use them to promote beauty. We should try to live charitably, fully and well?to be examples and trend setters. We mustn?t turn our backs on the people we disagree with, but embrace and cherish them (please, do not conflate traditionalism with snobbery?Yukio wrote, ?The highest point at which human life and art meet is in the ordinary. To look down on the ordinary is to despise what you can?t have.?) And we should not accept our fate as mere critics of civilisation (the figurative version of Mishima?s suicide) but instead become the architects of a new one. For we traditionalists don?t contribute nearly enough to our society. Helping to improve it could mean anything from blogging to writing a symphony. My favourite way to keep the flame burning is to attend the Old Rite Catholic Mass. There is the real synergy of art and action: an ancient ritual, unchanged, unchanging that represents a communion with the past. And, of course, to God.</p>
<p>I?m reminded of the <a href="" type="internal">impeccably Bill Kauffman</a> line in ?Copperhead? (spoken by Esther), ?Maybe poetry is more important than politics.?</p>
<p>On the flipside, one of the problems with ?anti-modernists? has been precisely their preference for romantic feelings over political realities. It?s not a problem as long as you know what genre you?re working in?whether you?re writing, say, political essays or literary ones. But it becomes a source of self-delusion when you habitually measure an actual society, with its necessarily sordid economy and politics, against a literary ideal. That delusion drove Yukio Mishima to his doom. It?s driven some American anti-modernists to futile action in politics and unwholesome resentments in social life. Tim?s counsel is wise, however, for calling on traditionalists to contribute something real and beautiful, even to a social order they find thoroughly ugly and false.</p></article>
<article id="0000650" title=""><p>Michael S. Dell, chairman and chief executive officer at Dell Inc., joins Daniel L. Doctoroff, chief executive officer at Bloomberg, to discuss growth and technology in a globalized world. Dell describes his company?s expansion into solutions-based services such as cloud computing and cybersecurity, approach to innovation and risk, philanthropic activities, and&amp;#160;his role as the UN Foundation?s Global Advocate for Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>This meeting is part of the CFR CEO Speaker Series.</p>
<p>Michael Dell on the Dell company?s privatization in 2013:?I feel absolutely great. ?even more convinced that it was the right thing to do. We?ve been able to direct our energy 100 percent towards our customers. ?whether you've been at the company for a day or for a quarter of a century, you see the company really investing seriously behind the big areas where we want to grow versus what's going on competitively with split-ups and spinouts and all sorts of things. And it's working? We're gaining share. We're growing. And so that's a lot more fun than what we were doing before.?</p>
<p>Michael Dell on the growth of the data economy:&amp;#160; ?The big opportunity that I see is in turning the data into useful insights and outcomes. ?we've been helping customers store, protect, this data for a really long time. How many of them actually use the data to make better decisions, particularly in real time? ?that unleashes an enormous amount of productive power in the economy, that's a huge opportunity, and that requires all kinds of new capabilities.?</p>
<p>Michael Dell on his role as the UN Foundation?s Global Advocate for Entrepreneurship:?I really only have one job, and that is to convince world leaders that job creation and entrepreneurship should be one of the Sustainable Development Goals that they vote on in September 2015. ?if you look at the Sustainable Development Goals, it's pretty hard to imagine those things happening without job creation. ?70 percent to 90 percent come from new and emerging businesses, entrepreneurial businesses. ?if you want more entrepreneurs, you want more new businesses, make it easier.?</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Good evening. I'm Dan Doctoroff, for another four weeks, the CEO of Bloomberg. And I am thrilled to welcome you all to the Council on Foreign Relations meeting. This is "Growth, Innovation, and Technology: A Conversation with Michael Dell."</p>
<p>I want to thank Bernard Schwartz for his generosity is establishing this lecture in 2002. These are typically some of the most interesting meetings that the Council hosts, and we are thrilled to have you with us this evening.</p>
<p>Just a couple of announcements before we get started. Please turn off?not just put on vibrate?your electronic devices to avoid interference with the sound system or interruptions to our discussion. If you'd like to use an electronic device today, please do so outside the room. And I would like to remind the members that this meeting is on the record and livestreamed and recorded.</p>
<p>That out of the way, I just want to say something quickly. A few months ago, my friends at the Council asked me to moderate an evening discussion with a very special guest. I said, "Well, who is it?" And they said, "We're not going to tell you."</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>I said, "Well, give me some hints." They told me it was a guy by the name of Mike, a guy who founded his company&amp;#160;thirty years ago out of a single room, a guy who grew his company from its humble beginnings to become one of the most successful and influential technology companies in the world, a guy who became a billionaire and launched one of the largest and most important philanthropic organizations in the company, a guy who stepped down as CEO of the company that bears his name after a twenty-year tenure, only to return to the helm.</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>I can understand why CFR tapped me for this role. This one actually hits pretty close to home. And, by the way, Michael, I do have my resume in my...</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>... in my pocket here. Nonetheless, it truly is an honor to share the...</p>
<p>DELL: And I understand you have experience working with Michaels, so that's...</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: No question about it. So, no, it is my real pleasure to share the stage with Michael Dell, an entrepreneur so legendary that his name has been synonymous with innovation for three decades. Undoubtedly, you know the story of Michael growing the company that bears his name from nothing into the world's largest PC maker, and you know that in recent years he's not only returned to the helm, but taken the reins at a time of unprecedented upheaval in the PC and technology space. He's taken his company private and now is pivoting Dell's products, services, and culture with incredible speed that betrays its massive 100,000-person workforce.</p>
<p>Here, though, are a few facts that you may not know. When Michael was nine, he applied for his GED. Did you actually pass it?</p>
<p>DELL: No.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: No.</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>DELL: Well, I never got a chance to take it, so...</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Oh, OK. When he was twelve, he got a job washing dishes in a Chinese food restaurant. When he was a teenager, he set an all-time record by selling $18,000 worth of Houston Post newspaper subscriptions in a single year, a record that may well stand for all time...</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>... since nobody's selling digital subscriptions anymore. The next time you run into a kid?seriously?who thinks that he or she can take shortcuts or can just start or blog or write an app and get rich, tell them to read up on Michael Dell. He's the definition of work ethic. His unique combination of visionary thinking and determined effort makes him a role model to all of us who are looking to be successful in business and maybe even leave the world a little better off.</p>
<p>So, Michael, let's get started.</p>
<p>DELL: Thank you for that very kind introduction.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: You're welcome. So let me ask a question. What motivates you? What drives you? It's been that way since you were a little kid. What is it that has made you sort of the kind of driven entrepreneur that you are?</p>
<p>DELL: You know, I think it's just been curiosity. I like to win. You know, I like to do?be involved in interesting things. I mean, I've always been fascinated with business. And, you know, calculating machines intrigued me from a very early age. My dad had this adding machine, and, you know, it was the kind where you'd press the numbers and it would make a lot of noise and it was kind of fascinating to me that this thing was adding up numbers.</p>
<p>And then in the early '70s, the first semiconductor-based calculators came out. And I was, you know, like&amp;#160;seven years old, and it was pretty interesting to me to kind of see, this thing could do math problems. And then, you know, I was reading about the microprocessor and then...</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: At&amp;#160;seven years old.</p>
<p>DELL: Well, yeah, I mean, you know, a little later, you know, eleven, twelve.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Late bloomer, obviously.</p>
<p>DELL: And, you know, it was kind of the beginning of the microprocessor age. And, you know, it was just incredibly interesting to me that?you know, the idea that now you could have a computer yourself, right? I was in?I was in a math class in my junior high school, and I got lucky. My math class, there was a teletype terminal, and you could program, you know, and send the program off to the mainframe. The answer would come back, and that was just really interesting to me. So I, you know, dove into that, understood as much as I could about that.</p>
<p>And then, you know, right?that was right about the time the microprocessor-based computers were coming out. And so, you know, it's just been a big fun adventure that continues.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Certainly continues. So a year ago, you took the company private with Silver Lake. You?before the acquisition?were the CEO. You owned about 15 percent of the company. Today, you own about 70 percent of the company. Why do this? You know, you're worth billions of dollars. Why double down?</p>
<p>DELL: Why not? I mean...</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: It's a good question.</p>
<p>DELL: What else are you going to do? I mean?so, so, I mean...</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: I'm very familiar with guys who didn't know what else to do. So...</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>DELL: You know, in?in 2007, we set the business on a pretty new course, and we said we need to build capability&amp;#160;and solutions and services and software. We started acquiring other companies and really moving the business in a different direction, while still, you know, holding onto the kind of core infrastructure, product business that we had, but helping our customers solve the bigger problem that they were having.</p>
<p>So as we set about to do that, we acquired, you know,&amp;#160;forty companies, and those companies themselves acquired 150 companies. As we were doing that, you know, the financial markets, you know, were not really enjoying what we were doing, right? And so there was a lot of kind of competing pressures in terms of, OK, you know, don't do that. You know, have a bigger dividend. Do a share repurchase. You know, why don't you, you know, consider other alternatives?</p>
<p>So you saw this pressure between the kind of short-term-minded investor and the long-term-minded investor, and so I felt the best option for the company to be able to invest more in R&amp;amp;D and get on a growth path once again and continue the strategy that we're on, because we fundamentally haven't changed the strategy since we've gone private. We've just accelerated it.</p>
<p>And, you know, it was?it was a long, drawn-out process. We got through all that. And...</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Was there ever a time when you really thought you weren't going to succeed during that whole, long, drawn-out process?</p>
<p>DELL: There were some pretty dark moments. It was a pretty harrowing process. And, you know, whenever you go through something like that, you're effectively putting the company in play. And, you know, the company was available for sale, right? And it's the only way you can do it. And there were lots of other buyers that showed up and, you know, fortunately we got through that and, you know, ended up being the high bidder and paying the highest price available to shareholders.</p>
<p>But, you know, it inflicted, you know, uncertainty, you know, for a time on our team and customers. Fortunately, you know, our team really responded well to that. They held together extremely well. And when it was all done, boy, were they excited, right? You know, the energy and passion among the workforce has really been a much greater-than-I-expected positive surprise.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Why do you think that's happened? Let's step back for one sec. I mean, based on reports, including Bloomberg News, which is never wrong, the value of the company, the value of your stake has increased substantially. You've paid down about $3 billion of debt. And while we don't what earnings are, clearly revenues are up. I mean, after a year, it looks great. So what?just tell us how you feel after one year.</p>
<p>DELL: Feel absolutely great. I mean, you know, look...</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>You know, what?you know, I think even more convinced that it was the right thing to do. You know, we've been able to direct our energy 100 percent towards our customers. And what our team has seen is that there's real conviction in the investments in the business.</p>
<p>And so, you know, whether you've been at the company for a day or for a quarter of a century, you see the, you know, the company really investing seriously behind the big areas where we want to grow versus what's going on competitively with split-ups and spinouts and all sorts of things.</p>
<p>And it's working, right? We're gaining share. We're growing. And so that's a lot more fun than what we were doing before.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Now, you were the CEO before. The employees were the same employees. What's happened is you're not public anymore. Is it being not-public that makes that big a difference in terms of how excited the employees are, kind of how well you're actually doing? Is it really that big a difference?</p>
<p>DELL: You know, let me go back to this 2007 timeframe. And if you study the company, what you'll notice is that we went through a pretty big change in terms of what we were endeavoring to achieve, and we were, you know, acquiring all kinds of new businesses, new activities. There was a negative feedback loop, right? So we would go do those things, and then the market would kind of say, no, we don't want you to do that. Stock would go down. That wears on people. It's pretty difficult.</p>
<p>And, you know, now they see this basically permanent capital owning the company, and focused on the long term, and it's working. You know, we had?we had an event after everything was all done inside the company, and it was one of the most memorable events ever in the company. And, you know, we were playing loud rock-and-roll music. I mean, we had chains unleashed. I mean, it was webcast all over the world, you know, in every country where Dell operates, and teams were cheering and excited. And when you get that kind of passion unleashed with 100,000 people, and then you follow it up with investments and progress, that kind of force is really fantastic.</p>
<p>And so that's the momentum that we've had. We just had Dell World a few weeks ago in Austin. We had 5,000 customers. We had hundreds of customers coming and explaining how they're using our technology and our solutions to enable their businesses and, you know, essentially directed all the energy of the company to, how do we help our customers be successful?</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Yeah, I've read a lot about the customers and the comments that they've had about?just in a year?the company being so much more responsive to your customers, and it really is sort of that taking the public focus off, rechanneling that energy that's really produced that kind of creativity, entrepreneurship, and drive, despite the fact it's the same?basically the same employees and the same CEO. It's pretty interesting. Pretty interesting tale.</p>
<p>DELL: You know, what we heard from customers at Dell World was that, you know, the level of innovation that they've seen from the company in the last year is pretty remarkable. And one of the challenges for us is we've created so many new things, even we don't know about them, right? You know, all the people in the company don't know about them, and certainly our&amp;#160;ten million-plus customers don't all know about them yet. That's one of our challenges, is how do we get out and explain all the new capabilities we have in cybersecurity, in, you know, solutions, and in, you know, helping our customers, you know, deal with the cloud, deal with mobile technologies.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: The?speaking of long term, you know, you have a partner, owns 25 percent. Private equity firms?I used to run one?are generally not known for their really long-term horizon. You know, typically they have a fund and they want to liquefy in some form within&amp;#160;five years maybe. How do you think about that as a window? Or do you have an understanding with Silver Lake that you're going to do whatever it is for the long term and they're going to have to trust you and they're going to be around along for the ride?</p>
<p>DELL: Well, look, you know, we'll figure that out. You know, they're not permanent capital. They do have a fund. And there are any number of ways to, you know, to deal with that, so?you know, at the right time.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: You know, we talked about going private. Give me a couple of really good examples of how your decisionmaking has actually changed in the last year as a result of the fact that you don't have to deal with that, you know, ninety-second shot clock, that quarterly reporting that you did before?</p>
<p>DELL: Yeah, the ninety-day shot clock, so...</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: ninety-day shot clock, right.</p>
<p>DELL: You know, the first thing that you realize is that, in a large public company, you have a machine that is essentially constructed to?you know, all the leaders in the company are thinking about, OK, how do we deliver the results that we're supposed to be delivering, right? And anything that is sort of outside of that, you know, there's a lot of energy to not go do those things, right?</p>
<p>And so, first, you have to kind of retrain people to say, well, hey, you know, what are the new opportunities? Because we weren't necessarily seeing them all, and so you want to take on some new risks. You want to accept some volatility. And so as we go around and look at the business, we're finding areas where we can, you know, substantially grow parts of the business that are?you know, that have tremendous potential.</p>
<p>And, you know, so we're, you know, laying down new investments. You know, we had a review of our software business on Monday. And the team came back with, we have a particular business that's growing very, very rapidly, and, you know, and we kind of challenges the team at the prior review to come back with a plan to make that like four times bigger than it is now. And we think that's very possible. We think we know how to do that. The sort of GAAP financial results, you know, to go make that happen are not particularly great. But...</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: It's not something...</p>
<p>DELL: That's going to be fantastic business, right? So we're going to go do that, right? And, you know, as you discuss, you know, the business with your colleagues, it's like, OK, you know, this particular period, it's a nanosecond in the, you know, life of a company, how do we take the business we have today and grow it substantially faster than the industry for five years, for&amp;#160;ten years? And what do we need to go make that happen? So you start to turn on a whole different part of their brain for our team.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Let's talk for a second about the PC business. You know, in the last year, your market share in the PC business has gone from 11.9 percent, I think, to 13.3 percent. The PC business has turned out to be?at least the market itself, beyond your market share gains, better than you thought at the time of the acquisition. What's going on in that business right now? Help us understand some of those underlying dynamics?</p>
<p>DELL: Well, this is not really new information, but there are about 1.8 billion PCs in the world, roughly 380 million sold per year, and about 35 percent of them are four years old or older. This is actually very similar to the data, you know, even a year-and-a-half or two years ago. And so what you have is a business where at various points in the cycle, new things will come along where the customer will say, hey, this product is so much better than the one I have that's five years old that I should replace it.</p>
<p>Now, if we don't create a new product that's significantly better than the one we sold you in 2007, shame on us, right? You shouldn't buy one. But if we do, then, you know, we get this massive wave of replacement, and certainly there are other factors?Microsoft having a new release of the operating system or expiring the support for an older version?we see that in the data center, too. You know, there's a Windows Server 2003, millions of servers are going to be replaced, and we've got a whole new product cycle geared up for that.</p>
<p>And, look, I think with the excitement and energy around smartphones and tablets?at one point, there was this idea that somehow those were all going to replace the PC. And the reality inside businesses is a little bit different, right? You actually have more than one device. And, you know, each device doesn't necessarily replace the other device. So if I have a smartphone, I don't necessarily not have a PC. Maybe I have both. And, you know, the tablet, that may be a third device. You know, we have these convertible 2-in-1 devices that sort of combine the notebook and the tablet.</p>
<p>And then, of course, you've got the emerging markets, right, you know, enormous growth outside the United States and, you know, billions of new users coming online. And then the other interesting thing is, our business is way beyond the PC, right? For every&amp;#160;fifty or&amp;#160;sixty new smartphones that get minted out there in the world, there's a new server that pops up to feed the data, and as the world digitizes and as the cost of silicon comes down, you have this explosion in the amount of data. It all has to be stored, protected, analyzed, turned into valuable insights.</p>
<p>So the pie of opportunities for us is just growing, and then you have the?you know, the Internet of things, which are kind of like little PCs that are embedded in lots of, you know, devices out there. So we've got an expanding space that requires investment. It requires, you know, conviction.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Beyond the PC, as you mentioned, you're into all sorts of things. You want to be the end-to-end provider, so you're in cloud storage, you are in data analytics, you're in security, you're in mobile, kind of the list goes on and on. Of all of those non-PC products, which is the one that you are most excited about today?</p>
<p>DELL: Well, there's?this is like, you know, which of your children do you like the most, you know?</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: And I'm asking you to pick.</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>DELL: It's pretty hard to do.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Let me ask the question a different way. If you were a?you were twenty-something or&amp;#160;eighteen years old again, being the entrepreneur that you are, what's the company?what kind of company, in what area would you want to create today? Where would you want to focus?</p>
<p>DELL: The big opportunity that I see is in turning the data into useful insights and outcomes. And so it's what we call the data economy. And you think about how?you know, how's the tech sector going to grow from $3 trillion to $4 trillion? I'm convinced it's this data economy. And the way to think about it is, we've been helping customers store, protect, this data for a really long time. How many of them actually use the data to make better decisions, particularly in real time? The real answer is, almost none, right?</p>
<p>And so that unleashes an enormous amount of productive power in the economy, that's a huge opportunity, and that requires all kinds of new?new capabilities.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: The?just want to make sure we're not going too long so I want to give the audience time. Any big mistakes you've made over the last year? Anything you actually regret over the last year?</p>
<p>DELL: It's been a really good year. I don't?I don't?I don't have a lot of complaints.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: How many of you can say that?</p>
<p>DELL: You know, I think?I think we've?you know, we've been running pretty fast and doing some things, and we're learning things. So, for example, you know, we've been adding lots of channel partners into our business. We've been working more with systems integrators. We're covering, you know?working to cover a lot more customers. As we've done that, we've, you know, done some things with our 20,000-person sales force to try to line them up, you know, against the right opportunities. Sometimes we change things a little too fast, and that's disrupted the business, so we learn from that and change.</p>
<p>You know, I think it's, how fast do you learn? And how fast do you take learning? But, you know, so far, no real big mistakes, and?you know, we're doing a lot of experiments and funding a lot of new things that we're quite encouraged by.</p>
<p>I mean, we have a fantastic business in health care IT, where we are creating the health information systems, the evidence-based medicine systems, you know, the?you know, physician-affiliated systems. And, you know, health care IT is an enormously rapidly-growing sector. Well-positioned there. That's a place where we're, you know, investing.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: One thing our companies share, obviously, as we mentioned before, both have founders who have their names on the door. When I announced I was leaving, I was quoted in the New York Times as saying, "Mike is like God at Bloomberg. You know, he created the universe. He issued the Ten Commandments".</p>
<p>In our case, then he disappeared and came back. But, you know, the thing is, is that when you have God at the company, people are going to listen. And frequently they are going to be either afraid or intimidated to really push back. How do you encourage people to actually push back on you?</p>
<p>DELL: Well, I think you have to, first of all, look?look to make sure that, you know, that they're not telling you what you want to hear, and that's relatively easy to understand. But, you know, having an open culture, having, you know, a strong team. It's not just me. I mean, you know, we have an enormously talented group of people, and, you know, I'm fortunate to lead the company now, but, you know, you don't get to do everything forever.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: If you own 70 percent, you can, if you want, though.</p>
<p>DELL: But you still can't do it forever. You know, I think we've done a nice job in our culture of, you know, having active debate and discussion and discourse, you know, around, you know, ideas and?you know, it's absolutely important.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: The?beyond your role at Dell, you've also been a tremendous philanthropist. What are the things that you really would really like to focus on with your philanthropy going forward?</p>
<p>DELL: Yeah, you know, we've focused on areas where we can work for a few years and then leave, right, and have some change occur, and primarily focused on children and urban poverty. One of the areas where I think the foundation has done some incredible work is on, you know, measurement and data, particularly in the public school system.</p>
<p>There was a formative project in New York City that the foundation was very involved in. And out of that and a number of other things, we created this standard called Ed-Fi, which is now adopted in I think about&amp;#160;thirty-five of the&amp;#160;fifty states, and being used as a way?here's the problem: a&amp;#160;child goes from the third grade to the fourth grade. What does the fourth grade teacher know about how the child did on particular subjects? Did they have an attendance problem? You know, what do you actually know about this kid? At a small private school, maybe the teachers will talk to each other. They'll explain, you know, this is what you need to know about this kid to help the kid succeed.</p>
<p>The other challenge you have is you'll have two classrooms in the same school, kids go in, and they come out, but different outcomes. And who's doing anything about it? You know, what's the opportunity to expose that data to the principal, to the parents, right and, you know, make some real productive change in the system?</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Just one last question before we turn it over to the audience. Actually, you said that our foreign policy has been focused on, quote, "dropping bombs instead of dropping jobs," and that you're pushing to include job growth as part of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. How do you think developed countries can best help developing countries create good jobs?</p>
<p>DELL: Well, I took on this other job with the United Nations as the global advocate for entrepreneurship, and one of my observations traveling around the world is, you know, there are?there are places where there are lots of young people that are very excited about their future and they're often very near some of these conflict zones.</p>
<p>I mean, we have in Dell the example of Morocco, OK? And I remember this because we were looking at setting up a site in Northern Africa, and we were comparing Morocco and Tunisia. And it was about 60/40, you know, in favor of Morocco.</p>
<p>Now, the Tunisian government could have done a few things here and there, and maybe it would have been, you know, in favor of Tunisia, but Morocco won. And if you go to our site in Morocco, we've got like 2,000 people there. They're young, excited, bright-eyed, bushy-tailed. You know, the unemployment rate in Morocco is not very high. And those young people go home to their families and they, you know, believe that their future is going to be better, you know, tomorrow and?they're excited.</p>
<p>If you go to some of these conflict zones, you know, you can change the government, you can have whatever, you know, military action occurs. If you still have an enormous number of young people that are unemployed, you got a real problem. And so I think the?you know, you think about, where do the next 500 million jobs come from? Where do the next billion jobs come from? 70 percent to 90 percent of the new jobs anyway come from entrepreneurs, small-, medium-sized businesses, and so we've got to be thinking really seriously about, how do we create jobs and opportunity in those countries? Because no matter what you do, at the end of the day, if there aren't jobs, you're going to have a continuing problem and maybe worsening problem.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Great, thanks. So at this time, I want to invite members of our audience to join the conversation with their questions. And a reminder that this meeting is on the record. Wait for the microphone and speak directly into it. Please stand and state your name and affiliation, and please limit yourself to one question, and keep it concise to allow as many members as possible to speak.</p>
<p>So, right here.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Thank you so much. My name is Lara Setrakian. I'm with News Deeply. I'm a new media entrepreneur. And I'd love to get your take on risk-taking and resilience. You touched on some of it, but how do you really take risks? How do you make the choice to go for it? And when you have those dark moments, how do you, frankly, accelerate the time it takes to bounce back?</p>
<p>DELL: Yeah, well?you know, risk-taking for me is pretty natural. But I'm not?I'm not like a gambler, and I don't jump out of airplanes, you know? So my risks are pretty calculated. But, you know, I think big companies are not good at taking risks. The bigger they get, the?you know, even the word "risk," you can't find it in big companies. It sort of gets taken out of the building.</p>
<p>So my job is to make sure it stays there and we talk about it, we talk about taking risks, which basically means you've got to accept some failure. And, you know, a way to think about it, you know, inside an organization is, I don't want you to do five things and get all five right. I want you to do&amp;#160;ten things, and if you get&amp;#160;seven or&amp;#160;eight of them right, that's OK.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: And you actively communicate that?</p>
<p>DELL: Yeah. Now, if you keep making the same mistake over and over again, that's not risktaking, right?</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>So..so be clear about that.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Exactly. Yes, right here.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Thank you very much&amp;#160;Mahesh Kotecha.&amp;#160;it's a thrill to speak to the guy who created the machines I use all the time. May I say...</p>
<p>DELL: Thank you.</p>
<p>QUESTION: May I say that the best product you have for a small business, which I hope you take internationally, is the Gold Support. I think it's phenomenal. And without that, a small business can't operate. So I'm asking you, what do you do about that internationally?</p>
<p>DELL: You might be referring to our Pro Support.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Yes (OFF-MIKE)</p>
<p>DELL: Yeah, Pro Support?and we have something new called Pro Support Plus, even better than Pro Support.</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>Cleverly named. We have been actively expanding the global footprint of our support. In fact, this last year, we opened up support in a huge number of countries across Africa, you know, Southern Asia. Today, we actually cover 99 percent of the world's GDP with our support services, so I think we've already done it. There are a few countries where we're not allowed to operate, and we?you know, can't help you there. But, you know, it's like?you know, the three or four you would think of.</p>
<p>But, you know, we are everywhere else. And that's a tremendously attractive element, particularly for companies that are globalizing. So they'll show up in, you know, Azerbaijan and Ivory Coast and, you know, anywhere else and we're already there. You know, we started by following our customers around, and it started, you know, with the big global companies. But now you're seeing a lot of small- and midsized companies that are globalizing much more rapidly.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: In the back, on the aisle?</p>
<p>QUESTION: My name is&amp;#160;Chandrakant Pancholi&amp;#160;from (inaudible). And I'm still using your desktop since&amp;#160;ten years. But I'm...</p>
<p>DELL: Thank you.</p>
<p>QUESTION: I'm still very, very?you are very&amp;#160;vague about your business model. And I'm trying to figure out what type of business model you are following now, and it has nothing to do with few drinks I had at the reception.</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>But are you following the crowd? Are you having the same thing, like software business and security business and other things, which other people are doing? So how do you differ? What is your return on equity, as you are private now, and whether you're going to become an IPO again.</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>DELL: Well, I can tell you that the return on equity for Dell going back to, you know, the late '80s, today forward, has averaged, you know, well over 30 percent. And we do have an attractive business model from a capital and cash conversion standpoint.</p>
<p>You know, there's been a pretty big change in the last four or five years, as we've focused more on solutions. So we're definitely in the product business, but, you know, we see our growth opportunity as helping customers solve the bigger problems, you know, going beyond just products.</p>
<p>And what we found, as we created more and more powerful products, is that just having the product wasn't sufficient. You needed to be able to help the customer apply the solution. Some customers wanted us to actually run it for them. And we needed combinations of hardware and software and services together to be able to address the opportunity.</p>
<p>But we hope we can replace your ten-year-old desktop. There have been a few advances in technology that might interest you, recently.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Right there, please.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Hi, I'm Marshall Sonenshine, chairman of Sonenshine Partners, and I'm on the faculty at Columbia. When we break, I'll give you the piece that I wrote called "The Curious Case of Dell." It's published at Columbia Business School. It's now a case.</p>
<p>And it talks about some of the curiosities that I think bedeviled the company as a public company, which was a tough ride for a while, and that bedeviled the process of going private. But I'm wondering what some of the curiosities are about American business from your perspective during that long ride, about being public, about the nature of boards or activists or financial markets or competitiveness, any of the great themes that we think about when we reflect on American business in the world today, must?I imagine?must strike you as including some curiosities. What are some of the things that you witnessed over these past&amp;#160;twenty years that maybe could change for the better, if somehow one could flip a switch and change things?</p>
<p>DELL: Well, you know, look, we think there's an important role for the public markets for sure. And, by the way, you know, in the&amp;#160;twenty-five years that Dell was a public company, our shares appreciated 13,500 percent, which was&amp;#160;twenty-seven times better than the S&amp;amp;P 500. So if somebody had bought the shares at the time of the IPO, and the shares were sold at the time of going private, that was quite an attractive return.</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>You know, one observation I have during that&amp;#160;twenty-five years, certainly, is more and more of the available time of the?of the board was spent on backward-looking activities, as opposed to forward-looking activity. And this was a function of, you know, Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank and, you know, all of those kinds of activities.</p>
<p>You know, I think there are some new models that are being explored out there in terms of, you know, companies that go public but want to retain a longer-term perspective. You know, we're perfectly happy being private, so?you know, that's a big question you're asking.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Let me ask a question about that public versus private. I mean, there are companies, as you point out, that sort of managed to maintain that long-term perspective. Amazon, as an example. You know, Jeff Bezos has managed to convince the market that, you know, it doesn't matter what happens in the short run, that he's making these very smart investments, he has the track record to demonstrate it, and that over time it will pay off. You couldn't have done the same thing as a public company, sort of better articulated that vision and got?given your success, given what you delivered for shareholders over time, and gotten permission to make the kinds of investments that you felt you needed to?</p>
<p>DELL: You know, I'm an optimistic guy, so could we have done it? Yeah, I think we could do it. I think it would be slower, right? So?you know, and so, you know, being private gives us the freedom and flexibility to do it in a different way, and accepting some of the volatility and the risk that goes with that.</p>
<p>And, you know, I think that's?you know, in our case, there was a pretty big disconnect between the views of some of the more short-term-minded investors and what I think of as the long-term owner-operator perspective.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Yes?</p>
<p>QUESTION: Benjamin Barber. We've talked a lot about business here, not so much about technology and not all at all about the background environment of science, in which as a technological entrepreneur you operate. I have a background question which really interests me.</p>
<p>As somebody who's been an innovator and a leader in business technology, you live in a country where a considerable preponderance of people don't believe in science. You know, they're creationists. They don't believe in the science of climate warming. They really don't seem to know the difference between science and opinion. We had a president not so long ago who said science is just another form of opinion and you have a right to yours, I have a right to mine.</p>
<p>I'm wondering how it is for you to do business in technology in a country which is probably in the developed world the most backward in the world, in terms of its popular understanding of science.</p>
<p>DELL: Well, I'm not sure what your question is, but...</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>But, you know, we love doing business in America, you know, and I think it's a great country. You know, we do have about half our business outside the United States. You know, the U.S., from a technological standpoint, is quite advanced. And, you know, don't really see your question manifested?manifesting itself as a problem from, you know, our sort of business perspective.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Sir?</p>
<p>QUESTION:&amp;#160;Eyrique Miller&amp;#160;from JPMorgan. I'm a tech banker. The first laptop I was given&amp;#160;twenty years ago was a Dell. And the one that I got three months ago when I took this job was a Dell, so I've upgraded.</p>
<p>DELL: Thank you.</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>QUESTION: My question for you?I guess somewhat along those lines?is really, you know, given your role as the global advocate for entrepreneurship, what are the things that you're going to advocate for or you are advocating for from a U.S. perspective in terms of what you'd like to see, in terms of policy and our regulations around technology.</p>
<p>DELL: Yeah, my role with the U.N. is very, very focused. I really only have one job, and that is to convince world leaders that job creation and entrepreneurship should be one of the Sustainable Development Goals that they vote on in September 2015. And, you know, if you're in business or you're an entrepreneur or you're involved in creating businesses, this seems pretty obvious to you. But apparently, not the case with all world leaders, so my job is to convince them of that.</p>
<p>You know, simple observation is if you look at the Sustainable Development Goals, it's pretty hard to imagine those things happening without job creation. And where do the jobs come from? As I said earlier, 70 percent to 90 percent come from new and emerging businesses, entrepreneurial businesses. We need more of those.</p>
<p>You know, you could argue?and I'm more of a?you know, I'm not waiting for the government to, you know, help me conduct my business. But, look, government can make it a little bit easier or a little bit harder. And I think, you know, I was in France last week. We as Dell pay&amp;#160;seventy different kinds of taxes in France. Pretty complicated, right, just to calculate it, you know?</p>
<p>And so, you know, if you want?you want more entrepreneurs, you want more new businesses, you know, make it easier. The big companies often have a voice. The smaller companies, the entrepreneurs often don't have a voice, but that's actually where the jobs are being created.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Yes?</p>
<p>QUESTION: Jason Tepperman from Promontory Local Credit. A big part of competing in the system business historically, at least, has been being a low-cost producer, managing inventory, working capital, and historically I think a lot of industries have found that when they're a low-cost producer, it drives away some of the talent they need or the ambition that they need. Do you see that as a tension in your business? And if you do, how do you?how do you manage that element of your activity?</p>
<p>DELL: You know, I think it's another kind of innovation. I mean, we have?in our operations discipline, we have a process where every couple of years, we will hire a bunch of new graduates, often from programs like the LFM program at MIT, and we'll give them a challenge, you know, from an operational perspective, whether it relates to inventory or cycle time or, you know, process flows or?quality, whatever it might be, combinations of those things. And we don't actually know how to do it, right? We don't tell them that.</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>But, you know, they'll often get 80 percent or 90 percent of the way, maybe even, you know, exceed what?and they'll create a lot of new ways of doing things. And that's how you keep, you know, improving. And, you know, if we don't do it, somebody else is going to, and so, you know, that's just another form of innovation, as far as I'm concerned.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: We're in a world in which there's massive investment in start-ups. How do you as a big company attract some of the top talent sort of without that sort of big equity opportunity that so many young people in particular are looking for?</p>
<p>DELL: Yeah, it is a pretty amazing time right now, in terms of start-ups, and I think that's overall quite a healthy thing. You could argue whether it's too frothy or not, but in aggregate, it's a very good thing for the economy.</p>
<p>We haven't really had a problem attracting people to the company. And I'll say, since we've gone private, the interest in Jordan&amp;#160;and the company&amp;#160;has gone up, you know, considerably, because, you know, people see it as another wave of the adventure and the growth.</p>
<p>And we are headquartered in Austin, Texas. A lot of people like to come to Austin. Hopefully they don't all come, because we can't have them all coming there, but, you know, we're operating all over the world and?there are definitely particular kinds of skills where there are shortages for our whole industry. But we've been able to attract and develop the talent we need for the most part.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Do you think we are in a start-up bubble right now?</p>
<p>DELL: I think there are some concerning signs out there. You know, it's always hard to, you know, call these things specifically. You know, there?the level of kind of digital disruption, reinvention that's going on right now is very, very high. I think we're going to see more of that, not less of it. So that's the offsetting piece of this.</p>
<p>And what's interesting about many of those companies is they're business model innovations, they're not really technical innovations. And they're incredibly hard to predict, you know, if you're trying to think about the technology. So, you know, we can think about what's going on in software or semiconductors or material science, but that won't lead you to understand eBay or Uber or airbnb. So those are different kinds of combinations of technology and business model.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Yes?</p>
<p>QUESTION: Laetitia Garriott, Escape Dynamics, a space technology company. Michael, as a leading technology entrepreneur, what do you see your role in maybe helping companies like?not the companies themselves, but innovation in the U.S.? We see Tesla. We see Uber, that you mentioned, running into big regulatory issues that often are linked to very outdated regulation and context. And they're each battling on their own, and innovation in the country's completely stifled.</p>
<p>And do we let them just fight on their own? Or do all technology entrepreneur like you?is there?do you have a role to play? Do you do anything about it? What can we do about it as a nation?</p>
<p>DELL: I think we have a role to play. You know, we've taken the approach of going to the government, to Washington, to explain what it is we're doing, what role our industry plays in creating new jobs, and, you know, being a bit proactive. And, you know, also with the belief that if we?if we do nothing, you know, we're likely to get, you know, regulations that don't really contemplate our business or our industry. And, you know, that's worked reasonably well.</p>
<p>There are always going to be these new businesses that pop up that are, you know, very disruptive and concerning for incumbents. I don't know that there's a real easy problem to that?or there's no easy solution to that. And then you have the states, you know, getting involved in a number of those.</p>
<p>You know, regulation is a really bad way to slow down innovation, because, you know, the innovation will just pop up in another country. That other country will move ahead. And?but, you know, again, we have about half our business outside the United States. And comparatively speaking, the U.S. is quite an attractive place to do business, you know, as compared with most places in the world.</p>
<p>So, you know, for all the problems and challenges and opportunities we have here, I think it still ranks?and, you know, if you look at net investment flows, you know, the U.S. is still attracting tremendous amounts of investment. A lot of our European customers are expanding aggressively here in the United States because they see it as an attractive market.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Yes, sir? Right there.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Thanks. Eric Shube. We've seen a bunch of high-profile hacking incidents recently, including Sony this week, I guess, and suggestions that there are national security issues associated with that. What should we as a country be doing about that?</p>
<p>DELL: You know, this is a complex issue. You have an enormous number of bad actors out there. And the number of them are increasing. We've identified about 1,100 different specific groups. We have a business called SecureWorks that helps protect the largest banks and financial companies, pharmaceutical companies, anybody with valuable IP, and also helps respond when there are, you know, incidents that occur.</p>
<p>This is kind of the?the new form of warfare. And, you know, there's intellectual property theft. There's state-sponsored. There are organized crime groups. There are, you know, all kinds of activist groups. You know, there are things that the government can do, and the government has some groups that, you know, communicate with those of us on the technology sector that are working on this problem. There are some limitations in the regulations in terms of our ability to share information with the government. There's work going on to make that a bit easier.</p>
<p>And then?and then, you know, there's this societal issue, which relates to privacy. If you want to be private, you're also anonymous. If you want to be anonymous, then we can't tell you where the bad guys are. So how private do you want to be? This is not for me to answer; it's for society to answer. And, you know, we deal with this in, you know, airports and other public venues where, you know, there's inspection and authentication.</p>
<p>You know, inside your company, I mean, Dan, you wouldn't allow somebody in your company to sort of roam around the network and take whatever information and do whatever they wanted, and you had no idea who they are, right? You kind of want to know who?but you can do that, because, you know, it's your company and, you know, you can control the environment there.</p>
<p>You'll probably see more and more of those kinds of things. But the problem's getting more challenging, because you have this federation of different systems and different users and?it requires a really build-out of capability.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: We have time for one more question. In the back?</p>
<p>QUESTION: Hi, I'm Amy Wilkinson. I'm an author with Simon and Schuster, publishing an entrepreneurship book. So I'm curious your perspective on running a technology company in Texas versus Silicon Valley and the advantages regionally, you know, for where you are located. And can you do this anywhere? Could you do it in Ohio? Could you do it in Wyoming? Like, you know, how do you start a high-growth business anywhere?</p>
<p>DELL: You know, I just started in Texas, because that's where I was. And...</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>You know, we have?we have a great office in Silicon Valley that came mostly from acquiring a bunch of other companies. I see a lot of the Silicon Valley companies coming to Texas. And, you know, if you look at the economy in Texas relative to the whole country, it's done very well. And it is a great place to do business.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: You sound like Rick Perry.</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>DELL: Well, let's get back here on topic, first of all.</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER)</p>
<p>So, look, I think?I think if you want to find a great company, first, you'll find it a great university. And, in fact, I would tell you that there's no great company where there's not a great university nearby. And it takes a long time to build great universities. It may be 100 years, right? You know, these things don't pop up in a decade.</p>
<p>And there are a lot of great universities out there. You know, we see start-ups, you know, all over the country, all over the world. There definitely are these beehives of activity and incubators and pools of talent. You know, our company, as it grew, recruited a lot of talent that came to Austin, to help?to help the business grow.</p>
<p>And, you know, certainly, it's not going to all be in one place. But, you know, for us, Texas has been great. That's where I was born. But we have?you know, 96 percent of the people we want to sell to don't live in America. And so, you know, we're out there expanding all over the world. That's where we see our market.</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: Well, I think that's about all the time we have. I want to thank Michael Dell for his candor.</p>
<p>DELL: Good to be here.</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE)</p>
<p>DOCTOROFF: I'd like to highlight that our next CEO speaker series with DuPont's Ellen Kullman will be on December 18th. And thank you very much for joining us this evening.</p></article>
<article id="0000656" title="Steve Bannon mulling launch of network ?to the right of Fox News,? report says"><p>Ousted White House chief strategist Steve Bannon?s return to Breitbart may trigger more shockwaves than previously thought, as he is now rumored to be mulling a network to the right of Fox News.</p>
<p>Bannon?s friends and allies are already wondering whether the former Trump associate?s new project will be a full-fledged TV operation or initially streamed online.</p>
<p>Former Fox News boss Roger Ailes, prior to his death in May, had even been in contact with ?Bannon the Barbarian? about starting a new channel, according to Axios.</p>
<p>And Bannon was reportedly thrilled with the idea, since he views Rupert Murdoch?s effective handover of Fox to his more liberal sons as the ruination of the right-leaning network. James Murdoch has already pledged a $1 million gift to the Anti-Defamation League in a rebuke to President Trump over his even-handed remarks about the Charlottesville violence.</p>
<p>The political operative was back as executive chairman at Breitbart News just hours after leaving ? or being told to leave ? the White House and has since met with billionaire financier Bob Mercer, who has already committed to supporting a global expansion of the far-right news machine.</p>
<p>Bannon, ever a divisive figure in the West Wing, was also quick to announce that he will be ?going to war for Trump against his opponents: on Capitol Hill, in the media, and in corporate America,? as he told Bloomberg Businessweek on his first day away from political life.</p>
<p>But other so-called opponents of what he sees as the true Trump team also include First Daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, who hold official White House posts despite being significantly more socially liberal than the president. House Speaker Paul Ryan, never an enthusiastic Trump supporter, is also likely to find himself in the newsman?s sights.</p>
<p>?The Trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over,? Bannon told the Weekly Standard.</p>
<p>?I feel jacked up?I?ve got my hands back on my weapons?I am definitely going to crush the opposition. There?s no doubt. I built a f*cking machine at Breitbart, and now?we?re about to rev that machine up,? he added.</p>
<p>And if his old comrades-at-arms are to be believed, it is only a matter of time before everyone knows whether Breitbart will be the sole vehicle for those attacks ? or if a new right-wing media squadron is about to be assembled.</p>

<article id="0000657" published-at="2007-07-19" title="Pretty Please, With Cuomo On Top"><p>New York state sues ExxonMobil over oil spill foot-dragging</p>
<p>A shot has been fired in the quiet oil-spill battle in Brooklyn, N.Y.?s Greenpoint neighborhood: the state has sued ExxonMobil to force the cleanup of the estimated 8 million gallons of oil and petroleum byproducts still underground after a 1950 explosion. The spill, larger than the Exxon Valdez debacle, was found in 1978; in 1990, the state asked ExxonMobil nicely to please take care of the 17 million remaining gallons. Since then, the company has reportedly cleaned up about 9.3 million gallons. But New York wants the rest gone soon, and is asking ExxonMobil ? as well as BP, Chevron, utility KeySpan, and mining company Phelps Dodge ? to treat contaminated soil and groundwater and restore nearby Newtown Creek. The suit follows two others filed since 2004 by citizens and the advocacy group Riverkeeper. ?This suit sends the message that even the largest corporations in the world cannot escape the consequences of their misdeeds,? says state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. Well, only for 57 years or so.</p></article>

<article id="0000663" published-at="2017-12-27" title="Love solar power but got no rooftop? &quot;Shared solar&quot; is coming for you."><p>To date, solar power has mostly been available to utilities (as big power plants) or individual home and business owners (as rooftop panels).</p>
<p>Left out has been ... well, everyone else, those of us who are not utility executives and do not have the money, wherewithal, or suitable rooftops to install solar ourselves. That's a lot of people who love solar power but have no way to get directly involved in it.</p>
<p>Happily, that situation is rapidly changing, thanks to the growth of shared solar. Shared solar refers to small-scale solar installations that multiple individuals co-own, or that divide their power output among multiple "subscribed" individuals. It's a way for all those non-rooftop folks to directly support clean energy, while also supporting local jobs and economic development.</p>
<p>Here's how shared solar fits into the larger energy picture, how it works, its benefits and drawbacks, and its future potential.</p>
<p>I am <a href="" type="internal">on record</a> predicting that solar photovoltaic (PV) cells are eventually going to take over the world. That is to say, they will eventually become the world's predominant source of power. I'm not crazy enough to try to predict exactly when ? 2060? 2080? ? but I think it will happen within the century. (For more on why, see <a href="" type="internal">this post</a>.)</p>
<p>One of those reasons is simple: Solar PV is incredibly scalable.</p>
<p>Because individual solar cells are so small, it's possible to scale a PV installation to almost any size or shape. If coal and nuclear plants are giant boulders, PV is like sand, sifting in to fill any crack, available building, structure, or piece of land. It's possible to put a solar cell in a <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/188667-a-fully-transparent-solar-cell-that-could-make-every-window-and-screen-a-power-source" type="external">piece of glass the size of a coaster</a>. It's also possible to build a 2,400-acre, <a href="http://energy.gov/articles/agua-caliente-worlds-largest-solar-photovoltaic-plant-helps-advance-americas-solar" type="external">290 MW power plant</a> with PV panels (with larger plants to come soon).</p>
<p>Most notably, it's possible to build at any size in between.</p>
<p>If you wanted to build a coal or nuclear plant, you'd be limited by&amp;#160;capital to fund a plant, land on which to site it, and the patience and expertise to get through the years-long process of building it. A limited number of entities fit the bill.</p>
<p>By contrast, there isn't one market for PV, there are dozens of them. At every scale, there are different customers, different incentives, different financing structures, and different value propositions.</p>
<p>The market for solar windows and building materials is different from the market for rooftop solar or commercial-building solar, which is different from the market for community-scale (0.5 to 5 MW) solar, the market for midsize (5 to 20 MW) solar, and the market for utility-scale (20 MW and up) solar.</p>
<p>This fluidity of solar PV isn't fully appreciated in the US because the market has been somewhat crudely divided between (fairly small) residential and commercial rooftops and (fairly large) utility-scale solar plants ? tiny or huge.</p>
<p>It's only now that PV is starting to filter into those in-between markets in earnest, as legacy regulatory, legal, and financial structures are jury-rigged to accommodate it, in fits and starts.</p>
<p>The good news is that because PV is seeping down into the cracks, you'll soon be able to access solar power directly, even if you don't have a suitable rooftop, good credit, or a home state that offers net metering policies (a category that cumulatively includes 77 percent of Americans, <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/research/report/us-community-solar-market-outlook-2015-2020" type="external">according to GTM Research</a>). That's the promise of shared solar.</p>
<p>The bad news is it may take a while.</p>
<p>First, some quick definitions, since terminology tends to be a little fuzzy in this area. I'll follow the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) in defining "community-scale solar" as any solar installation between 0.5 and 5 MW. "Shared solar" refers to the subset of community-scale solar that is open to shared public participation.</p>
<p>Speaking of RMI, it released a <a href="http://blog.rmi.org/blog_2016_03_17_5_reasons_community_scale_solar_is_a_multi_gw_market_opportunity" type="external">bullish report</a> on community-scale solar earlier this year. Here's how it frames the problem:</p>
<p>Solar PV is growing very quickly, but it remains a tiny portion (1 percent) of US electricity. To scale up, it needs to access new markets. RMI claims that community-scale solar is a multi-GW market opportunity.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of community-scale solar. The first is utility-owned, with power sold to utility customers ? a traditional arrangement between a utility and a power plant developer, just on a smaller scale. Lots of smaller utilities, municipals, and co-ops are getting into this.</p>
<p>The other is shared solar, in which customers a) share ownership of a community-scale PV array, b) "subscribe" to the power output of such an array, or c) both.</p>
<p>Existing community-scale solar is split roughly half and half between those two types.</p>
<p>How many shared solar projects are there? From a 2016&amp;#160; <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/energy-and-resources/articles/community-solar-market-renewable-energy-trends.html" type="external">report</a> by Deloitte:</p>
<p>In 2010, only two shared solar projects existed [in the US]. Today 77 utilities administer 111 projects across 26 states, accounting for a combined capacity of about 106 megawatts (MW).</p>
<p>That's a tiny base ? less than 1 percent of installed solar PV capacity, according to GTM ? but growth is accelerating.</p>
<p>According to RMI, if you include both types, community-scale solar could grow to 30 GW capacity by 2020.</p>
<p>Look closely at this graph. Those three dark blue lines at the left are 2020 forecasts for shared solar ? one from <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/research/report/us-community-solar-market-outlook-2015-2020" type="external">GTM Research</a> and two, low and high scenarios, from the <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy15osti/63892.pdf" type="external">National Renewable Energy Laboratory</a> (NREL).</p>
<p>The light blue line represents the boost that can come from cost reductions, which RMI thinks can drive the final installed cost of community solar down 40 percent, where it can compete with utility-scale solar prices. (The report has a detailed breakdown of where those cost reductions can be found.)</p>
<p>The green line represents the extension of the federal solar tax credit, which is a <a href="" type="internal">done deal as of last December</a>.</p>
<p>And the red lines represent non-shared community-scale solar owned and run by utilities ? the kind we're ignoring for now.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's the potential of shared solar by 2020: somewhere between GTM's 1.8 GW, NREL's 5.5?11 GW, and RMI's 15 GW.</p>
<p>That's a wide range of predictions, evidence of how fuzzy the category is (everyone's counting slightly different things), how fluid the market is, and how much future growth depends on unpredictable swings in policy, markets, and customer demand. Most analysts agree, though, that shared solar is likely to get as big as, and eventually surpass, rooftop solar. It is a much, much bigger "addressable market."</p>
<p>Making generalizations about shared solar is a pain in the ass; there are many different structures found across the 26 states where shared solar projects exist.</p>
<p>Here's a visual, from the Department of Energy's Sunshot Initiative, showing shared solar models:</p>
<p>Typically, customers "subscribe" to a shared solar project. Some subscribe to a certain amount of capacity (say, the output of one panel), measured in kW. Some subscribe to a certain amount of energy, measured in kWh. The credit for the power appears on a customer's utility bill.</p>
<p>Who runs these things? "Shared solar arrays," writes NREL, "can be hosted and administered by a variety of entities, including utilities, solar developers, residential or commercial landlords, community and nonprofit organizations, or a combination thereof."</p>
<p>Exactly who can build and run a shared solar project depends on whether it is located in a regulated or deregulated energy market (more on that in a second) and what type of utility service area it's in.</p>
<p>Shared solar is overwhelmingly driven, at least at the moment, by customer demand. So it makes sense that the utilities most responsive to their customers ? co-ops, where customers are also owners ? are leading the way on shared solar projects.</p>
<p>Deloitte offers this information-packed breakdown of shared solar by utility type:</p>
<p>As you can see, co-ops run the largest number of shared solar projects, but those projects are typically tiny, in the low kilowatts. (They are very often rural.)</p>
<p>Investor-owned utilities administer fewer projects, but they account for a much larger share of total shared-solar capacity, because those projects are generally bigger. They are more likely to be owned by third-party developers who want to maximize economies of scale by building up against the limit of what counts as community scale (it's 1 MW in Minnesota, 2 MW in Colorado, for instance).</p>
<p>There are many differences in programs ? who administers them, their minimum sizes, the length of the contract, and much more. Here's a <a href="http://www.utilitydive.com/news/5-things-you-should-know-about-community-solar-programs/415420/" type="external">good, short guide</a> to questions you should ask before jumping in; here's a more <a href="https://www.solarelectricpower.org/media/422096/community-solar-design-plan_web.pdf" type="external">in-depth guide</a> on program design, from the Solar Electric Power Association.</p>
<p>For now, the shared solar market is fairly concentrated in a few friendly states. GTM, which expects the shared solar market to grow sevenfold in just the next two years, projects that 80 percent of that near-term activity will happen in just four states: <a href="https://joinmosaic.com/blog/sb-43-californias-community-shared-solar/" type="external">California</a>, <a href="http://www.pv-magazine.com/news/details/beitrag/colorado-pioneers-community-solar-for-low-income-residents_100020961/#.Vem6Ns8P4UQ.twitter" type="external">Colorado</a>, <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/nrg-energy-launches-a-community-solar-play-with-100mw-in-the-pipeline" type="external">Massachusetts</a>, and <a href="http://www.utilitydive.com/news/why-community-solar-is-exploding-in-minnesota/360241/" type="external">Minnesota</a>.</p>
<p>Fun fact: What's generally acknowledged as <a href="http://www.hcn.org/issues/47.4/community-solar-comes-of-age-in-the-west" type="external">the very first US shared solar project</a> was built in Ellensburg, Washington, in 2006. To find out if there's a project near you, visit <a href="http://www.sharedrenewables.org/" type="external">Shared Renewables HQ</a>, a great clearinghouse for info (created by <a href="http://votesolar.org/" type="external">Vote Solar</a>).</p>
<p>Deloitte identifies four policy drivers for shared solar (and has an <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/energy-and-resources/articles/community-solar-market-renewable-energy-trends.html" type="external">interactive map</a> showing how those policies are distributed):</p>
<p>Some states require utilities to run shared solar projects; some just require pilot projects; some have proposed but not yet passed policies.</p>
<p>Net metering allows customers to count "behind-the-meter" power production (like rooftop solar panels) against their utility bill, effectively rolling their meter backward. But conventional net metering can only be used by individual utility ratepayers (a homeowner or a business).</p>
<p>Virtual net metering allows third parties to aggregate multiple utility ratepayers behind a single (virtual) meter. So, for instance, an apartment building owner could install a solar array and renters could subscribe to it, each receiving a proportional credit on their utility bill. For obvious reasons, VNM opens up lots of new opportunities for shared solar.</p>
<p>In regulated utility markets, customers receive energy only from the utility, by law. In (some) deregulated markets they have "retail choice," which means they can choose their own power providers.</p>
<p>In regulated states, only utilities can run shared solar programs. In deregulated states, third-party providers can compete in the space.</p>
<p>Many states require that utilities get a certain percentage of their power from renewable sources. Obviously that gives utilities more incentives to seek out solar.</p>
<p>I would add one item to Deloitte's list. It's not a policy driver, but it's a driver nonetheless.</p>
<p>For many utilities, especially smaller ones, setting up a shared solar program can be a daunting administrative task, requiring all sorts of unfamiliar business and financing arrangements.</p>
<p>There are now companies that offer all those administrative hassles as a service ? an off-the-shelf product that will set up the program, administer it, and bill customers. Colorado's <a href="http://www.easycleanenergy.com" type="external">Clean Energy Collective</a>, for instance, is both a shared solar developer and a vendor of shared-solar services to utilities.</p>
<p>As more such vendors come online, setting up shared-solar programs will get easier and easier and spread faster.</p>
<p>Shared solar has many of the benefits of distributed "behind-the-meter" solar and many of the benefits of larger solar power plants, with few of the drawbacks of either.</p>
<p>Like utility-scale solar, it enjoys economies of scale and simple, established financing models; unlike utility-scale solar, it can squeeze into almost any surface or piece of land, near existing transmission or distribution lines.</p>
<p>Like distributed, behind-the-meter solar it is low risk, can be sited near existing load, increases the resilience of the distribution grid, and satisfies the powerful consumer craving for solar power; at the same time, it is cheaper, simpler (fewer contracts per kW of capacity), and more inclusive than behind-the-meter solar.</p>
<p>Utilities, especially investor-owned utilities, aren't in love with it (to them it's just a more expensive version of a solar plant), but if they get their act together, they can use small, strategically sited shared solar projects to ease grid congestion or avoid expensive new grid investments.</p>
<p>Here's RMI's visual on the benefits (you may have to click over to the report to read the tiny type):</p>
<p>One benefit is worth calling out in particular: Shared solar can help low-income customers get in on the solar craze.</p>
<p>Rooftop solar can be expensive, even with incentives or leasing programs, leaving low-income ratepayers out. Shared solar can let them in on the benefits of solar. A couple of recent reports show how.</p>
<p>One is the <a href="http://www.lowincomesolar.org/about-this-guide/" type="external">"Low-Income Solar Policy Guide,"</a> from a coalition of groups including GRID Alternatives, Vote Solar, and the Center for Social Inclusion. The other is from the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC): <a href="http://www.irecusa.org/publications/shared-renewable-energy-for-low-to-moderate-income-consumers-policy-guidelines-and-model-provisions/" type="external">"Shared Renewable Energy for Low- to Moderate-Income Consumers: Policy Guidelines and Model Provisions."</a></p>
<p>Both get into the technical weeds on program design and financing. I will spare you the gory details; the take-home message is that there are a variety of tools available to policymakers, utilities, and developers to ensure that low-income communities benefit from shared solar.</p>
<p>Shared solar still faces all kinds of barriers, both regulatory and in the form of "soft costs" ? customer acquisition, permitting, managing, billing, that sort of stuff.</p>
<p>There are also concerns about whether the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will treat shared-solar investments as securities, which could trigger all sorts of problems, but I'll spare you those gory details as well. It's being hashed out. (The <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy15osti/63892.pdf" type="external">NREL report</a> has much more on that issue.)</p>
<p>Over time, as the market matures and the popularity of shared solar spreads, more states will adopt friendly regulations. The administrative aspects will become more standardized and easier to adapt to local circumstances. And growth will accelerate.</p>
<p>Every analyst and market watcher agrees: Shared solar is heading for a boom. It may take a while, but sooner or later every American will be able to buy some solar power of their very own.</p></article>
<article id="0000667" published-at="2015-06-01" title="A California resident says Google's autonomous cars &quot;drive like your grandma&quot;"><p>Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-latest-chapter-for-self-driving-car.html" type="external">has been testing its self-driving cars</a> all over Mountain View, California ? which means that a handful of drivers have already gotten a firsthand look at what it's like to share the road with them.</p>
<p>Recently, an anonymous reader <a href="http://www.wearobo.com/2015/05/californians-are-ok-with-google-self.html" type="external">of the blog Emerging Technologies</a> shared what it's like to deal with these cars in traffic. Here are a handful of the most interesting observations:</p>
<p>1) People in Mountain View are totally used to Google's cars.</p>
<p>The reader estimated seeing at least five of the cars daily.</p>
<p>"Other drivers don't even blink when they see one," the author wrote. "Neither do pedestrians ? there's no "fear" from the general public about crashing or getting run over, at least not as far as I can tell."</p>
<p></p>
<p>2) Google's cars drive really, really cautiously.</p>
<p>"Google cars drive like your grandma ? they're never the first off the line at a stop light, they don't accelerate quickly, they don't speed, and they never take any chances with lane changes (cut people off, etc.)," the author wrote.</p>
<p>The author described a Google car's behavior when making a turn at a stop sign with little visibility to the left or right: it inches out very gradually, with lots of halting pauses, rather than just slowly gliding forward into traffic as most human drivers tend to do.</p>
<p>Similarly, the autonomous cars are extremely courteous with pedestrians, waiting a few seconds after they've completely cleared a crosswalk before inching out to make a turn through it. All this caution actually leads human drivers to occasionally get annoyed at Google cars, as they can excessively slow down traffic.</p>
<p>3) Human drivers might take advantage of these self-driving cars.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One of the author's more interesting observations is what happened after he or she intentionally cut off the Google car as an experiment:</p>
<p>"The car handled it perfectly (maybe too perfectly). It slowed down and let me in," the author wrote. "Honestly, I don't think it will take long for other drivers to realize that self-driving cars are 'easy targets' in traffic."</p>
<p>In other words, drivers will realize that a self-driving car won't try to squeeze you out, tailgate you, or otherwise react angrily if you cut it off. Ultimately, this could lead human drivers to take advantage ? perhaps going ahead of their turn at four-way stops, or merging into the front of a long line of stopped highway traffic because they know a self-driving car will let them in.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/24/8489881/ford-mike-tinskey-electric-vehicles-infrastructure-interview" type="external">recent interview with The Verge</a>, Ford executive Mike Tinskey noted that these sorts of situations might actually make it useful for humans to have the ability to occasionally take control:</p>
<p>If you?ve ever had the pleasure to go to, for instance, China, if you?re not aggressive to try to turn left, there will be people that will walk in front of you all day long. And an autonomous vehicle would end up sitting there forever. And a driver normally just has to kind of say, "Alright, I?m going," and the people will stop and the car heads through. So there are going to be situations where a remote driver can actually pilot a vehicle better than an autonomous in certain conditions.</p>
<p>4) Google's cars seem really safe.</p>
<p>"Overall, I would say that I'm impressed with how these things operate. I actually do feel safer around a self-driving car than most other California drivers," the blog post author wrote.</p>
<p>This fits in with the data we have on the cars so far. Though they've been involved in <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/11/8586661/google-self-driving-car-11-accidents-not-at-fault" type="external">11 minor fender benders</a> over the course of more than 700,000 miles of travel, none of them were actually the cars' fault ? and in fact, <a href="https://medium.com/backchannel/the-view-from-the-front-seat-of-the-google-self-driving-car-46fc9f3e6088" type="external">Google has detailed many situations</a> in which its cars managed to avoid accidents after human drivers made extremely unsafe errors, like driving on the wrong side of the highway.</p>
<p>So far, at least, Google has smartly prioritized excessively safe travel instead of designing its cars to have human-like aggressiveness. It'll be interesting to see how this works if the cars spread beyond Mountain View.</p>

<article id="0000671" published-at="2009-03-25" title="Obama defends his agenda while seeking accord"><p>Caption</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>President Obama tried to rally the nation behind his ambitious agenda on Tuesday night, hoping to channel outrage at Wall Street excess into support for changes in tax, health care and energy policy that face skepticism within his own party in Congress.</p>
<p>Even as balky <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Democrats%22" type="external">Democrats</a> began carving some of the signature proposals out of his budget, Obama suggested he could compromise in the short term on a middle-class tax cut and a cap on carbon emissions. But he indicated that he would stand firm on four top priorities, insisting that Congress make progress in those areas.</p>
<p>"We never expected when we printed out our budget that they would simply Xerox it and vote on it," Obama said at the second prime-time news conference of his administration, signaling flexibility on the details as long as his central goals were met. "The bottom line is, I want to see health care, energy, <a href="" type="internal">education</a> and serious efforts to reduce our <a href="" type="internal">budget deficit</a>."</p>
<p>The news conference came at a volatile moment for the new president as he sought to deflect strong Republican opposition and quell Democratic misgivings over his plans, while reassuring voters that he could solve the economic crisis that has gripped the country for more than a year.</p>
<p>"We are beginning to see signs of progress," he said, calling for "a renewed confidence that a better day will come."</p>
<p><a href="" type="internal">Obama's</a> nationally televised appearance came the day before he plans to travel to Capitol Hill to meet with Senate Democrats, who spent Tuesday paring back his spending plans. He tried to smooth over the differences, suggesting it was just a matter of details.</p>
<p>At the same time, he fired back at Republicans who have been criticizing the big deficit numbers in his plan, accusing them of having a "short memory" after the growth of the federal debt under his predecessor, <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22George+W.+Bush%22" type="external">George W. Bush</a>.</p>
<p>He also tried to turn the corner on the uproar over $165 million in bonuses paid last week by American International Group to employees in the same division that helped set off the near collapse that required taxpayers to bail it out.</p>
<p>"I'm as angry as anybody about those bonuses," he said, adding that executives needed to learn that "enriching themselves on the taxpayers' dime is inexcusable." But he added, "At the same time the rest of us can't afford to demonize every investor or entrepreneur who seeks to make a profit."</p>
<p>Pressed on why he did not immediately express outrage about the AIG bonuses, Obama replied, "Well, it took us a couple of days because I like to know what I'm talking about before I speak."</p>
<p>Asked about race, a subject he rarely addresses publicly, Obama, the nation's first African American president, said the economic situation means that his main task has nothing to do with color. The country experienced "justifiable pride" at his inauguration, the culmination of a long journey in a society long divided by race, he said.</p>
<p>"But that lasted about a day," Obama said. "Right now the American people are judging me exactly the way I should be judged and that is, are we taking the steps to improve liquidity in the financial markets, create jobs, keep business open and keep America safe?"</p>
<p>The comments about his budget suggested the parameters of Obama's negotiating position as Congress dives deeper into the legislation. Although he defended the middle-class tax cut and the market-based carbon cap he included in the 10-year spending plan, he indicated that neither necessarily had to be in the final version passed by Congress because he could pursue them independently.</p>
<p>He noted that the $787 billion stimulus plan already passed by Congress authorized the $400-per-person tax credit for most workers for two years, so he has time to find ways to finance that permanently. And he suggested that Congress could take steps toward encouraging clean energy in the spending plan even as committees work separately to structure a so-called cap-and-trade system that could be passed at another point.</p>
<p>The news conference was the latest in a blitz of public appearances, some more unconventional than others, as Obama tries to invest his personal popularity in a program facing headwinds in the capital. Last week, he conducted a town-hall-style meeting in California, went on ESPN to give his college basketball picks, became the first sitting president to appear on "The Tonight Show" and gave an interview to "60 Minutes."</p></article>

Longshore workers and college students joined in the effort with celebrities such as <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics%2Fjoegarofoli&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Whoopi+Goldberg%22" type="external">Whoopi Goldberg</a> and politicians including a Republican governor, <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics%2Fjoegarofoli&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22George+Deukmejian%22" type="external">George Deukmejian</a>.</p>
<p>Longtime Rep. <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics%2Fjoegarofoli&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Ron+Dellums%22" type="external">Ron Dellums</a> led an often-lonely fight in Congress to win federal sanctions against South Africa. When he was lieutenant governor, <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics%2Fjoegarofoli&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Leo+McCarthy%22" type="external">Leo McCarthy</a> was arrested at an antiapartheid protest. So was the poet <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics%2Fjoegarofoli&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Maya+Angelou%22" type="external">Maya Angelou</a>.</p>
<p>In 1986, California became the largest government in the U.S. to require divestment of South Africa-related investments - $11 billion at the time. Deukmejian endorsed the move.</p>
<p>"In apartheid, we saw the epitome of evil," said <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics%2Fjoegarofoli&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Pedro+Noguera%22" type="external">Pedro Noguera</a>, who was UC Berkeley's student body president in 1985, leading protests and being arrested at antiapartheid demonstrations on campus.</p>
<p>Now a professor of education at <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics%2Fjoegarofoli&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22New+York+University%22" type="external">New York University</a>, Noguera said, "People who are for progressive causes are often used to losing. But they can point to this one and say, 'We won.'</p>
<p>"Mandela was more of a mythic figure at that point," Noguera said. "He was more of an inspirational symbol to us."</p>
<p>Antiapartheid protests were staged at hundreds of campuses nationwide in the 1980s, and the ones at UC Berkeley were among the most powerful.</p>
<p>In April 1985, 10,000 students boycotted classes a day after police arrested 159 people during a Sproul Plaza protest.</p>
<p>When the university announced in 1986 that it would divest $3.1 billion from companies doing business in South Africa, "you felt that you were part of something that made the world different," said Assemblywoman <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics%2Fjoegarofoli&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Nancy+Skinner%22" type="external">Nancy Skinner</a>, D-Berkeley, who helped organize the UC Berkeley protests.</p>
<p>Mandela was impressed when members of the <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics%2Fjoegarofoli&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22International+Longshore+and+Warehouse+Union%22" type="external">International Longshore and Warehouse Union</a> in San Francisco refused to unload the South African cargo ship Nedlloyd Kimberley in 1984. Mandela praised the union workers during his 1990 speech at the Coliseum, saying, "They established themselves as the front line of the antiapartheid movement in the Bay Area."</p>
<p>"It was electric when he said that," said <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics%2Fjoegarofoli&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Lawrence+Thibeaux%22" type="external">Lawrence Thibeaux</a>, who sat in the fifth row as Mandela spoke. He recalled being on the dock as the union's business agent when workers refused to unload the cargo.</p>
<p>"Fifty percent of our membership was black," Thibeaux said. "To keep unloading cargo meant we were helping their government continue their program of apartheid."</p>
<p>Seeing Mandela in person years later "showed that we had helped change things," Thibeaux said.</p>
<p>The horror of apartheid had long resonated in the black community, particularly among those who had lived through the civil rights era.

<p>"There was a hell of a connection there, a lot of identification," said Bagwell, now retired and living in San Francisco.</p>
<p>"Part of (the connection) was that the United States also was dealing with its issues of racism," said <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics%2Fjoegarofoli&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Wilson+Riles%22" type="external">Wilson Riles</a> Jr., who was a member of the <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics%2Fjoegarofoli&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Oakland+City+Council%22" type="external">Oakland City Council</a> when it divested its South African-related holdings in the mid-1980s.</p>

<article id="0000706" published-at="2017-05-11" title="Trump?s top health official got a basic fact about opioid addiction very, very wrong"><p>The nation?s top health official this week perpetuated a dangerous, even deadly myth about drug addiction ? right as the US struggles with its massive <a href="" type="internal">opioid epidemic</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking on Tuesday at an event about the drug overdose crisis ( <a href="" type="internal">the deadliest in US history</a>), Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was asked about drug treatment. ?If we?re just substituting one opioid for another, we?re not moving the dial much,? Price <a href="http://www.wvgazettemail.com/news-health/20170509/trump-officials-seek-opioid-solutions-in-wv" type="external">responded</a>. ?Folks need to be cured so they can be productive members of society and realize their dreams.?</p>
<p>Price was referring to what?s known as medication-assisted treatment. This is when a drug user takes a medication ? for opioids, typically methadone or buprenorphine ? to satiate cravings and stave off withdrawal. This allows people to then go about their lives as normal, without facing as much of a desire to use potentially dangerous drugs. There are literally decades of research behind this approach.</p>
<p>Price, however, used a common myth to denigrate the value of this treatment, arguing that taking opioids like methadone or buprenorphine to treat opioid addiction is really just substituting one opioid for another.</p>
<p>This doesn?t just go against decades of research; it also fundamentally misunderstands addiction. The issue isn?t just that someone is using drugs, but that someone is using drugs in a way that endangers them. Yet this myth has been used time and time again to deny medication-assisted treatment to opioid users ? sometimes to literally deadly results.</p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/disorders/substance-use" type="external">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>, it?s not enough for someone to be using drugs to qualify for a substance use disorder. After all, most US adults use drugs ? some every day or multiple times a day ? without any problems whatsoever. Just think about that next time you sip a beer, glass of wine, coffee, tea, or any other beverage with alcohol or caffeine in it, or any time you use a drug to treat a medical condition.</p>
<p>The qualification for a substance use disorder is that someone is using drugs in a dangerous or risky manner, putting himself or others in danger. So someone with a substance use disorder would not just be using opioids but potentially using these drugs in a way that puts him in danger ? perhaps by feeling the need to commit crimes to obtain the drugs or using the drugs so much that he puts himself at risk of overdose and inhibits his day-to-day functioning. Basically, the drug use has to hinder someone from being a healthy, functioning member of society to qualify as substance use disorder.</p>
<p>The key with medication-assisted treatment is that while it does involve continued drug use, it turns that drug use into a much safer habit. Methadone, which is typically administered in a supervised setting, and buprenorphine, which is offered in take-home doses, are both meant to supplant dangerous drug habits. When taken as prescribed, these drugs can eliminate someone?s cravings for opioids and withdrawal symptoms ? to help avoid relapse ? without producing the kind of euphoric high that heroin or traditional painkillers can.</p>
<p>Related</p>
<p>So instead of stealing to get heroin or using painkillers so much that he puts his life at risk, a patient on medication-assisted treatment can simply use methadone or buprenorphine to meet his physical cravings and otherwise go about his day ? going to school, working, whatever.</p>
<p>This isn?t just hypothetical. <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2879%2991550-2/abstract" type="external">Decades</a> of <a href="http://www.ucsf.edu/news/2000/03/5047/methadone-maintenance-found-be-more-effective-treating-heroin-addicti" type="external">research</a> have deemed medication-assisted treatment <a href="http://www.nih.gov/news/health/nov2011/nida-08a.htm" type="external">effective</a> for treating drug use disorders. The <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/idu/facts/MethadoneFin.pdf" type="external">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, <a href="http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/principles-drug-addiction-treatment-research-based-guide-third-edition/frequently-asked-questions/use-medications-methadone-buprenorphine" type="external">National Institute on Drug Abuse</a>, and <a href="http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/activities/treatment_opioid_dependence/en/" type="external">World Health Organization</a> all acknowledge its medical value. Experts often describe it to me as ?the gold standard? for opioid addiction treatment.</p>
<p>Yet the myth Price propagated has been used time and time again to restrict the use of these drugs. For example, the federal government <a href="" type="internal">currently caps</a> the number of patients for whom a doctor can prescribe buprenorphine.</p>
<p>The federal government argues that the cap is needed to ensure buprenorphine isn?t diverted to the black market for recreational use, but the myth likely plays a role in keeping the cap in place as well. Besides, restrictions on buprenorphine may lead to more diversion, because they force patients to rely on the black market to get their medications. Some research backs this up: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3449053/" type="external">A 2012 study</a> in Drug and Alcohol Dependence found that a big contributor to the diversion of buprenorphine was a lack of access to affordable buprenorphine treatments for opioid addiction.</p>
<p>There?s also evidence that these and other government restrictions on medication-assisted treatment can literally get someone killed.</p>
<p>In 2013, Judge Frank Gulotta Jr. in New York ordered an opioid user arrested for drugs, Robert Lepolszki, off methadone treatment. On January 2014, Lepolszki <a href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Methadone-Judge-Rule-Father-Blame-Lepolszki-Son-Overdose-Heroin-Addict-Ruling-I-Team-Investigation-273213211.html" type="external">died of a drug overdose</a> at 28 years old ? a direct result, Lepolszki?s parents <a href="https://psmag.com/news/how-america-overdosed-on-drug-courts" type="external">say</a>, of failing to get the medicine he needed. In his defense, Gulotta has continued arguing that methadone programs ?are crutches ? they are substitutes for drugs and drug cravings without enabling the participant to actually rid him or herself of the addiction.?</p>
<p>This is just one case, but it shows the real risk of denying opioid users treatment: It can literally get them killed by depriving them of lifesaving medical care. (After the death, Gulotta <a href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Methadone-Judge-Rule-Father-Blame-Lepolszki-Son-Overdose-Heroin-Addict-Ruling-I-Team-Investigation-273213211.html" type="external">defended</a> his position, claiming that he lets people stay on medication-assisted treatment with a doctor?s recommendation ? which Lepolszki apparently didn?t have.)</p>
<p>There has been some movement away from this mentality in recent years, as Price?s predecessor, former Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell, sought to relax restrictions on medication-assisted treatment. She <a href="" type="internal">raised the cap</a> on buprenorphine. Under her leadership, the Obama administration also <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/29/fact-sheet-obama-administration-announces-additional-actions-address" type="external">unlocked more funding</a> for medication-assisted treatment. And with support from her and President Barack Obama, Congress <a href="" type="internal">passed a law</a> that, in part, allocated hundreds of millions of dollars that could potentially go to funding more medication-assisted treatment.</p>
<p>Drug policy experts <a href="" type="internal">widely agree</a> that more of this kind of action is needed ? to unlock not just more medication-assisted treatment, but also more drug treatment and prevention in general. According to <a href="https://addiction.surgeongeneral.gov/" type="external">a 2016 report by the surgeon general</a>, just 10 percent of the people with a drug use disorder obtain specialty treatment. The report found that the low rate was largely explained by a shortage of treatment options, including medication-assisted treatment.</p>
<p>Yet Price, by repeating one of the most dangerous myths about medication-assisted treatment, has suggested that the Trump administration may move in another ? and, frankly, deadly ? direction.</p></article>
<article id="0000708" published-at="2006-12-19" title="Pelosi seeks input from diverse array of confidants"><p>Caption</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>2006-12-19 04:00:00 PDT Washington -- All eyes in the capital are fixed on Rep. <a href="" type="internal">Nancy Pelosi</a> of San Francisco as she prepares to be sworn in Jan. 4 as the nation's first female House speaker. But less notice has been paid to the lawmakers, lobbyists, aides, business leaders and friends who will be whispering in her ear as she leads a new Democratic Congress.</p>
<p>Among the group: a pioneering Silicon Valley investment banker; a San Francisco politician with a penchant for expressing himself in four-letter words; and a 32-year veteran of Congress from the East Bay whom President Bush dubbed "Big George."</p>
<p>Financier <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Bill+Hambrecht%22" type="external">Bill Hambrecht</a>, former state Senate leader <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22John+Burton%22" type="external">John Burton</a> and Democratic Rep. George Miller of Martinez are just a few of the insiders who make up House Speaker-to-be Pelosi's circle of advisers and confidants.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the list includes many of the Bay Area's best-known power brokers, from former San Francisco Mayor <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Willie+Brown%22" type="external">Willie Brown</a> to California Sen. <a href="" type="internal">Barbara Boxer</a> to Rep. <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Anna+Eshoo%22" type="external">Anna Eshoo</a> of Palo Alto, who is one of Pelosi's closest friends in Congress.</p>
<p>"We've known each other for 30 years," said Eshoo, who met Pelosi at a party fundraiser at the Atherton home of <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Madeleine+Haas+Russell%22" type="external">Madeleine Haas Russell</a>. "It was long before either of us were elected to Congress. ... We were mothers; we were both involved in the community and in the <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Democratic+Party%22" type="external">Democratic Party</a>. We had many commonalities."</p>
<p>Pelosi's circle is filled with Silicon Valley heavyweights. She has long-standing ties to investment banker <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Sandy+Robertson%22" type="external">Sandy Robertson</a> and venture capitalists <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Tom+Perkins%22" type="external">Tom Perkins</a> and <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22John+Doerr%22" type="external">John Doerr</a>. More recently, she befriended Google founders <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Larry+Page%22" type="external">Larry Page</a> and Sergey Brin, as well as Cisco Systems CEO <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22John+Chambers%22" type="external">John Chambers</a>, an ally and major donor to Republican President Bush.</p>
<p>Her friends say no list of advisers is complete without including her family. Her husband, Paul, eschews a public role, but is a key counselor and confidant. Her older brother, <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Thomas+D%27Alesandro+III%22" type="external">Thomas D'Alesandro III</a>, a former Baltimore mayor, acts as a sounding board.</p>
<p>Her daughter Christine, a former chief of staff to Massachusetts Rep. <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22John+Tierney%22" type="external">John Tierney</a> and an elected member of the <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Democratic+National+Committee%22" type="external">Democratic National Committee</a>, often travels with Pelosi and offers strategic advice. Pelosi's daughter Alexandra, who covered Bush for an HBO documentary in the 2000 campaign, gives practical advice on handling the media. And son Paul and two other daughters, Nancy Corinne and Jacqueline, and their families also provide a deep well of emotional support.</p>
<p>"It's such a close family," said San Francisco Mayor <a href="" type="internal">Gavin Newsom</a>, who has long been tight with the Pelosi clan. "Her daughters are remarkably influential with her, and so is Paul -- the son and the husband."</p>
<p><a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Christine+Pelosi%22" type="external">Christine Pelosi</a>, Newsom added, "is a great tactician. Her commitment to her mother is remarkable."</p>
<p>Pelosi also relies heavily on her staff -- longtime aides and the many new staffers who were hired from the offices of other top <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Democrats%22" type="external">Democrats</a> when she stepped into her role as the party's House minority leader in 2002.</p>
<p>Pelosi is well-known for placing a premium on loyalty. The lawmakers in Washington who are closest to her are those who have served with her since she was first elected in 1987 -- especially those who have proved their allegiance by backing her campaigns for a top spot in the Democratic leadership.</p>
<p>Many inside the Beltway were surprised when Pelosi supported Rep. <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22John+Murtha%22" type="external">John Murtha</a>, an ex-Marine from Pennsylvania, last month in his failed bid for Democratic majority leader, the second-most-powerful position in the House. But Murtha had managed Pelosi's successful campaigns for <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22House+Democratic%22" type="external">House Democratic</a> whip in 2001 and for minority leader in 2002. Her support was aimed at repaying him for his loyalty.</p>
<p>Her top lieutenant in Congress is Miller, who used his clout to help her win a spot in the leadership and remains one of her most trusted advisers. She installed him as co-chair of the <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Democratic+Steering+and+Policy+Committee%22" type="external">Democratic Steering and Policy Committee</a>, which shapes the party's agenda. Some Democrats say he persuaded Pelosi to throw her weight behind Murtha, though Miller denies he has such influence.</p>
<p>"To say that is to not understand Ms. Pelosi," he said in an interview last week. "She makes her own decisions."</p>
<p>But many lawmakers have felt Miller's bear-claw grip on their shoulders during key votes on the House floor, reminding them that Pelosi needs their support.</p>
<p>"George is immensely influential with Nancy, and vice versa," said Rep. <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Ellen+Tauscher%22" type="external">Ellen Tauscher</a>, D-Walnut Creek. "Many people go to George because of the fact that Nancy has tremendous time constraints on her. They use George as a conduit to her."</p>
<p>Many of Pelosi's friendships in Washington were forged over Tuesday night dinners with a small clique of fellow lawmakers. <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Tom+Downey%22" type="external">Tom Downey</a>, a former congressman from Long Island who is now a lobbyist in Washington, hosted many of the meals at his row house on D Street on Capitol Hill. Those meals included Pelosi, Miller and several House members -- Boxer, <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Dick+Durbin%22" type="external">Dick Durbin</a> of Illinois and <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Chuck+Schumer%22" type="external">Chuck Schumer</a> of New York -- who are now senators.</p>
<p>Over bottles of California wine, ravioli and antipasti, the group talked politics and shared stories about their families. Other Californians -- including Eshoo, former Rep. <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Leon+Panetta%22" type="external">Leon Panetta</a> of Monterey and Rep. <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Sam+Farr%22" type="external">Sam Farr</a> of <a href="" type="internal">Carmel</a> -- sometimes joined in. Boxer and Pelosi were at one of the dinners when the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake hit.</p>
<p>"Nancy and Barbara were naturally worried because their husbands and family members were all at the (World Series) game," Downey recalled. "I had a big satellite dish at the time, and we were able to get the San Francisco news feeds to see what was going on."</p>
<p>The Tuesday night dinner gang still gets together -- Boxer organizes it every month or so, often at the restaurant Marty's American Bar &amp;amp; Grill on Capitol Hill -- and its members remain close Pelosi advisers: <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Marty+Russo%22" type="external">Marty Russo</a>, a former Illinois lawmaker who now heads the powerhouse lobbying firm Cassidy &amp;amp; Associates, and <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Sam+Gejdenson%22" type="external">Sam Gejdenson</a>, a former Connecticut lawmaker. Boxer is Pelosi's fiercest defender and supporter in the Senate.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, Pelosi's friends and allies concede that one adviser stands head and shoulders above the rest: John Burton, the tart-tongued liberal famous for championing the cause of the poor, elderly and homeless in Sacramento and as a House member in Washington. His sister-in-law, the late Rep. Sala Burton, wife of legendary San Francisco Rep. Phil Burton, summoned Pelosi to her deathbed to urge her to run for Congress.</p>
<p>Burton downplays his influence with the future speaker. "When she comes back home, she'll call and we'll go to lunch and just chat. If I've got something to say, I'll call her," he said.</p>
<p>"Sometimes I'll have an idea -- just an idea about something -- so I might say, 'What do you think about this?' But trust me, she knows what the hell she's doing. It's in her blood."</p>
<p>Pelosi's political network in the Bay Area reaches far and wide, including former Lt.

She remains close with much of the state's Democratic establishment from her days as party chairwoman in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>Her Rolodex of personal friends also is peppered with top donors to the Democratic Party, including Susie Tompkins Buell, co-founder of the Esprit clothing company; former ambassador to <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Luxembourg+James+Hormel%22" type="external">Luxembourg James Hormel</a>; Bay Area attorneys <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22John+Keker%22" type="external">John Keker</a> and Joe Cotchett; financier <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Warren+Hellman%22" type="external">Warren Hellman</a>; and members of the Haas, Fisher, Getty and Swig families. Her well-heeled fundraising base has helped propel her to power.</p>
<p>The reality, according to Burton, is that Pelosi has too many friends and allies in the Bay Area to name. A recent holiday party Pelosi hosted in San Francisco to thank her supporters and celebrate her rise in Congress started with a guest list of 400. More than 1,000 people showed up.</p>
<p>"She doesn't have a close circle, she has an ever-widening circle," Burton said. "Her friends go from the cream of the crop down to the average working stiffs. She covers the whole gamut."</p>
<p>House Speaker-to-be Nancy Pelosi turns to a wide network of friends and allies for advice -- to fellow Democratic lawmakers on key policy topics, to her top aides for political advice, to San Franciscans for donations and help with shared causes, and to her family for emotional support as she takes over the House's top job. Here are just a few of them:</p>
<p></p>
<p>House Democratic allies</p>
<p>Rep. George Miller of Martinez: "Big George," as President Bush dubbed him, is a top lieutenant, a close friend and a key adviser on politics and policy.</p>
<p>Rep. Anna Eshoo: The Palo Alto lawmaker is a friend of 30 years, a constant presence at Pelosi's side and a bridge to entrepreneurs and donors in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Rep. John Murtha of Pennsylvania: The ex-Marine vaulted into public consciousness in November 2005 when he turned against the president's Iraq war policy. Murtha ran Pelosi's campaigns for minority whip and minority leader, and she has stayed loyal to him -- some say to a fault.</p>
<p>Rep. John Spratt: The South Carolina lawmaker will chair the Budget Committee and is Pelosi's link to many conservative and Southern Democrats.</p>
<p>Rep. Rahm Emanuel: The former White House aide to President Bill Clinton, who ran the House Democrats' winning campaign this fall, talked to Pelosi as often as six times a day about where and how to spend the party's campaign money.</p>
<p>Rep. David Obey: The Wisconsin appropriator and old-school liberal will be Pelosi's ally in shaping the party's spending priorities.</p>
<p>Rep. Ike Skelton: the Missouri Democrat who will chair Armed Services voted for the Iraq war and has been one of Pelosi's go-to guys on military matters.</p>
<p>Rep. Charlie Rangel: the New York Democrat and soon-to-be chair of Ways and Means stuck together with Pelosi to sink Bush's Social Security plan.</p>
<p>Noteworthy: Henry Waxman of Los Angeles, the Democrats' fiercest investigator; Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, Pelosi's choice to lead the Democratic Steering Committee; James Clyburn, the highest ranking African American in her leadership team; Howard Berman and Zoe Lofgren, of North Hollywood and San Jose respectively, who fought along side Pelosi against Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's ballot measure that would have allowed retired judges to redraw congressional districts in California.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Senate friends</p>
<p>Sen. Harry Reid: the incoming Senate Majority Leader struck up a close alliance with Pelosi while battling Bush and GOP leaders in Congress.</p>
<p>Sen. Barbara Boxer: one of her oldest friends in Congress from their days as House members from California.</p>
<p>Sen. Dick Durbin: a former House member from Illinois, he was part of a regular Tuesday dinner with Pelosi, Boxer and others. Now he's the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate.</p>
<p>Sen. Chuck Schumer: the New York Democrat is a longtime personal friend, and now shares a Capitol row house with her allies, Durbin and George Miller.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ex-members of Congress -- a.k.a. the lobbyists</p>
<p>Tom Downey: former Long Island lawmaker and now powerful Democratic lobbyist knows Pelosi well enough that his kids call her "Aunt Nancy."</p>
<p>Marty Russo: a former House member from Illinois was part of Pelosi's Tuesday night dinner club; he's now CEO of Cassidy &amp;amp; Associates, one of D.C.'s top firms for securing earmarks.</p>
<p>George Crawford: Pelosi's former chief of staff, now a lobbyist at King &amp;amp; Spalding; he's raised eyebrows for taking two new clients, ExxonMobil and pharmaceutical giant Amgen, who will face tough scrutiny under a Pelosi-run House.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Top aides</p>
<p>John Lawrence: chief of staff of Pelosi's leadership office, who spent 30 years as a top aide to Rep. George Miller.</p>
<p>Terri McCullough: runs Pelosi's personal office in Washington and is married to Howard Wolfson, one of Sen. Hillary Clinton's top political advisers.</p>
<p>Dan Bernal: Pelosi's district director, the political fixer for all San Francisco matters.</p>
<p><a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22George+Kundanis%22" type="external">George Kundanis</a>: the deputy chief of staff, an aide to former Rep. Dick Gephardt, he's responsible for House legislative floor strategy.</p>
<p>Lorraine Miller: director of intergovernmental relations, she deals with the White House and is a key liaison for Pelosi to the Congressional Black Caucus; she also heads the District of Columbia chapter of the NAACP.</p>
<p>Dean Aguillen: the director of new member services, he's responsible for helping vulnerable Democrats.</p>
<p>Brian Wolff: Pelosi's guy at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, he's raised millions for Democrats and worked for the Clintons.</p>
<p>Brendan Daly: Pelosi's communications director, crafts Pelosi's daily messages and handles the media along with press aide Jennifer Crider.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Silicon Valley gurus</p>
<p>Bill Hambrecht: a Silicon Valley investment banker who founded Hambrecht &amp;amp; Quist, and major Democratic donor, he and his family have taken ski trips with the Pelosis.</p>
<p>Sandy Robertson: founder of the West Coast investment bank Robertson, Stephens &amp;amp; Co., he's been a financial backer and adviser on economic matters.</p>
<p>John Chambers: the president and CEO of Cisco Systems has hosted fundraisers for the Republican president, but Pelosi has reached out to him for input on business issues.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Family</p>
<p>Paul Pelosi: met his wife in Washington when both took a class at Georgetown University (she was a student at nearby Trinity <a href="" type="internal">College</a>). He has made a fortune in <a href="" type="internal">real estate</a>.</p>
<p>Christine Pelosi: the most political of Pelosi's five children, she often travels with her mother on the campaign trail and directs a union-backed boot camp to train Democratic candidates.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Friends and donors</p>
<p>Roselyne "Cissie" Swig: a longtime friend, donor and Pacific Heights neighbor, Swig is also a policy buff who share's Pelosi's concern for the environment, women's rights and defending Israel.</p>
<p>Susie Tompkins Buell: the co-founder of the Esprit clothing company and a major Democratic donor, they share a passion for politics and supporting female candidates.</p>
<p>John Keker: the San Francisco trial lawyer and his wife, Tina, have been generous contributors to Pelosi's campaigns and political action committees.</p>
<p>Richard Goldman: the lifelong San Franciscan and philanthropist is registered as a Republican, but has been a close friend and backer of Pelosi. He and his late wife, Rhoda, founded the Goldman Environmental Prize.</p></article>

<article id="0000721" published-at="2017-07-07" title="What?s Wrong with Trump?s Tweets?"><p>President Trump?s latest spate of vitriolic <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/29/trump-attacks-morning-joe-anchors-in-personal-tweets.html" type="external">tweets</a> about Morning Joe co-hosts, ?Psycho Joe? (Joe Scarborough) and ?low IQ crazy Mika? (Mika Brzezinski), have once again drawn the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/29/politics/lawmakers-react-trump-tweet-joe-scarborough-mika-brzezinski-morning-joe/index.html" type="external">ire</a> of legislators on both sides of the aisle. House Speaker Paul Ryan characterized the tweets as inappropriate, lamenting that they didn?t help to ?improve the tone? and ?the civility of the debate.? Similarly, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi asserted that the tweets ?set a low standard for public officials in terms of their demeanor.? Yet the crux of the issue with the president?s tweets remains largely overlooked?much more than his tone and demeanor, it?s his regular aimlessness that?s worth criticizing.</p>
<p>As the first lady once <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/melania-spokeswoman-when-attacked-trump-will-punch-back-10-times-harder/article/2627425" type="external">said</a>, whenever the president is attacked, he strikes back ?ten times harder,? and anyone caught in his daily flood of tweets knows that she isn?t exaggerating. But the president?s tweets don?t provoke outrage merely because they?re colorful. The issue is that they?re often directed at inappropriate targets. For example, when Ronald Reagan described former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi as ?the mad dog of the Middle East,? few bothered to yowl about his lack of decorum. Likewise, when Trump, in the wake of the Manchester bombing, labeled the terrorists as ? <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/manchester-concert-explosion/manchester-arena-suicide-attack-trump-calls-terrorists-evil-losers-n763421" type="external">evil losers</a>,? the level of outrage at his wording was noticeably lower than usual.</p>
<p>It?s no accident that people don?t mind coarse language when it?s used to debase America?s enemies. If the president brandished his characteristic tone and demeanor only for that stately purpose, none but rhetorical prudes would denounce the crudeness of his tweets. Unfortunately, Trump has devoted inordinate amounts of energy to mock and deride celebrities <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html?_r=1" type="external">ranging</a> from Megyn Kelly and Samuel L. Jackson to Ronda Rousey and Snoop Dogg.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the president?s lack of aim doesn?t mean that he should be admonished for putting rhetorical color to use. Hyperbole, profanity, and vulgarity are efficient tools. In Aristotle?s Rhetoric, he <a href="http://homepage.cs.uri.edu/courses/fall2007/csc305/Schedule/rhetoric/rhet37.htm" type="external">advises</a> aspiring orators to ?employ the language of anger in speaking of outrage? and ?the language of disgust and discreet reluctance to utter a word when speaking of impiety or foulness,? because doing so increases a speech?s persuasive power. These notions aren?t alien to Trump. In The Art of the Deal he <a href="http://www.wordsbloom.com/uploads/files/trump%20the%20art%20of%20the%20deal%20donald%20j%20(1).pdf" type="external">writes</a>, ?A little hyperbole never hurts?.It?s an innocent form of exaggeration???and a very effective form of promotion.?</p>
<p>Aristotle and the president have the right idea. History is replete with significant figures who unsheathed garishly colorful language to great effect: Christ <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+27&amp;amp;version=KJV" type="external">pegged</a> the Pharisees as folk who ?love the uppermost rooms at feasts? and ?the children of them which killed the prophets? before marking them all as a ?generation of vipers.? In a less eloquent, but equally effective lambaste, Martin Luther <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=rl0JAAAAQAAJ" type="external">styled</a> Henry VIII, King of England, as ?a pig, an ass, a dunghill, the spawn of an adder, a basilisk, a lying buffoon? and ?a mad fool with a frothy mouth.? Compared to either, Trump is a mere amateur at doling out verbal abuse.</p>
<p>Yet Trump isn?t entirely to blame for his poor choice in targets. The president, being a former entertainer, knows that his philippics will fall flat if his audience can?t grasp a crucial reference or allusion, so he makes frequent use of those figures that Americans easily recognize: actors, athletes, and TV news anchors?figures that hold an unduly large proportion of America?s national attention. If the average American knew the names of the thousands of peoples and groups that have nothing but a violent contempt for America and the American way, Trump would undoubtedly spend more of his time tweeting out hourly invectives against them instead of TV hosts (terrorists and tyrants make for easier targets). To a limited extent, the president?s choice to focus his vitriol on celebrities reflects the average American?s tragic ignorance of the people who actually threaten our national welfare.</p>
<p>Until Trump takes better aim or American culture changes dramatically, he will continue not only to stoke bipartisan outrage, but he?ll persist in destroying his reputation among that fast-diminishing, politically unaffiliated segment of the American population. These Americans hoped and imagined that the president would become capable of prioritizing threats to national well-being over petty squabbles. When 2020 rolls around corner, they?ll take their insights to the polls.</p>

<article id="0000723" published-at="2012-10-24" title="Sewer discretion is advised: Explorers find hidden wonders in urban waterways"><p>Most urban streams and creeks are hidden from sight ? in huge sewer tunnels under streets and expressways, in concrete ditches behind razor-wire fences, and sometimes even in pipes under the manicured lawns and gardens of city parks.</p>
<p>These are hardly the kinds of places you?d see on the cover of an L.L. Bean catalog ? although you might find a few L.L. Bean catalogs in these concrete creeks.</p>
<p>But a growing network of urban explorers, who sometimes call themselves ?drainers,? are sneaking into the storm sewers and aqueducts to rediscover these long-hidden waterways. They?re finding lush forest groves among the concrete ditches and waterfalls and grand vaulted grottoes in underground sewers. <a href="http://sleepycity.net/tags/sewers" type="external">Their photography and field notes</a> remind residents that the rivers and streams that nursed their cities? early growth still survive below the pavement, and are still worthy of appreciation ? maybe even restoration.</p>
<p>Now, not one, but two new documentary films follow this small subculture of urban river enthusiasts, and celebrate the outsized impact of their civilly disobedient urban river expeditions.</p>
<p>The Canadian feature <a href="http://www.catbirdproductions.ca/2010/04/22/lostrivers/" type="external">Lost Rivers</a> premiered earlier this month at Toronto?s <a href="http://planetinfocus.org/" type="external">Planet in Focus Festival</a>. It follows drainers in cities from Yonkers, N.Y., to Seoul, South Korea, and threads together small narratives about how river explorers, with varying degrees of official support, are drawing public attention to urban rivers and promoting ambitious visions for their restoration. Here?s the trailer:</p>
<p>In Brescia, Italy, the film introduces a small cadre of drainers as they pry off manholes on dark streets. Known as the <a href="http://www.bresciaunderground.com" type="external">Associazione Brescia Underground</a>, they won recognition from the city after officials took notice of their amazing photographs of the medieval bridges and Roman-era aqueducts that existed right under the pavement. Now, with the city?s blessing, they lend out waders and lead popular guided tours into the sewers.</p>
<p>From there, Lost Rivers moves on to cities where advocates have successfully convinced their communities to unearth and restore their rivers as a way to revitalize downtrodden downtown neighborhoods.</p>
<p>In one stretch of the restored <a href="http://www.vigorousnorth.com/2009/01/cheonggyecheon.html" type="external">Cheonggyecheon stream</a> in Seoul, three broken highway abutments have been preserved to memorialize the elevated expressway that once ran overhead. ?Whenever we do new construction, we forget the previous picture,? explains professor Keeyean Hwong, a traffic engineer who advocated getting rid of the freeway for the sake of the river. ?This was a very big mistake, covering up our streams. So we have to give our education to our descendants, not to make the same mistake twice.?</p>
<p><a href="http://rocktheboatfilm.com" type="external">Rock the Boat</a>, another recent environmental documentary from California, doesn?t have the global scope or production values of Lost Rivers, but its focus on a single place ? the Los Angeles River ? allows it to navigate its story at a more relaxed pace.</p>
<p>The film begins in the waning days of the George W. Bush administration, when pro-development interests in Los Angeles County joined with the Army Corps of Engineers to claim that the L.A. River was actually not a real river anymore. Real rivers enjoy protections and obligations under the federal Clean Water Act. By redefining the L.A. River as a flood-control channel, the Corps of Engineers would conveniently sweep away protections, and preserve <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnM7mFX8D_4" type="external">a prime filming location for post-apocalyptic drag races</a>.</p>
<p>If you?ve seen the L.A. River in any of the numerous films it?s been in ( <a href="" type="internal">or in the series published here earlier this summer</a>), you know that the bureaucrats had a point: It?s paved in concrete, surrounded by a scorched landscape of freeways and warehouses. But a scrappy band of Angelino environmentalists took umbrage with the bureaucratic name switch, and went toe-to-toe with the thick-necked Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
<p>The film follows George Wolfe, a paddling enthusiast, and Heather Wylie, a whistleblowing civilian biologist with the Corps of Engineers, as they plan a peaceful protest in the form of a lighthearted ? and&amp;#160;supposedly illegal ? weekend kayaking outing on the river, from near its source in the San Fernando Valley to its mouth at the Port of Long Beach. Here?s a sneak peek at the action:</p>
<p>If you?ve heard anything about L.A.?s new riverfront parks, or about <a href="" type="internal">the city?s ambitious master plan for river restoration</a>, you?ll have some idea of what a huge impact this little paddling trip ultimately had.</p>
<p>The rivers that are featured in these films, like most of our urban waterways, still have big problems: They?re polluted and largely stuck in pipes, and the only wildlife you?re likely to see there are rats and what sewer workers refer to as <a href="http://whitefish.urbanup.com/1198804" type="external">?whitefish.?</a> They?re exactly the kinds of places that most people would like to put out of sight and out of mind ? and that?s exactly what we?ve done.</p>
<p>But the drainers we meet in these new films see something inspiring in these ditches and sewers: reminders of where our cities came from, and, with some imagination, a reminder of what our cities could become in a more sustainable future.</p></article>
<article id="0000730" title="Dana Perino Compares White House Attack On Fox to Hugo Chavez"><p>Former White House Press Secretary Dana Perino on Sunday compared last week's attempt by the White House to exclude Fox News from of a pool interview to Hugo Chavez shutting down television stations in Venezuela.</p>
<p>As NewsBuster Jeff Poor <a href="/blogs/jeff-poor/2009/10/22/escalation-administration-attempts-exclude-fox-news-white-house-pool" type="external">reported</a> Thursday, the Obama administration earlier in the day tried to shut Fox News out of an interview with pay czar Kenneth Feinberg that was to be part of a pool that the cable network would always be involved in.</p>
<p>On "Fox News Sunday," when the panel discussion turned to this subject, Perino really went after the White House for what she called conduct "unbecoming" and an impediment to our efforts to "help emerging democracies get journalists and government officials to talk to one another" (video embedded below the fold with partial transcript):</p>
<p></p>
<q>
 <p>CHRIS WALLACE, HOST: Enough. I'm tired of asking my wacky question. I want to turn to one last thing, and that is the latest chapter in the Obama White House's war on Fox News and what some people are calling the administration's Chicago way of doing business.</p>
 <p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p>
 <p>SEAN CONNERY AS JIM MALONE: He pulls a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. That's the Chicago way.</p>
 <p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p>
 <p>WALLACE: That's the Chicago way. You've got to love Sean Connery in that.</p>
 <p>Dana, the latest chapter in the Chicago way was that the administration made an effort this week to use the White House pool -- that's the -- all the five major networks -- to try to exclude Fox from interviewing pay czar Ken Feinberg.</p>
 <p>The White House now says, "Well, it was just an honest mistake." Question: When you were in the Bush White House, did you ever try to do that against CBS when they were trashing President Bush? Or do you know of any White House that's ever tried to use the White House pool to eliminate somebody, to kick somebody out?</p>
 <p>DANA PERINO, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Certainly not with the pool. I mean, there are ways to exclude doing interviews with other networks, such as what happened to Fox News about four weeks ago when President Obama did all the other networks and decided not to do this one.</p>
 <p>But you never use the pool. It's a huge no-no. And I was glad to see that the reporters in the -- in the room decided to stand up and have solidarity, because they could be next in this Chicago-style way.</p>
 <p>WALLACE: And what do you make -- it was happening as we were on the air a week ago today -- of Rahm Emanuel and David Axelrod going on other Sunday talk shows and, in effect, lecturing the mainstream media Fox is not a legitimate news organization and don't follow them?</p>
 <p>PERINO: That was a coordinated, calculated attack. It was unbecoming. And if you look at some of the coverage of what mainstream media covers when, for example, somebody like a Hugo Chavez shuts down television stations, he calls them illegitimate.</p>
 <p>Now, I'm not suggesting that this White House believes that they are going to come over here and shut down Fox News.</p>
 <p>But they are defining a narrative in their first year, and it's going to be very hard to recover from it.</p>
 <p>The best thing they could do is try to find a way to, you know, give a -- send out an olive branch, try to get this behind them and to move on.</p>
 <p>WALLACE: You were telling me earlier -- and we've only got about 45 seconds left -- that you deal with the free press in emerging democracies and you worry about the message being sent.</p>
 <p>PERINO: Every -- everyone across the world watches and listens to everything that the White House is saying.</p>
 <p>Through our State Department, we are trying to help emerging democracies get journalists and government officials to talk to one another, because freedom of the press is essential to any democracy. Believe me, they are watching this, and they have -- surely are raising questions.</p>
 <p>And the next time we go to them and say, "You want to make sure that you have reporters covering this," they'll say, "Why should we do that? You don't."</p>
 <p>WALLACE: Thank you, Dana.</p>
</q>
<p>Yes, Dana, thank you.</p> Noel Sheppard, Associate Editor of NewsBusters, passed away in March of 2014.</article>

The black and red lines show the tight correlation between home price appreciation and mortgage credit growth.

<p>America, the world?s largest deficit country, is considering a fiscal stimulus of about $800 billion. China, the largest surplus country, has announced a stimulus of $586 billion, although the effect will likely be closer to $158 billion. We calculate that deficit countries are proposing stimulus packages worth 1.7% of world GDP, while surplus countries are offering packages of 0.7% of world GDP. This pattern risks exacerbating global imbalances.</p>

<p>As our chart indicates, the U.S. budget deficit is expanding at its fastest rate in the post-war era. Obama?s proposed fiscal stimulus will add to this deficit. This aggressive fiscal response is meant to offset a sharp contraction in GDP. As our updated CGS indicators package shows (see right hand column), the 3.8% fall in the fourth quarter is unlikely to mark the end of the downturn.</p>

<p>Financial stocks plunged this week, renewing the debate over how to fix the banking system. The Treasury?s remaining $350 billion in TARP funds would be enough to buy the existing common equity of the U.S. banking system, but buying existing stock wouldn?t provide the banks with new capital. To fix the banks, the Obama administration must select from a range of options that include capital injections, asset purchases, a ?bad bank?, or nationalization.</p>

<p>In what Russia claims to be a purely commercial dispute, Gazprom cut off gas to Ukraine, disrupting supplies across Europe. However, some suggest that Russia?s real aim is to exploit European dependence on Russian gas (see chart) in order to divide Europe and undermine its pro-Western neighbor. The following articles discuss the geopolitical implications of Europe?s dependence on Russian gas.</p>

<p>The experience of the 1997-98 East Asian crisis encouraged many developing countries to accumulate vast sums of foreign exchange reserves in order to self-insure against future crises. As our chart indicates, as of the end of November, emerging market countries were burning through these reserves. This crisis will put to test previous thoughts about necessary reserve levels and the efficacy of self-insurance.</p>

<p>It has been an astonishing year for the world economy. Housing prices have declined sharply, major financial institutions have failed leading to massive government bailouts, inflation fears have given way to concerns of deflation, and forward looking measures indicate that conditions will deteriorate further.

<p>The economic crisis has shrunk the holiday season, which typically lasts for about 35 days. Happy regions-those in which real estate markets have held up relatively well-have seen their holiday season decline by 10 days. Sad regions-those that have suffered a large number of foreclosures-have lost 24 days. To restore some cheer, we have collected some links that provide a lighter take on the economic crisis.</p>

<p>The World Bank is predicting a 2.1% fall in world trade for 2009, the first decline since 1982. As our chart shows, East Asian exports are slowing in tandem with Western world imports. Although G20 leaders pledged to maintain open trade at the November 15th summit, there is concern that politicians will exacerbate the problem by turning inward. Already Russia and India have raised tariffs and China is under pressure to take steps to support exports.</p>

<p>Ben Bernanke gave a speech in late 2002 discussing the risks associated with falling prices. According to bond market pricing, investors are more worried about deflation today than they were in 2002. Policymakers are debating how to respond. Standard monetary policy may be insufficient, but, as Chairman Bernanke pointed out 6 years ago, we have other somewhat untested tools to fight deflation.</p>

<p>The financial crisis has triggered a sharp expansion in government. Some commentators portray this as a paradigm shift--a shattering of the faith in free markets and small government in the U.S. But our chart shows that past recessions have also caused government to grow as a share of the economy. If the effect is more powerful this time, that is because the recession is likely to prove longer and deeper-not necessarily because of shifting paradigms.</p>

<p>There is the loss of much when we over do something. It is not as special on Christmas when we get gifts if we receive them once a month. This is the same with words. As we widen a word to cover things that it used not to include, we stretch it out of proportion, and it losses its meaning.</p>
<p>This has happened with human rights. As I have <a href="" type="internal">argued</a>, there is a problem with the way that we use the word rights. In our day, it can cover anything that you wish to do. If you want to sin and not have anyone say anything, then all you have to do is claim that it is a right.</p>

<p>Actress Scarlett Johansson says the right to abortion is not just a women?s rights issue, but also ?a human rights issue.?</p>
<p>Speaking at the 2016 Power of Women Los Angeles luncheon Johansson ? a longtime defender of Planned Parenthood ? said the abortion business ?has been under attack for many years now for?providing a safe place for legal abortions.?</p>
<p>?A women?s right to choose what to do with her body shouldn?t just be a women?s rights issue ? it?s the year 2016, and this is a human rights issue,? the actress added, reports Variety.</p>
<p>Now, the issue is that Ms. Johansson is using the term wrongly. She is addressing the issue from a statist view. She thinks because it is a supposed to be a legal practice, then it is a right. But there are two problems that she does not seem to recognize.</p>
<p>First, if being legal or illegal determines rather or not something is a right, then before the states caved over Roe v. Wade, then Abortion was not a right. We know this because it was not legal.</p>
<p>This leads us to our second problem, Johansson?s understanding of rights means they are not permanent. Not only because their legality and illegality make them real or not real, but for another reason. If human rights are derived from the state or should derive from the state, then the state can at their whim deprive who they wish of those rights.</p>
<p>All we have to do is look at our prison system to see an example of this principle. Prisoners, after being convicted, are deprived of many of their rights. They are not at liberty to come and go as they please. &amp;#160;They cannot earn and spend money. They cannot enjoy the company of their wife and family. And even when they get out, if they are felons, they&amp;#160;will live without the right to vote.</p>
<p>All because these are rights that we ?receive? from the state.</p>
<p>This is a good reason we should not listen to actors when they hand out advise.</p></article>
<article id="0000754" published-at="2016-03-15" title="Where Bernie Sanders needs to win today to truly scare Hillary Clinton"><p>Michigan's voters breathed new life into&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">Bernie Sanders's</a> campaign last week by handing the Vermont senator one of the <a href="" type="internal">biggest upsets</a> in recent presidential primary history.</p>
<p>Sanders's win in Michigan didn't just prove that he could have a shot in other big Midwestern states like Ohio and Illinois, which are&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">holding their primaries today</a>; it also helps him&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/12/us/politics/bernie-sanders.html?_r=0" type="external">tell a better story</a> about how he wins the nomination.</p>
<p>And that story itself really does matter. The perceived state of the race has an impact on how voters behave, even though it has no relationship to a candidate's positions or policies.</p>
<p>"There is such a thing as momentum. Altering perceptions of electability among voters can really be persuasive," said Adam Seth Levine, a political scientist at Cornell University.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Of course, Clinton remains the clear frontrunner. Sanders trails by more than 200 pledged delegates and has received just 3.3 million votes to the 4.9 million received by Clinton since the Iowa caucuses on February 1.</p>
<p>Will Michigan help swing the pendulum in his direction? With voters in five states headed to the ballot box on Tuesday, we'll get several excellent opportunities to find out.</p>
<p>There are five states voting today ? North Carolina, Missouri, Ohio, Florida, and Illinois. Here's a shorthand way to quickly evaluate how to interpret the returns as they come in:</p>
<p>Illinois is the most important contest to watch today. Clinton has led in most of the polling there, but there?s at least a chance that the state might deliver Sanders a dramatic, race-altering upset ? though if the victory is narrow, he won't gain much ground in delegates.</p>
<p>In Missouri and Ohio, Sanders probably needs to win to maintain a plausible path to the nomination. If he doesn't, he'll only be falling further behind Clinton in delegates at a time when he really needs to start catching up.</p>
<p>In both North Carolina and Florida, Clinton is more heavily favored to win, since these states have demographics that more closely match the states in which she's performed best. But what's really important here are the margins. The bigger Clinton's wins are here, the more her delegate lead over Sanders will likely expand.</p>
<p>Of the five states voting on Tuesday, Illinois has the most potential to dramatically transform what we know about the campaign.</p>
<p>Sanders could lose in Florida and North Carolina and still feel good about his path to the nomination. Clinton could lose in Missouri and Ohio and wake up on Wednesday about as confident as she was the day before.</p>
<p>Illinois is different. A come-from-behind win for Sanders there would really tell us something new about his strength, much as Michigan was the first sign of Sanders's appeal in the Rust Belt.</p>
<p>"If Sanders wins Illinois, we're in a new race," said Richard Berg-Andersson, who tracks delegate math at the Green Papers. "Wow, that would be a big story."</p>
<p>Of course, a Sanders upset in North Carolina or Florida ? where Clinton has dominated the polls ? would be dramatic as well.</p>
<p>But it's worth focusing on Illinois, because that's where it looks like Sanders may actually have a real shot. One <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-2016-trump-and-kasich-neck-and-neck-ohio-trump-leads-florida/" type="external">CBS poll</a> put him up by 2 points this week, and Politico reports that he's been <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/bernie-sanders-illinois-rahm-emanuel-220655" type="external">savvily turning the race</a> into something of a referendum on Chicago Mayor (and Clinton ally) Rahm Emanuel.</p>
<p>A loss in Illinois would weaken Clinton's frontrunner status for other reasons as well. The state will likely have the most black voters of the five states voting today, Clinton was raised in the suburbs of Chicago, and downstate Illinois looks much like Clinton's stronghold in the South, according to Berg-Andersson.</p>

<p>Close trackers of the race have long assumed that Clinton's delegate lead would be buttressed by big Northeastern states with diverse populations and powerful Democratic establishments ? New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey. If she loses in Illinois, those major contests will suddenly appear up for grabs.</p>
<p>Clinton has only won two states this election where white voters made up at least 70 percent of the electorate, and she only won them by razor-thin margins. (She took Iowa 49.9 to 49.6 and Massachusetts 50.1 to 48.7.)</p>
<p>If Sanders's dominance among white voters continues, he's probably most likely to win today in Ohio (where 76 percent of primary voters were white in 2008) and in Missouri (where 80 percent were white).</p>
<p></p>

<p>Though Sanders has trailed by double digits in some polls, Ohio may be fertile ground for him in part because his populist pitch on trade may resonate for the same reasons it did in Michigan, Berg-Andersson says.</p>
<p>"Everyone forgets: Ohio has almost as much auto economics as Michigan," Berg-Andersson said. "Ohio is very much like Michigan: He should be competitive there, if not win outright."</p>
<p>Missouri is tough to game out, in part because there's been very little polling to come out of the state.</p>
<p>The state's heavily white electorate is one reason to think Sanders will have an advantage. But it's not clear if white Missouri Democrats will vote like their western neighbors in Oklahoma and Nebraska (which supported Sanders), or like their eastern neighbors in Tennessee (which supported Clinton).</p>
<p>As two Southern states with diverse Democratic primary electorates, Florida and North Carolina should be right in Clinton's wheelhouse.</p>
<p>Florida is the biggest prize of all Super Tuesday II states. It should be favorable terrain for Clinton for several reasons:</p>
<p>Many of the same factors apply in North Carolina. Though there are some college towns in the state, it's hard to imagine Sanders will win there given his landslide loss in neighboring Virginia on Super Tuesday.</p>
<p>"I think Hillary will definitely win Florida and definitely North Carolina," said Seth McKee, a professor of political science at Texas Tech.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(Hal Yeager/Getty Images)</p>
<p>Still, it's important to remember here that Sanders can't afford to get blown out if he's only squeaking out victories elsewhere. Delegates in the Democratic primary are awarded proportionally, so it's important for Sanders to at least keep it close in these states if he's going to maintain a case for how he wins the nomination.</p>
<p>The problem for Sanders is that even if he has a much better than expected Super Tuesday II ? wins in Ohio, Illinois, and Missouri and narrow defeats in North Carolina and Florida ? it's unlikely to change the fundamental delegate math.</p>
<p>"Winning by a small margin isn't going to be enough for Bernie. He needs decisive victories," says Matthew Dickinson, a political science professor at Middlebury College, in an email.</p>
<p>The good news for Sanders's campaign is that there's still time. If he manages to rack up landslides in heavily white states like Wisconsin and Indiana, and get the upper hand over Clinton in those big Northeastern states and California, he could still mount a comeback.</p>
<p>But McKee doesn't think Sanders's fans should be optimistic. "Obama never had a huge lead over Hillary, but he built it over the early seven states and kept it," he said of the 2008 Democratic primary. "Hillary has done the same thing ? except her lead is larger than Obama's was."</p></article>
<article id="0000758" published-at="2006-07-17" title="American Petrocracy"><p>Few lies have wound up injuring Americans more?in everything from automobile gas tanks and winter heating bills to diminished U.S. global standing?than a rarely revisited three-year-old fib-fest involving George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, and Tony Blair. Since World War I, history is clear: the British and Americans have been pre-occupied with only one thing in Iraq?oil. Yet in 2003, as their troops again disembarked, the pretense was all about good and evil, democracy and freedom. The disastrous outcome of the unacknowledged Middle Eastern mission, the struggle for petroleum, has rarely been discussed.</p>
<p>In part, that?s because a credulous press has swallowed an extraordinary fraud. Speaking on behalf of George W. Bush, then White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer insisted in February 2003, ?If this had anything to do with oil, the position of the United States would be to lift the sanctions so the oil could flow. This is not about that. This is about saving lives by protecting the American people.? In November 2002, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had likewise declared, ?it has nothing to do with oil, literally nothing to do with oil.? On the other side of the Atlantic, British Prime Minister Tony Blair told Parliament in early 2003, ?Let me deal with the conspiracy theory that this has something to do with oil. There is no way whatever that if oil were the issue, it wouldn?t be simpler to cut a deal with Saddam Hussein.?</p>
<p>Horse manure. In the run-up to war, from Alberta to Texas, oilmen gossiped about the centrality of oil. Meetings of petroleum geologists buzzed about the so-called ?peak oil? forecast that a dangerous top in global production was only a decade or two away. Specialized publications guesstimated how much taking over Iraqi oil could mean for profits and Exxon and Chevron. Polls of ordinary citizens from Europe to Latin America and the Mideast produced similar findings: people thought the invasion was about oil.</p>
<p>The Gulf War in 1991 certainly had been. When the first President Bush went into the Persian Gulf in force that year, it was indeed about petroleum. He openly stated, ?our jobs, our way of life, our own freedom and the freedom of friendly countries around the world would all suffer if control of the world?s great oil reserves fell into the hands of Saddam Hussein.? The idea that Saddam Hussein was a second Hitler was a rhetorical embellishment. Back during the Cold War, even when Washington worried about the Soviet Union rolling into Iran and reaching the Persian Gulf, American concern arose out of the geopolitics of oil, not some abstract commitment to representative government and democracy.</p>
<p>The British had indulged their own motivational buncombe in the aftermath of the First World War when the Marquess of Curzon, Britain?s foreign secretary, said that the influence of oil in the new boundaries drawn for Iraq was ?nil.? ?Oil,? he said, ?had not the remotest connection with my attitude, or with that of His Majesty?s Government, over Mosul.? By 1924, as the British agreed to cut American oil companies in for a share of Iraq?s oil production, the centrality of oil was obvious. Curzon?s claim that London sought to bring freedom and self-government to the Arabs was mocked in Parliament and on Fleet Street.</p>
<p>But that was 80 years ago, and today?s opinion-molding elites?in the United States, at least?are far more gullible. Too many are still psychologically embedded in the hard-charging pretense that surrounded the 2003 U.S. military incursion. The revelation that Saddam?s much trumpeted weapons of mass destruction seem not to have existed has yet to lead to the next logical re-evaluation: just how much more credibility should be given to the three sweeping ?it wasn?t about oil? assurances quoted earlier? After all, if oil was involved, then the U.S. disaster in Iraq, doubly bungled, represents the greatest wartime failure since James Madison let the British burn Washington in 1814.</p>
<p>Vice President Dick Cheney, the one top official who avoided denying that oil had anything to do with the Iraq invasion, is precisely the man whose attentions must be examined to illustrate the depth of oil motivations. In 1999, when Cheney was still the head of Halliburton, the oil-services giant, he made a shrewd speech to the London Institute of Petroleum in which he gloomed over coming oil-supply problems: ?By some estimates, there will be an average of two per cent annual growth in global oil demand over the years ahead along with conservatively a 3 percent natural decline in production from existing reserves. That means by 2010 we will need on the order of an additional 50 million barrels a day.?</p>
<p>Those barrels would have to come largely from the Middle East, and a few years earlier the Wall Street Journal had reported an Anglo-American oil company consensus: that Iraq, specifically, was ?the biggie? in terms of potential future reserves. During 2001, the energy task force that became Cheney?s first major assignment as vice president spent much time poring over maps of the oilfields in Iraq and the rival nations?China, Russia, and France among them?to whom Saddam Hussein intended to give the concessions for development. Part of Cheney?s mandate involved ?actions regarding the capture of new and existing oil and gas fields.?</p>
<p>This was getting down to the primal underpinnings of the 2003 invasion. According to Paul Roberts in his 2004 book The End of Oil, Cheney and his task-force colleagues</p>
<p>The Anglo-American firms, in turn, would be in the catbird?s seat.</p>
<p>As for the supposed weapons of mass destruction, these had already played a crucial role. The United Nations sanctions imposed in the early 1990s included provisions that Saddam could not sign over development of the big Iraqi oilfields to foreign companies. On one hand, this gave the French, Russians, and Chinese an incentive to get Iraq out from under the sanctions. But on another, the key allegations that enabled the U.S. and Britain to keep sanctions in place were?what else??Saddam?s alleged weapons of mass destruction. Without WMD, the sanctions would have fallen away, and the rivals of the U.S. and Britain would have gotten the ?biggie? oilfields.</p>
<p>In short, the weapons of mass destruction drumbeat was substantially tied to oil and had already done its essential job by the time the invasion took place. Accept this logic and it makes mincemeat out of the Bush-Rumsfeld-Blair pretense.</p>
<p>The cynic will say, yes, but why could Bush and Rumsfeld not talk a little bit about oil just as the first Bush had prior to the Gulf War? Strategically, there were major differences. In 2003, there was no Kuwait to liberate as a justification for tangling with Saddam. This time it was a flat-out invasion to topple Saddam and take control. Admitting that oil was a principal motivation would have lost the public-relations battle not just in the Middle East but around most of the world. The administration had to have some larger, more noble rationale, and the war on terror offered a broad umbrella. At every opportunity, officials of the Bush administration, not least the president himself, tried to tie Saddam Hussein to terrorism and, indirectly, even to 9/11.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the White House had to consider the huge religious and biblical element of the coalition that elected Bush in 2000. Newsweek polling back in 1999 found that 45 percent of American Christians believed in Armageddon and the end times, and almost as many thought that the Antichrist was already alive and on the earth. Because such beliefs concentrate among very pro-Bush evangelicals, fundamentalists, and Pentecostals, my estimate is that some 55 percent of the people who voted for Bush in 2000 would have told pollsters about believing in the end times and Armageddon.</p>
<p>This will strike many as an exaggeration, but the phenomenon is an important one. Richard Cizik of the National Association of Evangelicals noted in 2003 that since the break-up of the USSR, ?evangelicals have substituted Islam for the Soviet Union. The Muslims have become the modern-day equivalent of the Evil Empire.? According to University of Wisconsin historian Paul Boyer, by the 1990s many prophecy believers saw Saddam as the Antichrist or his forerunner, partly because Saddam was rebuilding the ancient evil city of Babylon. The Left Behind series by Tim LaHaye fictionalized the Rapture-Tribulation-Armageddon sequence so successfully that it sold a whopping 60 million copies in book and tape form. Most of the readers were Bush backers.</p>
<p>Politically, this confronted the White House with both a strategic dilemma and a parallel opportunity. On the plus side, the huge chunk of Bush voters would want to view the U.S. attempt to topple Saddam Hussein in terms of the war of good versus evil. Weapons of mass destruction were a prop but collateral to the larger biblical context. Invading Iraq would evoke that context because Saddam was one of the evil ones?maybe the Evil One, given his Babylon tie-in. Toppling him could aspire to biblical interpretation. Aiding Israel was also biblically vital. Bush had already carved out a related, overarching ?good versus evil? posture with his heavily religious post-9/11 rhetoric.</p>
<p>The minuses were fewer but cautionary. It was fine for the White House to criticize the United Nations because the international body was a favorite whipping post among the high-octane preachers given to quoting the Book of Revelation. Oil, however, wasn?t part of the biblical prophecy framework. In LaHaye?s series, petroleum was a minor strategic gambit of the Antichrist, not the business of the good guys. Oil?s increasing centrality was a bad sign on the websites of omen-counters like raptureready.com.</p>
<p>Maybe this had something to do with the Bush-Rumsfeld-Blair posture of oil not being at all involved and maybe it didn?t. However, the rhetorical fact remains: oil-related motives and objectives were insistently forsworn, even if they were prominent?especially in Dick Cheney?s petroleum-savvy mind. Many Americans think his task force has been kept wrapped in secrecy because large oil companies were closely involved, but keeping oil-related war motivations hidden may have been even more vital.</p>
<p>If the Americans and British did act substantially for oil?and that seems highly likely?then it is fair to judge the Iraqi failure by oil-policy yardsticks and outcomes. The quick summation, obviously, is that whereas oil was selling at roughly $30 a barrel in 2002 as the White House was plotting its invasion and occupation, by late 2004 it cost a more painful $40 per barrel. By the time the operation was marking its third anniversary this spring, petroleum was flirting with $75 a barrel.</p>
<p>There is no room in this article to document that prior to the U.S. invasion in 2003, everything about Iraq (and neighboring Kuwait) generally boiled down to oil. Suffice it to say that Iraq?s new boundaries were drawn around oil after World War I; Axis forces invaded from Syria in 1941 in pursuit of petroleum; important Persian Gulf surveys generally concentrated on oilfields; the maps Cheney looked at in 2001 were about oil; and on entering Baghdad in 2003, the first government building U.S. troops occupied was the Oil Ministry, with its seismic maps of the rich Iraqi oilfields.</p>
<p>Anglo-American politics had also become increasingly shaped by oil. The Bush administration marked the first time that both the president and the vice president hailed from the oil industry. British Prime Minister Tony Blair, in turn, was so close to British Petroleum that wags called BP ?Blair Petroleum.?</p>
<p>Besides, if oil had nothing to do with the invasion, why did top officials of the Bush administration mention it in predicting how well the invasion would work out? Cheney opined that by the end of 2003, Iraqi oil output would hit 3 million barrels a day, and Lawrence Lindsey, the White House economic adviser, talked about 3-5 million, saying in September 2002, ?the key issue is oil, and a regime change in Iraq would facilitate an increase in world oil? so as to drive down prices. Paul Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld?s deputy in the Pentagon, enthused that increased Iraqi oil revenues could pay for the war. And White House speechwriter David Frum wrote in his 2003 book on Bush that the war on terror was designed to ?bring new stability to the most vicious and violent quadrant of the earth?and new prosperity to us all, by securing the world?s largest pool of oil.?</p>
<p>The best way to assess the oil-related outcomes?all bungles, no boons?is to use three different yardsticks: postwar oil supplies and prices; recrimination against the U.S. dollar; and the rising portion of U.S. defense outlays that had to be spent on protecting land and deep-water oilfields, pipelines, and sea lanes vital to oil tankers.</p>
<p>The administration?s hope that a quick and overwhelming victory in Iraq would unleash enough new oil production to flood the markets and undercut OPEC, however absurd in retrospect, tantalized traders during the invasion weeks. On March 21, 2003, the Financial Times noted, ?futures prices suggest that when it is over, OPEC will shower the world with crude and the price will fall out of its $22-28 band late next year.?</p>
<p>Instead, occupied Iraq turned into a quicksand of guerrilla and sectarian rivalry. Insurgents attacked and disrupted pipelines and refineries, and truck drivers refused to transport oil from the north. During the winter of 2005-2006, Iraqi production dropped as low as 1.1 million barrels a day, and covering this production gap took almost all of OPEC?s spare capacity and forced prices higher. Dalton Garis, an economist at the Petroleum Institute in Abu Dhabi, told the Associated Press in April 2006, ?Iraq could be making a tremendous difference.? Instead, its shortfall is ?a significant contributing factor to the high price of oil.?</p>
<p>American economists Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes, in a draft paper entitled ?The Economic Costs of the Iraq War: An Appraisal Three Years After the Beginning of the Conflict,? reached a similar but much more detailed and buttressed conclusion. Publicly, Stiglitz and Bilmes attribute $5-10 of the increased per barrel cost of oil to the mess in Iraq, but their private view seems to be that a very large portion of the now $45-per-barrel oil-price increase is attributable to Iraq.</p>
<p>That makes sense if one considers the hostile reactions of many of the world?s oil-producing nations to the behavior the Bush administration was exhibiting in Iraq and elsewhere. For several years prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, that nation had been insisting?contrary to global policies in effect since the 1970s?that it would price its oil sales in euros, not dollars. Other major OPEC producers?Venezuela and Iran?also began talking about kindred moves and so did elements of the European community. Just after the U.S. invasion, Newsweek?s Howard Fineman wrote that the real clash was not over weapons of mass destruction but over the dollar versus the euro??who gets to sell?and buy?Iraqi oil, and what form of currency will be used to denominate the value of the sales ? yet another skirmish in a growing economic conflict.? Few others had the courage to raise the issue.</p>
<p>Had a U.S. triumph in Iraq enabled Washington to control and open the oil spigots in Iraq, OPEC would have been obliged to desist from talking about dropping the dollar to price oil in euros or a so-called basket of currencies. But as the various dimensions of U.S. failure became clear in 2003 and 2004, other nations?Indonesia, Malaysia, and Russia (not an OPEC member)?began to show their currency claws. Six months after the U.S. invasion, as Iraqi oil output shrank in the face of relentless sabotage of pipelines and other facilities by insurgents, even Saudi Arabia displayed its disdain, not by currency actions but by giving a big gas-development contract to French Total instead of ExxonMobil.</p>
<p>As of 2006, the U.S. dollar has been dropping again, with the ever more conspicuous failure of Bush administration energy policy?this year the U.S. will spend $300-350 billion on imported oil?a significant backdrop. Should these trends intensify and OPEC cease to price oil in dollars, the added burden on Americans will register in everything from home heating oil in northern winters to the prohibitive cost of long-distance driving in the remote exurbs of metropolitan commuter belts. The effects of the great bungle in Iraq may only be beginning.</p>
<p>Still another oil cost-burden that the Iraqi failure imposes on the American people involves the huge and finally starting to be noticed portion of U.S. defense outlays that are undertaken to protect foreign oil supplies from disruption. Michael Klare, a leading U.S. scholar on resource wars and oil geopolitics, has tabulated oil-related tasks being assumed by the military from South America and West Africa to the Persian Gulf, Central Asia, and the Straits of Malacca. His conclusion: the military ?is being used more and more for the protection of overseas oil fields and the supply routes that connect them. ? Such endeavors, once largely confined to the Gulf area, are now being extended to unstable oil regions in other parts of the world. Slowly but surely, the U.S. military is being converted into a global oil-protection service.? How much do these tax-financed costs effectively add to the price of a gallon of gas or heating oil sold in the U.S.?25 cents, 40, 85?</p>
<p>In sum, the energy-related price of the administration?s dishonesty and massive miscalculation in Iraq ought to be a central discussion point in this election year and again in 2008. The citizenry has to comprehend just how much is at stake and how the nation?s future has been jeopardized.</p>

<article id="0000771" published-at="2015-04-21" title="How a Pulitzer-winning series forced South Carolina to face its domestic violence problem"><p>From the time its first installment was published, <a href="http://www.postandcourier.com/tilldeath/title.html" type="external">?Til Death Do Us Part,?</a> a powerful series about domestic abuse in South Carolina from the Charleston Post and Courier, seemed destined for Pulitzer Prize contention.</p>
<p>And on Monday, the seven-part series <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/citation/2015-Public-Service" type="external">was honored</a> with the nation?s most prestigious journalism prize, the Pulitzer for public service. Judges called the work ?a riveting series that probed why South Carolina is among the deadliest states in the union for women and put the issue of what to do about it on the state?s agenda.?</p>
<p>Produced by reporters Doug Pardue, Glenn Smith, Jennifer Berry Hawes, and Natalie Caula Hauff, with funding, editing help, and database training from the Center for Investigative Reporting, ?Till Death? is a clear example of journalism that matters. What remains to be seen is if it can drive authorities in the state to finally act.</p>
<p>I spent most of the past decade as a reporter in South Carolina. When the crime statistics came out each year, local news outlets would report on how the state was among the worst in the nation for domestic violence and women killed by men. It was a sad ritual, one in which I <a href="http://www.free-times.com/archives/south-carolina-2nd-in-nation-for-women-killed-by-men" type="external">did</a> my <a href="http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/advocates-say-culture-courts-partly-to-blame-for-scs-high-ranking-in-domestic-homicides/Content?oid=4779374" type="external">part</a>: usually one story, citing the latest figure, calling the usual suspects for comment, maybe reporting from a news conference held by whoever the attorney general happened to be at the time.</p>
<p>But 2014 was different. The Post and Courier went beyond the daily or weekly news cycle to show the brutal reality behind the numbers cited each year by media. The paper catalogued impunity for abusers, lack of support for the abused, and indifference from officials to explain why those numbers were the way the were?and why they weren?t changing. The largest newspaper in South Carolina absolutely shamed the state?s policymakers into making domestic violence a legislative priority.</p>
<p>Passages like this one, from the <a href="http://www.postandcourier.com/tilldeath/partone.html" type="external">opening story</a> of the series, stood out:</p>
<p>When asked, most state legislators profess deep concern over domestic violence. Yet they maintain a legal system in which a man can earn five years in prison for abusing his dog but a maximum of just 30 days in jail for beating his wife or girlfriend on a first offense.</p>
<p>Or this one, describing the fate of a set of bills to toughen penalties for abusers and protect victims:</p>
<p>The bills languished in committees and died, with the exception of a lone provision that aims to protect the welfare of family pets left in the care of a person facing domestic abuse charges</p>
<p>That had happened earlier in 2014, during a legislative session that had ended like plenty before it?reform proposals introduced, earnest efforts on the part of activists, few results.</p>
<p>By that point, the Post and Courier team was deep into its work, which <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/files/2015/public-service/postcourier/postcourierletter2015.pdf" type="external">had begun in the prior fall</a>, after another report about the state?s dismal record. By June 2014, with Post and Courier reporters making calls around the statehouse, lawmakers took note of the attention. The then-House Speaker <a href="http://www.postandcourier.com/tilldeath/partone.html" type="external">contacted the paper</a> ?to say he was disappointed the session had ended with no action,? and pledged to move the issue forward.</p>
<p>In August, the paper?s series was published. And since then, domestic abuse has been on the state agenda in a big, sustained way. An ad hoc committee promised by the House Speaker met. When the attorney general held a ? <a href="http://www.scag.gov/archives/18868" type="external">call to action</a>,? he was flanked by top lawmakers and sheriffs and police chiefs from around the state. The governor, too, got on board and <a href="http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20150129/PC1603/150129346/gov-nikki-haley-heading-task-force-confronting-culture-of-domestic-violence" type="external">created a task force</a> to combat the culture of domestic violence. The facts and stats and figures hadn?t changed. But the journalism changed, and it made the difference.</p>
<p>And so, have any laws actually changed?</p>
<p>?Not yet,? says Laura Hudson, who runs the South Carolina Crime Victims? Council.</p>
<p>?Nothing has changed at all,? she told me Monday?at least, not yet.</p>
<p>That?s because while the issue is high on the agenda, the state House and Senate have two different bills and are still hashing them out. One sticking point has been over whether someone convicted of domestic violence should be able to own guns. Hudson says she expects to know within two weeks if the two chambers can get together and make something actually happen. If not, she says, well, maybe next year.</p>
<p>As for The Post and Courier, Hudson said she couldn?t give the paper enough credit, and she doubted anything significant would have come out of the legislature without the series. She noted that the paper didn?t just run the initial investigation, but has <a href="http://www.postandcourier.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?Category=search&amp;amp;kwords=till&amp;amp;trendname=TillDeath&amp;amp;sortbydate=1" type="external">followed through</a>, tracking legislation and reporting relevant updates. Consider an <a href="http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20150412/PC1603/150419886" type="external">April 12 story</a> by the paper?s statehouse reporter, who wasn?t on the original series, about one of the legislative sticking points. Its headline: ?Lawmakers wary of domestic violence gun ban because of political risks.?</p>
<p>The Post &amp;amp; Courier deserves the Pulitzer it won this week. As for the state that provided the fodder for it?as they say down there, bless its heart.</p>

<article id="0000788" published-at="2008-12-07" title="Thai opposition planning to form new government"><p>Caption</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>Thailand's main opposition party said Saturday that it plans to form a new government with the help of defectors from the ruling coalition, a move certain to appease an anti-government group that recently paralyzed the capital, shutting down its main international airport for a week.</p>
<p>The opposition <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Democrat+Party%22" type="external">Democrat Party</a> announced it had mustered the backing of 260 lawmakers in the 400-seat lower house, allowing it to form a government with Oxford-educated party leader <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Abhisit+Vejjajiva%22" type="external">Abhisit Vejjajiva</a> as the new prime minister.</p>
<p>But the party's apparent triumph, managed during a still-chaotic situation the day after Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport reopened, will not be sealed until Parliament meets within the next 30 days to endorse Abhisit and the five-party coalition behind him.

<p>The FBI is warning law enforcement agencies across the country of pending violence following the Ferguson grand jury decision. Electrical and water treatment facilities could be targeted. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-warns-ferguson-decision-lead-violence-extremist-protesters/story?id=26980624" type="external">ABC News</a> reported:</p>
<p>As the nation waits to hear whether a Missouri police officer will face charges for killing unarmed teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., the FBI is warning law enforcement agencies across the country that the decision ?will likely? lead some extremist protesters to threaten and even attack police officers or federal agents.</p>
<p>Peaceful protesters could be caught in the middle, and electrical facilities or water treatment plants could also become targets. In addition, so-called ?hacktivists? like the group ?Anonymous? could try to launch cyber-attacks against authorities.</p>
<p>?The announcement of the grand jury?s decision ? will likely be exploited by some individuals to justify threats and attacks against law enforcement and critical infrastructure,? the FBI says in an intelligence bulletin issued in recent days. ?This also poses a threat to those civilians engaged in lawful or otherwise constitutionally protected activities.?</p>
<p>The FBI bulletin expresses concern only over those who would exploit peaceful protests, not the masses of demonstrators who will want to legitimately, lawfully and collectively express their views on the grand jury?s decision.</p>
<p>The bulletin ?stresses the importance of remaining aware of the protections afforded to all U.S. persons exercising their First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.?</p>

<article id="0000798" published-at="2013-08-26" title="John Bolton: US Could End Up Worse Off If Obama Acts Against Syria">If the United States takes military action against Syria, it could end up worse off than if it did nothing, says former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton. Washington is abuzz with talk of possible cruise missile attacks after the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad crossed a "red line" set by President Barack Obama a year ago. Last week was the second time U.S. intelligence has confirmed Syria has used chemical weapons on civilians in the country's civil war. And there was video purporting to show children injured and dying in the latest attack. Obama's "red line" quote occurred a few months before the 2012 election and was "one of those rhetorical flourishes that the president likes," Bolton said Monday on Fox News Channel's "On the Record with Greta Van Susteren." "He never thinks through the implications." Military action, at this point, is "almost unavoidable," Bolton said. In addition to Obama's "red line" being crossed, Secretary of State John Kerry took to the podium Monday to blast the latest actions as a "moral obscenity," which fueled speculation that military action is inevitable. Any action taken by the administration should be the result of a calculation of what is in America's national interest, Bolton said. The United States should destroy Syria's chemical weapons and kill Assad, who ordered the attacks, he said. But Obama must act quickly, he added. "Every day that he waits, every day that he dithers, every day that he looks for some amorphous international approval, gives the Assad regime the chance to move those chemical weapons and hide them," he said. But even if Obama uses a large military force, the United States could still end up worse off than if he'd done nothing at all, Bolton told Van Susteren. Obama "has a real credibility problem in his own mind if he doesn't do something," Bolton said. "That doesn't mean he has the slightest idea what the strategic effect of the use of military force is going to be." It would take a "character transplant" for Obama to move effectively, he said. "To paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld, you go to war with the president you have," Bolton said. "And I don't think this president understands enough about the implications of what he's about to do, or even that he can define what his objective is, that it doesn't put us more at risk of using military force and actually undermining our long-term interest."</article>
<article id="0000805" published-at="2014-12-16" title="Die-in demonstration: Style over substance, divided by race"><p>ANALYSIS:&amp;#160;University of Michigan ?die-in? may have been Instagram gold, but that?s all it was</p>
<p>ANN ARBOR, Mich. ?&amp;#160;Last Wednesday?s&amp;#160;?die-in? protest at the University of Michigan was received with mixed reviews, with questions asked about the nature of the protest and the message it tried to convey.</p>
<p>Was it worth it to <a href="" type="internal">make race the focus</a> ? as opposed to a more inclusive demonstration against police brutality toward all people? Was it necessary to call out potential white protesters as ? <a href="" type="internal">members of the oppressing party</a>? the day before the protest, while specifically handing the reins of the protest over to groups such as the Black Student Union and the local NAACP chapter? Was it a mistake to focus on #BlackLivesMatter instead of #AllLivesMatter?</p>
<p>It definitely turned off Kayla Garthus, a junior who was ?extremely supportive? of the protest as it was originally advertised.</p>
<p>?I know many of my colleagues, my peers, were willing to come to this event initially based on their belief that white people, just like all people of color, could stand together in solidarity under the term ?humanity? over an extremely volatile issue,? she said.&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal"></a></p>
<p>That sentiment changed following racially charged Facebook posts <a href="" type="internal">announcing</a> the event?s three white student organizers had handed the event over to black student groups, with the top comment being a link describing how white protestors should act in order to be ?good white allies.?</p>
<p>?My fear was coming and being labeled a ?racist? and an ?oppressor? simply by my race, my color,? Garthus told The College Fix. ?So I felt uncomfortable participating in this event.?</p>
<p>No more than a couple hundred people actually participated in the ?die-in,? a far cry from the 1,700 who originally said they were going to attend on Facebook.</p>
<p>Facebook events are known to overestimate the amount of actual attendees, and it?s hard to say if the protest?s racial tilt had any effect on turnout. But Garthus was not the only potential protestor dissatisfied with the focus on race instead of police brutality.</p>
<p>?Why does the leader have to be African American?? asked one protestor on Facebook. ?By continuing to separate and segregate, we create an us vs. them attitude in the minds of both groups.?</p>
<p>Jamie Thomson, a student from Detroit-Mercy who was also rubbed the wrong way by the explanation of the original organizers for stepping down, offered an interesting perspective.</p>
<p>?As a black student on campus, I want to know what the majority of my peers feel about these issues because as a black American, I already know how this affects my life,? she explained on Facebook. ?Everyday I hear and see black people speak about it and react to it, but it would truly make all the difference for me to hear from others on these issues.?</p>
<p>And in the aftermath of the demonstration, a student expressed her frustration by posting on the event?s wall: ?I was incredibly disappointed?we should have taken to the streets?I will next time steer clear of student protests that are more about the pictures than the protest?we couldn?t even hear the speakers?we need to do better??</p>
<p>Which brings us to the protest itself. ?More about the pictures than the protest? rings incredibly true. It was a spectacle for sure, and it effectively blocked off an area that normally experiences the heaviest amount of foot traffic on campus.</p>
<p>?The goal to have it in the diag was to infringe people?s line of walking, sort of like a symbol of more of like a greater idea that a lot of people just in their daily lives, for example, in these urban communities, they can?t walk peacefully each day, or at least that?s somewhat, I think, how they feel,? freshman Kevin Wolf, who said he helped out with the event, told The College Fix.</p>
<p>While it did provide a field-day for amateur photographers, who could be seen walking through the grave of ?dead? protestors to get close up shots, it also placed a clear emphasis on the artistic over the political.</p>
<p>The only thing it really accomplished was to ?raise awareness.? What it did not do was identify specific causes of injustices, nor provide potential solutions.</p>
<p>Should we look toward demilitarizing the police, for example?</p>
<p>?No,? Wolf told The Fix. ?I think that there is a reasoning for (police militarization), and it makes sense. I think a demilitarized police just sounds like?it?s like going back to the 20?s when police were outweighed by bad people.?</p>
<p>Well then, maybe make body cameras mandatory for officers?</p>
<p>?I have a limited amount of knowledge of what organizations such as CopWatch have to say. I would probably refer to them for any real solutions,? freshman die-in protestor named James said in an interview.</p>
<p>Indeed the only remedies suggested were of the vague and ambiguous variety.</p>
<p>?The system needs to be either rewritten, some laws need to be re-passed, but there is no quick-fix,? said William Royster, a member of the Black Student Union.</p>
<p>Therein lies the problem.</p>
<p>Every protestor seemed to agree that ?society is somewhat broken and needs fixing,? as stated by Wolf, but nobody seems too concerned about finding a fix. And while the ?die-in? may have been Instagram gold, those digging for answers struck nothing at this event.</p>
<p>Instead, we found ?dead? protestors arising from the afterlife every few seconds to text. We found a protestor holding a sign that read #JusticeForJohnCrawford,? and then when pressed on the incident he was referring to, admitted ?it may not be the best example of police brutality.?</p>
<p>Many, if not most, of the protestors seemed content to protest for the sake of protesting. None of this is to minimize the issue at hand; police brutality is unquestionably an issue of the upmost importance. When citizens of a country are roundly afraid of the very people who are supposed to ?protect and serve? them, there is a problem, one that should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>But this protest failed to hit the mark.</p>
<p>Was it because the protest lacked a clear, impactful purpose? Was it because of the insistence on making it a racial issue?</p>
<p>?I definitely felt as though it detracted from potentially a larger meaning in this,? Garthus said.</p>
<p>Tellingly, she provided the most pointed response of anyone when prompted for solutions to this issue.</p>
<p>?Giving police military-grade weaponry is completely negligible to human rights, not to mention the war on drugs that has perpetuated through the nation, especially in inner city areas, also does not help police brutality issues, especially with people of color,? she said.</p>
<p>This is what the protest missed when it focused on #BlackLivesMatter instead of #AllLivesMatter.</p>
<p>This is what is left out when the focus is on ?white privilege? instead of ?blue privilege,? as nationally syndicated black radio host Charlamagne Tha God claimed last week.</p>
<p>When potential white protestors are ostracized as ?members of the oppressing party,? the protest loses the potential for students of all races to spread ideas that could actually make an impact.</p>
<p>As it happens, another protest titled ?I CAN?T BREATHE? has been planned for MLK Day, Jan. 19. The event description reads:</p>
<p>?The issue of police brutality is not a black issue?it is everyone?s issue?it is the police state that we have allowed to sneak up and drain us of our constitutional rights.?</p>
<p>It?s a message hopefully everyone can get behind.</p>

<p><a href="/economics/trade" type="external">Trade</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/29/opinion/29kristof.html?hp" type="external">Nick Kristof</a>accuses the US -- Democrats in Congress in particular -- of scapegoating China, and blaming China for global economic problems (more accurately, the risk of global economic problems) that fundamentally are made in America.</p>
<p>Alas, the U.S. is mostly to blame for this. And the biggest culprit of all is the demagoguery of some Democrats in Congress. There are plenty of legitimate reasons to be angry with China?s leaders, but its trade success and exchange rate policy are not among them. The country that is distorting global capital flows and destabilizing the world economy is not China but the U.S. American fiscal recklessness is a genuine international problem, while blaming Chinese for making shoes efficiently amounts to a protectionist assault on the global trade system.</p>
<p>(Emphasis added)</p>
<p>The structural US fiscal deficit certainly contributes to the imbalances that hang over the world economy. The fiscal deficit is falling a tad right now on the back of a real-estate induced boom in tax revenues (corporate tax revenue is also way up), but the same real estate boom also is making the US external deficit bigger. The kind of fiscal adjustment that will reduce the US external imbalance requires slowing US demand growth -- not just riding the wave of revenue that comes with a real estate boom.</p>
<p>I don?t necessarily like the way the American policy makers, Republicans and Democrats alike, have gone about trying to change China?s peg. The Bush Administration certainly has been more willing to blame China for the US trade deficit <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/dd5f3e1c-c7ca-11d9-9765-00000e2511c8,_i_rssPage=6e6e833c-cbff-11d7-81c6-0820abe49a01.html" type="external">than to look in the mirror</a>.</p>
<p>But China also bears some responsibility for current global imbalances. For every bad borrower, there is a bad lender.</p>
<p>Specifically, I think China?s leadership can be criticized for:</p>
<p>1. China?s consumption deficit. Chinese household consumption has not been growing as fast as Chinese income. Less domestic demand means that more of China?s productive capacity is devoted toward exports. The absence of stronger consumption growth in China (and the associated rise in Chinese savings and growing Chinese savings surplus) is a global problem -- and one that is not made in America. China?s consumption deficit (and the resulting savings surplus) is one reason why China?s 2005 current account surplus is likely to be around 8% of its GDP. China?s consumption deficit also is a potential problem for China: China is becoming dangerously dependent on continued growth in global demand to make up for a shortage of domestic demand.</p>
<p>2. Continuing to peg to the dollar after 2002, when the dollar started to decline v. range of other currencies. Up until 2002, a rising dollar meant a rising Chinese currency, which made sense given China?s rising productivity. After 2002, the dollar -- generally speaking -- has fallen. The result of a weaker dollar: a boom in Chinese exports to the world. After the dollar started to fall, China?s export growth rate accelerated to 30% annually. Goldman Sachs estimates the RMB has depreciated in real terms by about 15% since March 2002. And since the RMB -- unlike most other currencies -- has not appreciated against the dollar since 2002, China remains a very attractive location for production aimed at the US market. In 2003 and 2004, booming commodity imports (and rising commodity prices) kept China?s trade surplus for soaring. But now that the commodity boom has tapered off a bit and China has slowed credit growth to (perhaps) more sustainable levels, China has started to run a huge trade surplus. Jonathan Anderson of UBS estimates China?s trade surplus could reach $120b in 2005. It just doesn?t make sense for a country with a large trade surplus to peg to the currency of a country with a large trade deficit.</p>
<p>3. Imposing potentially large costs on China?s future taxpayers to subsidize current Chinese export growth. The US and the EU have long subsidized certain of their exports. Subsidized financing for purchasing commerical aircraft come to mind. If two rich countries compete by subsidizing a product that poor countries don?t produce, poor countries benefit, at least so long as they don?t run up too much debt (it is a bit more complicated if the poor country also produces the subsidized good). But a system where the taxpayers of poor countries subsidize consumers in rich countries is a bit perverse. Yet by rapidly building up its reserves, that is exactly what China is doing. Through its central bank, China?s government is lending to the US -- call it "vendor financing" -- on terms that virtually guarantee that China will lose money.</p>
<p>Coastal China?s export success does not stem entirely from the efficiency of its factories and the (unquestioned) drive of its people: China?s willingness to spend huge, right now truly huge, sums to keep its exchange rate from rising has something to do with it as well.</p>
<p>My core beef with Kirstof: US fiscal deficits are not entirely independent of China?s willingness to finance them. China, after all, has a certain amount of influence over US economic policy. It China?s leadership really wanted the US to reduce its fiscal deficit, I suspect it could bring about a change in the Treasury market that would make the ongoing US deficit a bit harder for politicians and market participants alike to ignore.</p>
<p>It is darn hard to generate political momentum to close the budget deficit when the emergence of $350-400 b (3.0-3.5% of GDP) fiscal deficits in GOOD times has not prevented (to say the least) a boom in the most interest sensitive sector of the economy. Higher mortgage rates are usually one way most Americans feel the "cost" of running large, sustained budget deficits. Thanks in no small part to financing from China?s central bank -- and the central banks of a bunch of other countries, whether oil exporters or Asian consumer goods exporters -- those fiscal deficits have coincided with low long-term rates. (See among others, <a href="http://www.financeasia.com/articles/2B304A6F-9027-7E17-4B3371C8DDCF39AA.cfm" type="external">Richard Duncan</a>)</p>
<p>If China chooses to subsidize the US Treasury market (along with the Agency market, and probably the mortgage backed security market), doesn?t it also bear some responsibility for the resulting US recklessness? China?s 2005 reserve accumulation may not be that much smaller than the US 2005 fiscal deficit. That may explain why US policy makers talk more about a global savings glut than the hard choices required to close the fiscal deficit.</p>
<p>End note: Data on foreign demand for US Treasuries is found <a href="http://www.treas.gov/tic/mfh.txt" type="external">here</a> -- but be warned, the data almost certainly understate China?s role in US markets. Reported Chinese purchases of US securities of all kinds lag well behind China?s reserve accumulation. And for an amazing graph showing the close linkage between rising foreign holdings of Treasuries and the increase in the stock of Treasury debt outstanding, see p. 12 of <a href="http://www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/debt-management/adv-com/minutes/dc-2005-q2.pdf" type="external">this presentation</a>. A final aside: I don?t agree with <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/3184e084-d070-11d9-abb8-00000e2511c8.html" type="external">Amity Shlaes? argument</a>that the current peg creates constructive ties between the US and China. I don?t the surplus and deficit countries should have the same monetary policy or the same exchange rate. I also think she exaggerates the risks of a (small) 10% move in the renminbi. After all, the renminbi has moved by about 7% against the euro already this year. But she is right to note that the US policy of trying to manage its complicated relationship with China by keeping each bilateral issue in its own separate "lane" is bound to create some confusion.</p>

<p>One thing is clear: the convergence trade just got a bit riskier ...</p>
<p>I will be watching to see how the Turkish markets react to the non -- a non cannot be good for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/29/international/europe/29cnd-france.html?hp&amp;amp;ex=1117425600&amp;amp;en=013cb5d9cd57930d&amp;amp;ei=5094&amp;amp;partner=homepage" type="external">Chirac</a>, or for Turkey?s chances of gaining membership in the EU.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the Euro is now back around where it was at the end of 2003 -- in the 1.25-1.26 range. All the valuation gains that the US enjoyed on its European assets in 2004 have now disappeared. Remember, when the dollar falls against the euro, it immediately improves the US net international investment position by increasing the value of the United States substantial European assets. To repeat the valuation gains of 2004, the US needs the dollar to fall to 1.455 by the end of 2005. That does not seem likely. If nothing changes, the US is looking at a huge increase in its net external debt in 2005. A large current account deficit, and substantial valuation losses.</p>
<p>The OECD puts the US current account deficit at 6.4% of GDP in 05 (a bit under $800b), and 6.7% of GDP in 06 (close to $900b). If the euro stays around 1.25, European growth continues to lag, and Chinese exports continue to surge, that strikes me as a bit too low -- the q4 2004 US current account deficit was around 6.3% of GDP. The <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/14/9/34911415.pdf" type="external">OECD presentation</a> contains plenty of other interesting information. Note strong domestic demand growth in France, for example, fueled by rising real estate values -- which in a way makes current French unhappiness more striking. But real wage growth has slowed in France recently, and real wages are falling in Germany -- there is a reason why European voters are unhappy. Adjustment through deflation is never fun.</p>

<p>Low interest rates are the common denominator linking together Greenspan?s frothy local housing markets, but local conditions can dominate low national, if not global, interest rates. If there are <a href="http://www.propertyrightsresearch.org/articles6/amid_dying_towns_of_rural_plains.htm" type="external">more houses than people</a>, it is hard for housing prices to increase much -- even if interest rates are low. Without new investors chasing the windfall gains from the initial surge in prices, there is not as much speculative froth. In those parts of the US where the population is shrinking and <a href="http://www.fmpc.uconn.edu/milk/Times12802.pdf" type="external">incomes are generally low</a> (Note: Timothy Egan?s reporting on the plight of great plains small towns has been excellent), there does not seem to be much of a housing bubble.</p>
<p>To paraphrase <a href="http://www.northerntrust.com/library/econ_research/weekly/us/pc052605.pdf" type="external">Paul Kasriel?s summary of Greenspan</a>, there is no housing bubble in Manhattan KS (where I grew up), but there is one in Manhattan New York (where I now live). That characterization is a bit off. Manhattan KS (a growing university town and regional medical center) is far more frothy than say Stafford or St. John?s KS, but it has a grain of truth.</p>
<p>Even within "bubble" America, there are differences. Interest-only markets like California seems to have a bit more froth than someplace like <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/27/AR2005052701345.html" type="external">almost interest-only</a>Washington DC. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/28/business/28home.html" type="external">rent to price ratio</a>is a bit higher in California than in DC, where rental prices have trended up. All that homeland security and global-war-on-terror related work ... The real estate bubble has generated <a href="http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000039&amp;amp;refer=columnist_currier&amp;amp;sid=arfsdmWaO1PE" type="external">big money</a>-- at least on paper. Dollar <a href="http://www.northerntrust.com/library/econ_research/daily/us/dd052405.pdf" type="external">turnover</a> in the housing market was equal to 10% of US GDP in q1. Housing accounts for 40% of all post-.com bubble job creation. The <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2005/03/be_wary_of_anyt.html" type="external">US real estate to GDP ratio</a>is now approaching the US equities to GDP ratio back in 2000.</p>
<p>Update. <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2005/05/nytimes-hear-pop-watch-out.html" type="external">Calculated Risk</a>has drawn attention to this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/29/business/yourmoney/29view.html" type="external">NY Times article</a>, which notes that real estate may account for 25% of the US economy ...</p>
<p>Since real estate is relatively widely owned, as far as financial assets go, the capital gains are probably not as concentrated as the (paper) gains from the .com bubble. But the surge in housing prices still has enormous distributional consequences. The net worth of those who already own homes -- generally an older group -- has gone up, along with the net worth of those lucky (or smart) enough to get in early. Those who don?t already own homes are worse off; the cost of buying a home has gone way up.</p>
<p>And there is a regional component -- the coasts have generally had more real estate froth than the interior. Alan Greenspan?s everyday low interest rates have been kinder to blue states than red states.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000039&amp;amp;sid=a8Gu53fSyGLw&amp;amp;refer=columnist_berry" type="external">John Berry</a>rightly has highlighted the distributional consequences of the mortgage interest tax credit and other housing tax subsidies:</p>
<p>Altogether, the benefits from those tax breaks are wildly skewed according to income levels and where taxpayers live. In general, higher-income households that can easily afford to own a house without such subsidies get the bulk of the benefits.</p>
<p>Last year the National Bureau of Economic Research published a paper by two Wharton School economists, Todd Sinai and Joseph Gyourko, who used data for the U.S. 2000 Census and other sources to compute the subsidy per owner-occupied unit in each state in 1999.</p>
<p>That subsidy ranged from a low of $2,240 in North Dakota to $12,759 in Hawaii. Among metropolitan areas the disparity was much greater: $26,385 in San Francisco-San Mateo-Redwood City, California, and a scant $1,541 in McAllen-Edinburg-Pharr along Texas?s Mexican border. Some East Coast areas also had huge subsidies and many in states such as Tennessee, Ohio and Louisiana got little benefit.</p>
<p>Given what has happened to home prices on the two coasts since 1999, the unevenness of the value of the combined tax breaks has soared.</p>
<p>(Sinai-Gyourko paper <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w10322" type="external">here</a>)</p>
<p>Of course, eliminating this tax deduction is about as politically viable as eliminating agricultural subsidies.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are some similarities between housing subsidies and agricultural subsidies, even if agricultural subsidies transfer income from urban to rural areas and housing subsidies transfer help urban at the expense of rural areas. So long as agricultural subsidies are linked to the amount produced, they transfer more to large landowners than small landowners. Set the price high of say wheat high enough to keep smaller farmers in business and bigger farmers will do very well, at least in the absence of some kind of cap. Tax subsidies for interest payments on housing are worth more if you have a big house with big interest payments and pay a high marginal rate than if you have a small house, small payments and are taxed a low rate.</p>
<p>Since salaries and housing prices both tend to be higher on the coasts, the net result is clear: this is a government policy that favors the haves on the coast over the haves in the interior, and haves over have-nots everywhere. There is no "rent" tax deduction last I checked.</p>
<p>My Midwestern chauvinist side always thought it was amusing that the big, sort-of-national daily papers waxed far more eloquent about eliminating farm subsidies than eliminating suburban housing subsidies. Everyone has constituents.</p>
<p>One last aside: US farm subsidies certainly <a href="http://www.law.stanford.edu/programs/academic/enrlp/workshop/BigFarms.pdf" type="external">do need to be reformed</a>, particularly those that have a large impact on poor farmers in the world?s poorest countries. But I also wonder if low-interest rates have not made it more difficult, politically, to get rid of agricultural subsidies, not just housing subsidies. Low interest rates increase the present value of future farm subsidies. To the extent that the market assumes current agricultural subsidies will stick around, they should increase the value of "subsidy-generating" assets -- like land. Alas, I don?t know enough to even try to test this hypothesis.</p>

<p><a href="/economics/trade" type="external">Trade</a></p>
<p>The interest rate on the 10 year Treasury note is somewhere between 4.0-4.1% -- and the US seems to be having no trouble financing its current account (or its budget) deficit right now. The risk of hard landing remains just that, a risk -- right now the market hardly seems worried about the United States? still growing external deficit.</p>
<p>Consequently, this is a reasonable time to step back and look back at some of the arguments that Nouriel and I laid out in February, when we put forward the case that <a href="http://www.stern.nyu.edu/globalmacro/BW2-Unraveling-Roubini-Setser.pdf" type="external">growing external imbalances posed a growing risk to the US economy</a>. We did not suggest that the hard landing was imminent -- we thought the risks were far higher in 2006 than in 2005. In 2006, the US external deficit would be bigger, one-off factors like the corporate tax holiday would have played themselves out, and Asian central banks would hold even more reserves than they do now -- calling into question their willingness to keep on adding to their holdings of dollars. But we did argue that the risks were more immediate than most thought.</p>
<p>Some of the arguments that we made in February look pretty good three and a half months later. Korea?s central bank governor has not mastered the art of communicating with the markets. But it is still pretty clear that Korea thinks it has all the reserves it needs and would rather not continue to add to its reserves. Japan is out of the market, but its past intervention seems to have left a legacy in the market -- the willingness of private Japanese investors to buy US debt hinges in part on expectations that the Japanese authorities will keep the yen from appreciating too much, and thus prevent dollar depreciation from wiping out the positive "carry" generated by higher US interest rates. Change those expectations, and US rates might change to compensate Japanese investors for the greater exchange rate risk. Above all, the burden that China has to bear to support the system seems to be rising. We don?t know the pace of China?s reserve accumulation in April or May, but I would not be surprised if both numbers turn out to be very high -- reserve accumulation of $30b, or even $40 b, in May is not out of the question. Annualized, that works out to $360 b (20% of GDP) or $480 b (25% of GDP) -- a phenomenal sum.</p>
<p>This was a key component of our argument: the burden China has to bear to support the system would rise, until it exceeded even China?s threshhold for pain - though the pain in this case is rather abstract. The pain comes from the growing gap between the coast and the interior and resulting social tensions from China?s unbalanced growth, future financial losses and difficulties keeping surging reserves from leading to a surge in the money supply. Jonathan Anderson of UBS estimates that China?s money supply should grow by about $70b a year, any reserve growth in excess of $70 b needs to be sterilized. If China?s reserves grew by $40 b in May (this is a pure guess), and 75% of those reserve were invested in dollars that provides $30 b of financing to the US. The US needs about $65-70 b in monthly financing to cover its current account deficit, so China?s central bank ALONE would be supplying just under 1/2 the needed financing.</p>
<p>China says it does not want to give in to US pressure -- though I would note it also did not move when the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/26/business/worldbusiness/26cnd-yuan.html" type="external">Bush Administration</a>refrained from public pressure. But if China tries to "punish" the US for its public criticism by holding on to its peg, China, in effect, has to keep on financing the US at a low rate. Rather than kow-towing to US demands to change its currency, China will just keep writing large checks to buy low-yielding US securities ...</p>
<p>However, I think Nouriel and I did miss a couple of things in our Bretton Woods Two paper.</p>
<p>1) US assets could become more attractive relative to European assets if European interest rates fell sharply, not just if US interest rates rose. On the short-end, US rates have risen while European rates have stayed constant. On the <a href="http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000039&amp;amp;refer=columnist_baum&amp;amp;sid=aKYcCy8UTmdE#" type="external">long-end</a>, US rates certainly have not risen (hence, <a href="http://economistsview.blogspot.com/2005/05/three-discussions-of-low-long-rate.html" type="external">the conundrum</a>), but <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/bb4d11c0-cd22-11d9-aa26-00000e2511c8.html" type="external">European rates have fallen</a>. Bunds now yield 3.3% -- well below Treasuries.</p>
<p>2) China?s lending curbs could make it easier -- at least for a while -- for the PBoC to sterilize substantial reserve inflows by issuing sterilization bills that pay relatively little (perhaps less than China earns on its reserves). Chinese bank deposits are increasing rapidly, but the PBoC?s administrative controls have crimped the banks? capacity to lend. The result: the banks use their spare cash to buy the PBoC?s sterilization bonds, and are willing to do so at a very lost cost. China has kept its deposit rate absurdly low to increase the profitability of the state banks, allowing the banks to write off some NPLs with ongoing profits (low deposit rates also helped keep lending rates low, and low lending rates and a growing economy make it pretty easy for firms to cover at least the interest on their loans, keeping NPLs low ... ). But as the banks buy more and more PBoC bills that yield about what they pay on deposits, their profits will fall -- relying on administrative controls to keep sterilization costs down has a price, even if that price is not immediately obvious. And as the pace of China?s reserve accumulation accelerates, that price will only grow.</p>
<p>However, our argument did not hinge entirely on the possibility that the world?s central banks would tire of financing the US, and slow the pace of their dollar reserve accumulation. The same imbalances that led to rapid central bank reserve accumulation were also generating growing strains on certain sectors of the US and European economies, strains that could easily be expected to give rise to protectionist pressure. That part of the argument certainly has been born out. There is a risk that the US will tire (at least <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/26/AR2005052601854.html" type="external">politically</a>) of Chinese imports before China tires of financing the US.</p>
<p>(Continues)This year, China is likely to import about $50 b -- maybe less -- of US goods, and $200b, maybe more, of US debt (assuming China?s reserves increase by $300b, and 2/3s of those reserves are invested in dollars). That is an unusual pattern of trade. I do not doubt for a second that many parts of the US benefit from this trade as well: the PBoC?s willingness to buy US debt -- treasuries, agencies, mortgage backed securities, even corporate bonds -- has helped <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/27/opinion/27krugman.html?hp" type="external">the Fed support US consumption</a> after the stock market bubble burst by generating a bit of real estate froth.</p>
<p>However, American who bought homes in San Diego (or all of California), Miami (and much of Florida), DC, New York, and elsewhere on the Eastern Seaboard generally don?t attribute the capital gain on their home to China?s willingness to finance the US, and thus to cover up the consequences of the US "savings" deficit. They certainly are not using their capital gains to write large checks to help out those losing jobs in the manufacturing sector. And remember, when a factory closes in a small town, the impact on town is profound: the small town usually is left with more houses than jobs, and that pushes down local real estate prices -- leaving those who lost their job with a smaller financial cushion from their "home equity" as well. Maytag employs 1/5 of the population of Newton Ohio, so shifting the Maytag plant to China would have a profound impact on the local real estate market (See the C1 story in the Wall Street Journal).</p>
<p>I think this raises a set of very real issues -- issues that go beyond the typical debate about trade liberalization. The underlying assumption behind most trade debates is that jobs lost in sectors that compete with imports will be offset in large part by new jobs in exporting sectors. The baseline assumption is that imports will be paid for by exports -- and there will be a shift from one "tradable" sector to another.</p>
<p>That does not seem to be what is happening now -- at least in the US. There is a shift out of sectors that compete with imports, particularly imports from China -- <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB111715963065744872,00.html?mod=todays_us_page_one" type="external">socks</a>, washing machines, auto parts, furniture (the less glamorous parts of the US economy centered in the Midwest and the South) -- into the real estate sector, and other sectors sheltered from external competition. That is the consequence of balancing higher imports with more exports of "debt securities -- IOUs" rather than "goods and services."</p>
<p>As China?s global trade surplus rises, it is becoming clear that the US "savings deficit" (private as well as public) is matched by an equally large "consumption deficit" in China. As a result, the large US trade deficit is increasingly matched, now that China?s investment boom has cooled a bit, by a large Chinese trade surpluses (I am talking about both countries overall deficits and surpluses, not their bilateral deficit/ surplus). China?s is now big player in the world economy, despite still being a poor country: its goods exports (end 2004) were about 75% of US goods exports, and they are rising fast.</p>
<p>The emergence of large trade surpluses in one major part of the world economy -- and extremely large, sustained trade deficits in another big part of the world economy -- is, I suspect, a real challenge to the global trade regime. I "buy" John Gerald Ruggie?s " <a href="http://www.mpi-fg-koeln.mpg.de/pu/workpap/wp97-1/wp97-1.html" type="external">embedded liberalism</a>" thesis. In the post-war period, trade liberalization was matched by a set of other policy changes that took some of the edge off creative destruction. Policies like social security and its equivalents in Europe, Europe?s public health care system, Japan?s system of lifetime employment and counter-cyclical macroeconomic policies to limit the business cycle.</p>
<p>One of the system?s unwritten norms, I would argue, was that the major players did not run current account deficits (or surpluses) or more than 5% of GDP. In the 1980s, the big battle between the US and Japan came when the US current account deficit was about 3% of GDP. Japan has run a sustained current account surplus for some time, but not a 5% of GDP surplus. Some resource exporters have run large current account surpluses, but not, I think, the world?s major manufacturing economies. With two major players the US and China now running deficits and surpluses on a scale that I suspect are unprecedented for major players in the world economy, it is no shock the global trading system is under <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0526/p02s01-usfp.html" type="external">a bit of strain</a>.</p>
<p>You can argue that the traditional goods for goods trade left some potential gains from trade off the table, since it meant that savings short -- or investment rich -- countries were not generally running large external deficits, and importing large amounts of capital from abroad (though certainly no one anticipated that large gains from trade would come from the export of the savings of poor countries to rich countries). But the traditional goods for goods (or services for services) trade also simplified the external adjustment process -- growing imports were matched by growing exports, and growing employment in the export sector.</p>
<p>The current pattern of trade implies a large shift of resources out of the US tradables goods sector now (see this <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/may2005/nf20050526_9898_db042.htm" type="external">Business Week article</a>), as the US runs up its external debt at an accelerating rate. But then -- probably within five and certainly within ten years -- the trend will have to reverse itself: there will need to be a large shift out of real estate and back into tradable goods production. No country can run large trade deficits for long without running up its external debt levels to levels that are difficult to sustain: on current trends, barring unanticipated valuation gains on US assets, the US external debt to GDP ratio will be well above 40% of GDP by 2008 -- a very high level relative to US exports.</p>
<p>My point: it is not surprising that the unprecedented US savings deficit and Chinese consumption deficit (and resulting US current account deficit that is now heading towards 7% of GDP and Chinese current account surplus that looks likely to exceed 7% of China?s 2005 GDP) is putting real strains on the trading system. Deficits and surpluses of this scale in major parts of the world economy challenge the norms of the post-war system -- and challenge domestic political compromises that enabled post-war trade liberalization. Even if deficits and surpluses of this size are economically sustainable, they may not be politically sustainable.</p>
<p>UPDATE: interesting <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/05/paul_krugman_ge.html" type="external">DeLong riff</a> that key?s off Krugman?s column. It touches on some of the themes discussed here, but in a shorter and punchier way ...</p>

<p>I?ll try to chime in with some thoughts on Bretton Woods two late tomorrow -- [UPDATE -- MAKE THAT FRIDAY]</p>
<p>For the moment, though, I?ll just note that it is strange, at least to me, that the current account surpluses (savings surpluses) of the world?s resource exporting countries and many of the world?s biggest resource importing countries are both rising right now. An oil exporter might save the windfall from an unexpected price surge, but I would normally expect an oil importer -- including an oil importer like China -- to save a bit less. The net effect on the global savings surplus is a bit ambiguous.</p>
<p>Afterall, Asia?s economies are very dependent on imported raw materials, and those raw materials cost more today than in say 2002. That makes the current surge in Chinese savings all the more surprising ...</p>

<p>For Africa watchers, this morning?s attention is focused on Nigeria. Over the weekend, <a href="http://saharareporters.com/news-page/police-least-20-killed-militants-attack-igbo-town-hall-meeting-mubi-adamawa-state-ap" type="external">murder of Christians</a> continued, ostensibly by an Islamic radical group, Boko Haram. Various ?Christian? spokesmen have threatened retaliation against Muslims and mosques have been attacked. But, in some areas, there are grassroots efforts to forestall religious conflict, with <a href="http://ogala.wordpress.com/2012/01/04/kano-finds-religious-unity-in-subsidy-protest/" type="external">Christians protecting Muslims</a> while they pray and <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201201091716.html" type="external">Muslims guarding Christian churches</a>. While the nation has gone on strike, President Goodluck Jonathan sought to <a href="http://saferafricagroup.com/2012/01/07/broadcast-by-president-goodluck-jonathan-on-the-deregulation-of-the-downstream-petroleum-sector-saturday-7-january-2012/" type="external">mollify public anger</a> at his elimination of the fuel subsidy, including by <a href="http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=151888:salary-cut-jonathan-to-lose-n878000-yearly&amp;amp;catid=1:news&amp;amp;Itemid=2" type="external">cutting government salaries</a> (including his own). Preliminary reports are that the strike has shut-down Lagos, Abuja, and Kano and <a href="http://saharareporters.com/news-page/goodluck-jonathan%E2%80%99s-legacy-police-men-kill-three-lagos-two-kano" type="external">protestor deaths</a> are being reported from Lagos and Kano. I have heard nothing from Port Harcourt and the oil patch except that police allegedly <a href="http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/01/bayelsa-residents-shun-anti-fuel-subsidy-removal-protest/" type="external">prevented a protest</a> from taking place in Bayelsa state. Personalities ranging from the president to literary icon <a href="http://www.thenigerianvoice.com/nvnews/79333/1/nigerian-authors-want-political-leadership-to-arre.html" type="external">Chinua Achebe</a> are saying that the <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/01/08/nigeria-unrest-worse-than-1960s-civil-war-president/" type="external">current situation</a> recalls the run-up to the 1967-70 Biafra war. But, information is too incomplete, and too much is in flux for meaningful comment today.</p>
<p>So, instead of Nigeria, I want to return the focus to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the aftermath of the November presidential elections. To recap: the incumbent, Joseph Kabila, defeated challenger Etienne Tshisekedi in elections characterized as ?too flawed to be credible? by international and domestic observers, including the Roman Catholic Church, which had some thirty thousand observers in the field. The DRC supreme court, seen as in the pocket of Kabila, upheld the incumbent?s victory. Tshisekedi bitterly contested the announced results, and went so far as to have himself <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16314871" type="external">sworn in</a> as president at about the same time as Kabila?s ceremony. The stage appeared to be set for a major clash that could re-ignite civil war.</p>
<p>Yet, as of now, little has happened. The international community, with little stomach for further intervention in Congo, restricted itself to calling for ? <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201201051063.html" type="external">dialogue</a>,? far from the robust stand it took in the Ivory Coast standoff between Alassane Ouattara and Laurent Gbagbo that resulted in a civil war. But, in Congo, while there continues to be high levels of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/06/world/africa/congo-45-civilians-killed-in-south-kivu.html?partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss" type="external">violence</a>, especially in the east, it does not seem to be related directly to the election results, and the population appears to have moved on. Only the Congolese Diaspora has been vocal. Of course, the international and domestic reactions probably re-enforce each other: the international community is unlikely to move when there is little domestic reaction, and domestic reaction may be more muted because of the tepid international voice.</p>
<p>Future developments might ignite a stronger popular reaction. But, for now, how to account for the apparent passivity of the Congolese population in the aftermath of flawed elections? Part of the answer may be Kabila?s relatively skillful use of repression ? enough to paralyze the opposition but not so much that it produced a backlash. More fundamentally, as Adam Nossiter <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/world/africa/in-congolese-capital-power-cut-applies-to-food.html?partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss" type="external">pointed out</a> in the New York Times, the deep and pervasive poverty of the Congolese population means that most people are more concerned about feeding their families than about political activity or flawed election results.</p>
<p>Of necessity, this is speculation. But the question is worth asking. Why are some populations quiescent following flawed or stolen elections (Nigeria in 2007 and Congo now) while in others there is violent protest and the prospect of civil war (Kenya in 2007 or Zimbabwe in 2008). In Nigeria and Congo, the population historically has been largely alienated from government ? any government. (In 2011, this may have changed in some parts of Nigeria, but not others.) In Kenya and Zimbabwe, with greater institutional development, however, government historically has mattered more to people. Maybe that has something to do with the different reactions to flawed elections, along with ethnic rivalries and a host of other issues. lt is an endlessly repeated clich? that African countries are all different ? and their response to seemingly similar political developments reflects their own specific history and circumstances.</p>

<p>Anger at President Goodluck Jonathan?s elimination of the fuel subsidy appears to have united Nigerians in a way not seen for many years. There have been <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201201060570.html" type="external">popular protests</a> in virtually all of Nigeria?s major cities. According to the Nigerian press, protestors have shut-down economic activity in Lagos, Ibadan, and Kano. In the capital, Abuja, most gas stations are closed. It is likely that road haulage will decline in the face of a tripling of gasoline prices since the end of the fuel subsidy-- most Nigerian goods move by road. It remains to be seen when or if civil aviation will be affected.</p>
<p>In Kano, the metropolis of the predominately Muslim North, the protest was accompanied by a reported <a href="http://saharareporters.com/news-page/kano-%E2%80%9Ctahrir-square%E2%80%9D-protest-turns-violent-42-hurt-christians-and-muslims-said-reach-mutua" type="external">accord</a> between Christians and Muslims. There are news <a href="http://ogala.wordpress.com/2012/01/04/kano-finds-religious-unity-in-subsidy-protest/" type="external">photos</a> of Christians providing protection while Muslim protestors pray, and Muslims returning the favor?this in a city that has been a byword for religious hatred and Islamic radicalism. The Kano protestors are demanding restoration of the fuel subsidy and the firing of Minister of Finance Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and the governor of the central bank (a Muslim from the North), Lamido Sanusi. The powerful Nigeria Bar Association and the National Medical Association are <a href="http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=151777:you-must-join-monday-strike-nba-tells-lawyers&amp;amp;catid=1:news&amp;amp;Itemid=2" type="external">supporting</a> organized labor?s <a href="http://sweetcrudereports.com/2012/01/05/nigerian-doctors-to-join-in-fuel-subsidy-protest/" type="external">call</a> for a general strike next week. It remains to be seen whether unions in the oil industry will participate. If they do, they have the capacity to shut-down Nigeria?s oil production. In Lagos, apparently some of the police, who are widely hated, <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201201032450.html" type="external">joined the protests</a>. I have seen no evidence thus far that they have been joined by soldiers.</p>
<p>Is this the long-awaited Nigerian Spring? The conventional wisdom (which I shared but increasingly doubt) is that the country was too divided by religion and ethnicity and with too weak a sense of national identity for a popular opposition movement comparable to those that roiled Tunisia, Egypt or Syria. Yet, the protests are nationwide and peaceful; thus far, casualties have been <a href="http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=151772:protester-killed-in-kano-nba-impeach-jonathan-if&amp;amp;catid=1:news&amp;amp;Itemid=2" type="external">caused</a> by the security services, not the protestors. In some cases, protestors have organized themselves through the use of social media. Protestors in Kano are explicitly invoking the Arab Spring and the Occupy Wall Street movement. They refer to their encampment as ? <a href="http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/01/occupy-kano-protesters-file-n500m-suit-against-jonathan/" type="external">Occupy Kano</a>? and its venue as ? <a href="http://saharareporters.com/news-page/occupy-nigeria-activists-set-tahrir-square-kano-city" type="external">Tahir Square</a>.?</p>
<p>Nigeria ?at least for the moment ? may be transforming itself before our very eyes. Enough is new to make the past an inadequate guide to the future.</p>
<p>What will the Jonathan government do? One answer would be immediately to restore the fuel subsidy and fire Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. (There are press reports that Okonjo-Iweala will resign anyway if Jonathan backs down, which she has since <a href="http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=151783:ngozi-abati-dismiss-resignation-claims&amp;amp;catid=1:news&amp;amp;Itemid=2" type="external">denied</a>.) If done over the next day or two, the protestors might be deprived of their oxygen. But, if the Jonathan administration does back down, it will appear weak and vacillating, with unpredictable consequences for the grass roots rebellion in the North labeled ?Boko Haram? or the possible resurgence of militant activity in the oil-rich Niger Delta. If, however, the government responds with repression (as it has done without success against Boko Haram in the North), the result could be further inflammation of public opinion and much higher levels of violence. Jonathan appears pinned by Morton?s Fork.</p>
<p>If sustained, the protests create the potential for profound change in Nigeria?s political economy. Christians providing protection for Muslims while they pray, and vice versa, could suck the air out of radical religious movements such as ?Boko Haram?. The protests also raise the potential for Nigerians demanding a level of accountability from their government which would be new?and salutary?in a country that normally is a leader in the corruption indices.</p>

<p>The statement is often made that the 2006 and 2011 were Congo?s first since 1960. There is a collective amnesia concerning the relatively acceptably conducted national elections in 1965, carried out under the provisions of a new constitution completed in Kananga in mid-1964, and approved by referendum (with North Katanga and a few territories still occupied by rebels and not voting). By late spring 1965, the rebellions were mostly over, and balloting occurred nation-wide for national and provincial assemblies. Some 223 parties competed, linked in two broad (and loose) alliances, one tied to then PM Moise Tshombe, and the other linked to President Joseph Kasavubu. A parliamentary impasse resulted, creating the pretext for the November 1965 Mobutu coup.</p>
<p>Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the elections were entirely conducted by the Congolese; the UN operation ended in mid-1964. Not only did this measure the far greater capacities of the Congo state at the time, but also the degree of infrastructural decay since; it was still possible to move around the country in 1965. None of the accounts of the elections mention a cost factor; they certainly did not require anything remotely resembling the reported $700 million for the much less credible 2011 version.</p>
<p>For detail, see especially the invaluable yearbook of Congo developments, "Congo 1965" (Brussels: CRISP, 1966). The Young-Turner volume, "The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State," has a brief account (pp. 49-51).</p>

<p>Debate continues to rage in Nigeria over President Jonathan?s intention to remove fuel subsidies. Business Day Online cites a former Nigerian official as <a href="http://businessdayonline.com/NG/index.php/news/111-politics/31193-jonathan-fuel-subsidy-and-the-looming-anarchy" type="external">saying</a>, ?there is never a time the level of anger in society has risen to what is obtainable now.? Could anger over the threatened removal of the popular fuel subsidy be the catalyst that provokes broad-scale unrest?</p>
<p>In the past, observers have said that sustained protest in Nigeria is unlikely because ordinary Nigerians cannot afford to take too much time away from work. But technology may have changed the equation. Bill Wasik <a href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/12/ff_riots/all/1" type="external">writes</a> in ?Crowd Control,? in the January 2012 issue of Wired magazine, that, ?Today?s protests, revolts, and riots are self-organizing, hyper-networked?and headed for a city near you.? He notes in cases in North Africa, UK, the US, and elsewhere, that for these protesting groups, ?suddenly coalescing into a crowd feels like stepping out from the shadows, like forcing society to respect the numbers that they now know themselves to command.?</p>
<p>In the US example, ?street protesters were merely the visible symbol of the giant, subterranean mob of Americans struggling to get by.? ?What?s really revolutionary about all these gatherings?what remains both dangerous and magnificent about them?is the way they represent a disconnected group getting connected, a mega-underground casting off its invisibility to embody itself, formidably, in physical space.?</p>
<p>But for this to happen, ?for tech to become effective as a tool for civil disorder,? Wasik explains, ?it first had to insinuate itself into people?s daily lives.? Has this happened in Nigeria? Perhaps the process is further along than most realize. The telecom industry in Nigeria is robust and it is paralleled by a youth bulge, largely unemployed, but tech savvy. According to the <a href="http://www.ncc.gov.ng/industry-statistics/subscriber-data.html" type="external">Nigerian Communications Commission</a>, there are over eighty-eight million active mobile phones in Nigeria. Nigeria also has an Occupy <a href="http://youtu.be/ayiTqfdOh1o" type="external">movement</a>, though little is reported about it. The stage appears to be set.</p>

<p>Prof. Jean Herskovits, a professor of history at the State University of New York, Purchase, and a distinguished Africanist, has issued a salutary warning against U.S. involvement in a Nigerian ?war on terror? involving Boko Haram in a January 2 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/02/opinion/in-nigeria-boko-haram-is-not-the-problem.html?_r=1&amp;amp;emc=eta1" type="external">New York Times op-ed</a>.</p>
<p>Professor Herskovits is responding to the bombings over the Christmas weekend allegedly by Boko Haram, earlier <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/ap-interview-us-general-sees-nigeria-terror-145747780.html" type="external">statements</a> by U.S. Africa Command commander General Carter Ham on the threat of terrorism in northern Nigeria, a recent House Committee on Homeland Security report titled ? <a href="http://homeland.house.gov/hearing/subcommittee-hearing-boko-haram-emerging-threat-us-homeland" type="external">Boko Haram: Emerging Threat to the U.S. Homeland</a>,? and proposals to place Boko Haram on the U.S. foreign terrorist organization list.</p>
<p>She says, ?there is no proof that that a well-organized ideologically coherent terrorist group called Boko Haram even exists today.?</p>
<p>I concur with her argument that an apparent U.S. bias toward President Jonathan?s government in Abuja and support for a Nigerian ?war on terror? risks alienating Nigeria?s Muslims ? half of the population of sub-Saharan Africa?s largest state.</p>
<p>What is ?Boko Haram?? It has no charismatic leader, nobody has ever met its purported ?spokesmen,? it appears to have no politburo, and it has issued no definitive manifesto. Yet, the Abuja government ? and much of the domestic and international media ? assigns responsibility to it for virtually every violent episode in northern Nigeria, as Prof. Herskovits observes.</p>
<p>The violence in northern Nigeria is real, horrific, and growing. But, rather than thinking about Boko Haram as a terrorist organization to be countered through traditional security measures, perhaps it would be more realistic to view it as a grass-roots revolt with many players and motivations and little coherence in the context of a political system that has done little to address poverty and promote social justice. No doubt it includes criminal elements, and politicians will seek to exploit the disaffection associated with it to advance their own agendas. But that does not make it an organization appropriate for a terrorist list.</p>
<p>The Abuja government should view Boko Haram as a political issue reflecting regional grievances, rather than exclusively as a security challenge. But, the Jonathan government?s ending of the longstanding <a href="http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/nigerians-protest-removal-of-fuel-subsidy/106373/" type="external">fuel subsidy</a> on January 1 will likely discourage a change of course. Already fuel costs have <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201201020006.html" type="external">increased</a> by 116 percent. Whatever the long-term benefits, in the short-term there will be an increase in popular misery. Yesterday, there were demonstrations against the ending of the subsidy in many of Nigeria?s cities, including Lagos, Kano, and Abuja. In the face of popular anger, Nigeria?s largely moribund trade union movement may acquire a new lease on life and civil society organizations could re-energize. Student and faculty groups are also supporting the demonstrations. With pressure from the National Assembly, the government may yet back down.</p>
<p>The fuel subsidy issue is not directly related to Boko Haram, but in the face of popular opposition to it, the concern must be that the Jonathan administration will more likely circle the wagons than engage in fresh thinking about grievances in the North.</p>

<p>While I had said I would not post again until January 3, I felt this weekend?s attacks in Nigeria warranted a response.</p>
<p>?Boko Haram?, a highly de-centralized Islamic radical movement, has allegedly claimed responsibility for attacks on <a href="http://saharareporters.com/news-page/nigeria-christmas-day-car-bombing-kill-least-20-catholic-church-niger-state" type="external">Christian churches</a> in an Abuja suburb and <a href="http://www.zimtelegraph.com/?p=16272&amp;amp;utm_source=rss&amp;amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;amp;utm_campaign=3-more-explosions-rock-yobe" type="external">elsewhere</a> in the <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201112270558.html" type="external">North</a> and the <a href="http://saharareporters.com/news-page/xmas-day-bombings-another-bomb-blast-hits-second-church-nigerias-restive-city-jos" type="external">Middle Belt</a> over the Christmas weekend. Reports of incidents and casualties are incomplete. However, estimates of civilian casualties range up to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/25/world/africa/in-nigerias-north-deadly-clashes-with-boko-haram.html?partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss" type="external">seventy</a> and there are reports that the security services also <a href="http://elombah.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=9219:59-boko-haram-members-3-soldiers-six-others-killed-in-damaturu-attack&amp;amp;catid=1:latest-news&amp;amp;Itemid=67" type="external">killed</a> about sixty suspected members of Boko Haram in Yobe state.</p>
<p>While Boko Haram has murdered Christian clergy and attacked churches before, it has primarily targeted representatives of state and federal governments, such as police officers, soldiers,&amp;#160; politicians, and even traditional Muslim leaders.</p>
<p>Boko Haram may be intent on showing Nigerians and the international community that it can make the country ungovernable for President Goodluck Jonathan?s predominately southern Christian administration in Abuja. Attacks on Christian churches on one of the two principal Christian holidays of the year drive that point home and ensured international press attention. For example, some American media paired the attacks with Pope Benedict XVI?s <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/europe/Pope-Benedict-Calls-for-End-to-Syria-Bloodshed-in-Christmas-Message-136202293.html" type="external">call for peace</a>--thereby introducing Boko Haram to parts of the international community that hitherto had not been paying much attention.</p>
<p>Boko Haram may also seek to demonstrate that it can strike anywhere--and some Western media seem to draw that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/world/africa/explosion-rips-through-catholic-church-in-nigeria.html?partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss" type="external">conclusion</a>. In fact, the Christmas attacks did not take place in areas outside of Boko Haram?s usual theater of operations. Boko Haram has claimed responsibility for attacks in Abuja and Damaturu previously. Similar bombings happened on the Christmas holiday <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201012280145.html" type="external">last year</a> in Jos, which has been the center of local and religious and ethnic conflict for a decade, and whose Christian governor is widely unpopular among the state?s Muslim population. Notably, an alleged spokesman for Boko Haram cited revenge for killings of Muslims and the government?s refusal to protect Muslims to <a href="http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=150861:boko-haram-claims-responsibility&amp;amp;catid=1:news&amp;amp;Itemid=2" type="external">justify</a> the bombing.</p>
<p>Boko Haram may seek to provoke retaliatory Christian killings of Muslims outside of the North, thereby promoting the fragmentation of the country. Fringe groups in the Niger Delta have already <a href="http://pointblanknews.com/new/exclusive/3240-we-will-kill-all-muslims-in-niger-delta-militant-group-warns.html" type="external">threatened</a> to kill Northern Muslims living in that region, and the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), the mainstream Christian umbrella group, has said that Christians should " <a href="http://saharareporters.com/news-page/boko-haram-attacks-can-asks-whether-nigeria-can-survive-religious-war" type="external">defend themselves</a>." There is anecdotal evidence that some Northern Muslims living in southern states have returned home out of fear.</p>
<p>Finally, the Christmas attacks may indicate that Boko Haram is increasingly identifying Christianity with the Jonathan government, and possibly with the hated police and security services. A White House spokesman has stated that the United States " <a href="http://mobile.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-25/nigeria-church-explosion-leaves-many-casualties-emergency-services-say?category=%2Fnews%2Fafrica%2F" type="external">pledges to assist</a>" the Nigerian federal government in "bringing those responsible to justice."</p>
<p>Such identification of the United States with the Jonathan administration may result in Boko Haram attacks on American targets. However, there are few of them to be found in those parts of Nigeria where Boko Haram has operated up to now.</p>
<p>What does Boko Haram want? As a diffuse movement, there is no charismatic leader, no ?politburo?, and no manifesto. Boko Haram rhetoric is focused on the application off Islamic religious law and justice for the poor. But, it doubtlessly includes nihilistic and criminal elements as well. A common thread appears to be hatred for the secular government in Abuja, certain governors, and parts of the traditional Islamic establishment it sees as having sold out.</p>
<p>It is premature to see the Christmas attacks as more coordinated than those carried out by Boko Haram in the past. Nor do they necessarily indicate enhanced relations between Boko Haram and international jihadist movements, as some commentators are <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/west/Boko-Haram-Seen-Linked-to-Other-African-Terror-Groups--136260858.html" type="external">concluding</a>. Boko Haram seems to be financing itself through bank robberies and is arming itself by thefts from government armories and purchases -- there is no shortage of weapons on the market in Nigeria. So, it is not necessary to look for a "foreign hand" to account for Boko Haram?s current operations.</p>

<p>This is a guest post by <a href="http://aschharwood.blogspot.com/" type="external">Asch Harwood</a>, Council on Foreign Relations Africa research associate. Follow him on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/aschlfod" type="external">@aschlfod</a>.</p>
<p>Development agencies, multinationals, NGOs, private investors, and politicians regularly tout the potential of large scale agricultural investment for development and&amp;#160; food security--a point emphasized by the World Bank?s 2008 World Development Report, ? <a href="http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/EXTWDRS/EXTWDR2008/0,,contentMDK:21410054%7EmenuPK:3149676%7EpagePK:64167689%7EpiPK:64167673%7EtheSitePK:2795143,00.html" type="external">Agriculture for Development</a>.?</p>
<p>On the surface, this seems to make sense, particularly for Africa. Agriculture is already a central part of most developing economies. It accounts for around 34 percent of GDP and 64 percent of employment in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the World Bank. Further, agriculture has significant room for growth given the low rates of productivity and automation.</p>
<p>However, multinational investments in agriculture in the world?s newest state of South Sudan are raising questions about the need to balance the interests of investors with the interests of communities where those investments are taking place.</p>
<p>A&amp;#160; report last month by the Financial Times <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/dde59072-061e-11e1-a079-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1hBEmtT4I" type="external">suggests</a> that investments, not structured properly, could have the opposite effect envisioned by the World Bank, <a href="http://usaid.gov/press/releases/2011/pr111109_1.html" type="external">USAID</a>, and other donors pushing agricultural investment. This FT article focuses on the example of Egyptian private equity firm Citadel Capital, which has leased 259,000 acres, and has made a twenty-four million dollar investment but so far has only employed sixty people, most of whom are Zimbabwean.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.oaklandinstitute.org/understanding-land-investment-deals-africa-south-sudan" type="external">Oakland Institute</a> and <a href="http://www.npaid.org/en/news/?module=Articles&amp;amp;action=Article.publicShow&amp;amp;ID=18459" type="external">Norwegian People?s Aid</a> both have published reports outlining a number of other deals. And both raise serious concerns. As the author of the NPA report notes, ?While in theory, this influx of investment could provide development opportunities for rural communities, without the appropriate procedures in place there is a danger that it will serve to undermine livelihoods.?</p>
<p>The next blog post will appear on January 3. Happy Holidays!</p>

<article id="0000827" published-at="2018-02-06" title="How big data is helping states kick poor people off welfare"><p>Technology is being used to target and punish poor people in America, according to a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAutomating-Inequality-High-Tech-Profile-Police%2Fdp%2F1250074312" type="external">new book</a> by Virginia Eubanks, a professor of political science at the University of Albany, SUNY.</p>
<p>Here?s one example: In 2014, Maine Gov. Paul LePage <a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2014/01/07/politics/lepage-releases-ebt-data-showing-transactions-at-strip-clubs-bars-smoke-shops/" type="external">released data</a> to the public detailing over 3,000 transactions from welfare recipients using EBT cards in the state. (EBT cards are like state-issued debit cards, and can be used to disperse benefits like food stamps.)</p>
<p>LePage created a list of every time this money had been used in a strip club, liquor store, or bar, and used it to push his political agenda of limiting access to state benefits. LePage?s list represents a tiny fraction of overall EBT withdrawals, but it effectively reinforced <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/welfare-queen-myth/501470/" type="external">negative stereotypes and narratives</a> about who relies on welfare benefits and why.</p>
<p>I spoke with Eubanks recently about her new book, and why she believes automated technologies are being used to rig the welfare system against the people who need it the most.</p>
<p>A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.</p>
<p>What?s the thesis of your book?</p>
<p>There?s a collision of political forces and technical innovations that are devastating poor and working-class families in America.</p>
<p>The political forces I?m talking about are a backlash against racial justice victories and the scapegoating of immigrants. On the technical side, we have this explosion of technologies that go under the rubric of algorithmic decision-making or predictive modeling. These technologies increasingly decide who gets public services, who is denied public services, and how we monitor and police the most marginalized people in our society.</p>
<p>This feels so abstract when you lay it out like that. It?s hard to connect these technological innovations to what?s happening on the ground.</p>
<p>It does sound abstract, and it is hard to see the connections ? but they?re there. In the book, I try to tell stories about systems across the country and link them to concrete results in people?s lives. I talk about an automated eligibility system built in Indiana in 2006 that was supposed to automate the eligibility processes for all of their welfare services, but instead brought poor people under immense scrutiny. I talk about an electronic registry for the homeless in Los Angeles that has had similarly awful consequences. And on, and on, and on.</p>
<p>What?s different about this book is it?s told from the point of view of the people who are targets of these systems. I talked to designers and administrators, to folks who built the systems, but I also think it?s really important to hear the voices of those who are impacted directly. We don?t often hear these voices in stories about technology and political change.</p>
<p>So tell me how data-based technologies have changed the way public services are managed.</p>
<p>I don?t actually see the systems changing the way we think about public services or provide public services so much as I see them intensifying the way that we?re already providing services. They?re a really great diagnostic tool for when we have a social justice problem that we?re not addressing directly.</p>
<p>That?s interesting. Give me an example.</p>
<p>The 2006 Indiana system was built on two assumptions.</p>
<p>One was that most people who were in the public service system didn?t need to be there, and that if they just had a little push, they wouldn?t collect the resources that they were entitled to by law. The second assumption was that all case workers do is process paperwork and collude with folks who are requesting resources in order to defraud the system.</p>
<p>Basically, it was built on the assumption that the welfare system is rife with fraud and most people collecting resources don?t need them. That assumption turned into some very brittle rules that were part of the technological system, like a rule that said, basically, if you made any mistakes at all in your application (which can run anywhere from 35 to 120 pages), then you?ve failed to establish your eligibility and can be denied.</p>
<p>In other words, politicians are making a value judgment that the welfare system is itself a scam, and most of the people relying on it are fraudsters.</p>
<p>Precisely. And they?re designing the technologies to produce the results they want: less and less people getting the resources they need.</p>
<p>You cover a lot of individual stories in the book. Can you tell just one of them here to give people a sense of what you mean?</p>
<p>One story is about a guy named Gary who has been living on the streets on Skid Row, Los Angeles, on and off for 10 years. He?s trying to get access to housing through a system there called the <a href="https://www.lahsa.org/ces/" type="external">Coordinated Entry System</a>.</p>
<p>The Coordinated Entry System is supposed to match the most vulnerable homeless folks with the most appropriate available housing. There?s this incredibly long and very intense survey called the VI-SPDAT that seeks to give people a vulnerability score, looking at how close to death or institutionalization or hospitalization a person is. The stated goal is to prioritize folks who are most vulnerable for available housing, which makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Here?s the issue: the questions on the survey are questions that can require unhoused people to admit to illegal activities. In fact, the more of these you admit to, the higher you score on this survey, and the more vulnerable the system sees you as. The problem is, this information is then shared with more than 168 different organizations, including the Los Angeles Police Department, which can access this data without a warrant or oversight.</p>
<p>So Gary is extremely vulnerable ? he?s over 60, has health problems, has been in and out of the criminal justice system. But instead of getting access to housing, which is the only reason he applied to this system, he ends up getting arrested for something he claims not to have done, and it?s partly because his name was flagged in this database as a suspect.</p>
<p>When he comes out of jail, he?s lost all of his resources. He?s lost his network of people he knew on the street, he?s lost his tent, he?s lost all of his paperwork. But the system actually now will see him as less vulnerable, because it counts jail as housing ? it would see him as being housed for the last six months. He?s become lower priority.</p>
<p>So these systems are getting more efficient at denying people the help they need and at the same time bringing them under more and more scrutiny?</p>
<p>That?s exactly right. There?s this double-edged sword of system integration. On one level, it?s incredibly difficult to navigate the public services system. You have to fill out a million applications. If you want home heating assistance, food stamps, cash assistance, you have to fill out a separate application for each of these.</p>
<p>Integrating these systems could be a very positive thing for people if it were set up to provide people with the resources they need to meet basic human needs, but that?s not what we have. The system we have has been set up to pass moral judgment on people because it works on the assumption that poor people are poor because of some personal failure on their part.</p>
<p>It?s also about creating a network of information between agencies that makes it harder for people to get the help they need, but does a very good job of using their personal data to create new barriers for them.</p>
<p>And marginalized groups are more exposed to this system of surveillance precisely because they need to access the benefits and programs connected to it?</p>
<p>And because they live in what I think of as low-rights environments. The kinds of scrutiny that happens in poor working class neighborhoods, or in communities of color, or in migrant communities ? those processes of surveillance are much more intense in those neighborhoods. They?re overrepresented in all of these databases because they access public resources, but also because their communities are <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/04/how-big-data-harms-poor-communities/477423/" type="external">oversurveilled</a>.</p>
<p>Then, because we have this data, we create new tools that only focus on them and we reproduce this feedback cycle, what the <a href="https://stoplapdspying.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Statement-of-Concern-on-Upturn-Predictive-Policing-Report-December-2016.pdf" type="external">Stop LAPD Spying Coalition</a> calls the feedback loop of injustice.</p>
<p>Are poor people basically being used as guinea pigs in preparation for a much broader use of these technologies?</p>
<p>I think that?s absolutely true. In one of the early parts in the book, I write about a previous project I did that focused primarily on families on public assistance in my hometown, in Troy, New York. A real wake-up moment for me was when I was sitting with a young mother and we were talking about technology and her use of the public assistance EBT debit cards. I told her that I?ve heard people say they like EBT cards because they?re convenient and more efficient.</p>
<p>She said, ?Sure, it?s nice to not have to carry around food stamps, but it?s also invasive because my case worker uses it to track where I buy food and spend money.?</p>
<p>She then told me, ?You middle-class folks should watch out, because you?re going to be under the microscope next.? This was in 2000. I think there?s good reason to expect that these tools we?re talking about will be used far more broadly in the future.</p>
<p>Are we entering a kind of soft, digital tyranny that is too nebulous or distant for most of us to notice?</p>
<p>That?s a difficult question. I think that these tools allow us a moment to think deeply about what we allow government agencies to do on our behalf. These tools are incredible indicators of what we already think, both about poor working-class communities and families, and about government.</p>
<p>Ultimately, these systems make our values visible to us in a way that calls us to a moral reckoning. A lot of readers want me to give a 10-point plan for creating better technologies for public services, but I?ve resisted doing that because I think the real solution for us as a nation is to get our souls right about poverty. Until we do that, we will continue to produce systems that profile and punish poor and working families.</p></article>
<article id="0000831" published-at="2017-03-11" title="Want to toss out pollution-fighting rules? You?ll have to face California first."><p>This <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/want-gut-emission-rules-prepare-war-california/" type="external">story</a> was originally published by <a href="http://www.wired.com/" type="external">Wired</a>&amp;#160;and is reproduced here as part of the <a href="http://climatedesk.org/" type="external">Climate Desk</a> collaboration.</p>
<p>In its ongoing jihad against federal regulations, the Trump administration has indicated some interest in targeting the ones that attempt to fight <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/climate-change" type="external">climate change</a>. First in its sights: a funky law that gives the state of <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/california" type="external">California</a> the right to make its own rules on automotive emissions. But because of the way laws and business work, the California exemption is one of the most powerful environmental tools in the world.</p>
<p>So California?s not going down without a fight.</p>
<p>A quick history lesson: When legislators wrote the 1963 Clean Air Act, they acknowledged that California already had pollution-fighting rules, and that its environmental situation was especially dire. So they gave the state the right to write its own, stricter standards.</p>
<p>?It?s hard to overstate how important the ability for California to set its standards has been to public health and clean air over the past 40 years,? says Don Anair, deputy director for the clean vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ?Time and again, California?s been willing and able to move forward.?</p>
<p>From unleaded gasoline to catalytic converters to counting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions in vehicle standards, the Golden State has played a key role. That?s because, as Therese Langer, transportation program director at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, puts it, ?California doesn?t just mean California.? Even though California is the only state that can write its own rules, under Section 177 of the Clean Air Act, any state looking for more than the federal package of regulations can opt to follow California?s auto standards.</p>
<p>Today, 13 (mostly northeastern) states and Washington, D.C., have adopted California?s extra-stringent emissions standards. Nine states also follow Cali?s mandate that automakers sell <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/electric-vehicles" type="external">zero-emission vehicles</a>. Together, they account for nearly 30 percent of new car sales in the country ? and no carmaker wants to build ?California cars? and ?rest of the world cars.? Result: ?All cars meet the California standard,? says Rebecca Lindland, an analyst at Kelley Blue Book.</p>
<p>But if American carmakers are good at anything, it?s complaining about regulations that demand it produce cleaner, more efficient cars. The anti-regulation, climate change?doubting Trump administration seems to sympathize. But California?s waiver makes it hard for the feds to weaken anything. Trump?s team could have the EPA review the standards that govern cars through 2025, standards the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/01/epa-locks-fuel-economy-rules-trump-cant-rip/" type="external">agency finalized just a week before Obama left office</a>. It would take years, likely face a legal challenge, and would require the EPA prove all the scientific data supporting its original decision is no longer valid.</p>
<p>And even if the EPA won, the California exemption would still hold, and carmakers would still have to make cars that met it. So you can see why the Golden State is a key target. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/05/business/detroit-automakers-emissions-standards.html" type="external">The New York Times reports</a>:&amp;#160;?Automakers are also hopeful that the new EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, will begin legal action to revoke California?s ability to enforce its tailpipe standards.? Asked in his Senate confirmation hearing if he would leave the waiver process alone, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-pol-epa-confirmation-20170118-story.html" type="external">Pruitt said</a>, ?I don?t know without going through the process to determine that. One would not want to presume the outcome.?</p>
<p>Good news for environmental cheerleaders: Stripping California of its special status would require a change to the Clean Air Act ? the kind of legislating a Democratic filibuster could derail.</p>
<p>But, you say, the EPA doesn?t have to kill the waiver process if it just refuses to issue any new ones. It might even have the legal right to rescind already granted waivers. But California can fight back ? and it?s got a stocked arsenal.</p>
<p>?The statute is very clear. It says EPA shall grant the waiver,? says Cara Horowitz, co-executive director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA School of Law. The EPA can only hit the reject button if it can prove a requested rule is weaker than the federal standards, isn?t consistent with the Clean Air Act, or ?does not need such standards to meet compelling and extraordinary conditions.? Through the 1990s, Los Angeles smog conditions were severe enough to cancel after-school sports and flood emergency rooms ? compelling and extraordinary. Today, the motivating threat is climate change.</p>
<p>All that matters, because if Scott Pruitt?s EPA starts rejecting new waivers or revoking old ones, California can mount a legal challenge. ?I have no doubt that California would litigate, would sue EPA,? says Horowitz. Indeed, Gov. Jerry Brown pledged his state would defend its environmental and social programs. ?California is not turning back,? he <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-gov-jerry-brown-defiantly-tells-1485282907-htmlstory.html" type="external">said in a January speech</a>. ?Not now, not ever.?</p>
<p>What if Trump does start rolling back standards? ?We?ll see them in court,? says Roland Hwang, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council?s energy and transportation program.</p>
<p>California has on its side decades of legal precedent built from technical analysis. The EPA has outright rejected just one waiver out of nearly 100. That was in 2007, when the state wanted to restrict greenhouse gas emissions from passenger vehicles. The EPA said nope, the auto industry celebrated, and California prepared a lawsuit, but the Obama Administration swept in before the case played out. In May 2009, President Obama announced a settlement of sorts: the EPA ? not just California ? would include GHGs in new standards, and the (recently bailed out) auto industry would deliver cleaner cars.</p>
<p>With a new face in the White House, the auto industry seems willing to renege on that peace treaty. And California seems ready to go to war.</p></article>

<p>Status: &amp;#160; Multiple ? see below.</p>
<p>Example: &amp;#160; [Collected via e-mail, 2006]</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Because instead of tucking Adam into bed tonight, and leaning down to give him one last butterfly kiss?I am sitting in a jail cell. A jail cell where I?ve been sentenced to spend 10 years of my life for a ?crime? I didn?t commit!</p>
<p>Please ? let me explain.</p>
<p>I received over 25 letters of commendation and two awards during my years on the police force. But to the bureaucrats at the U.S. Department of Justice, that doesn?t matter. To them, I?m just a white police officer whose police dog bit an illegal immigrant on the leg in 1995.</p>
<p>You may have heard about my case on TV. On the night of September 21, 1995, I was on patrol with my police dog, Valk. The area I patrolled, Takoma Park, had been suffering a rash of burglaries. My partner, Sgt. Anthony Delozier, and I got a call for backup from an officer who had spotted two men on the roof of a nearby store. We knew we had likely found the perpetrators.</p>
<p>When we arrived, the situation was tense. The suspects, Ricardo Mendez and Herrera Cruz, had been ordered down from the roof and told to face a wall. They were shouting back and forth to each other in a stream of Spanish.</p>
<p>And then it happened.</p>
<p>Mendez made a move as if to flee the scene. In accordance with my training, I released my dog, Valk, who was trained to perform the standard ?bite and hold? move. He did so, biting Mendez on the leg and holding him until I and the other officers could handcuff him.</p>
<p>Both of the suspects were charged with 4th degree burglary. Cruz pled guilty and was deported to Mexico. Mendez was convicted of illegally entering the U.S. and selling crack cocaine and was deported to San Salvador. As for me, I was relieved to get two dangerous drug dealers off our streets.</p>
<p>So imagine my shock ? five years later ? when the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it would indict me for ?violating? Ricardo Mendez?s civil rights by allowing my police dog to bite his leg!</p>
<p>Mendez, a criminal and an illegal alien, had been fleeing the scene of a crime, and it had been my duty to release Valk and apprehend him. But the bureaucrats in the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice chose to ignore the facts; they were looking for cases of ?police brutality?, and I was exactly what they wanted: a white officer whose police dog had bitten a minority.</p>
<p>My fellow officers and I testified in court that I had done my job by the book. And it was true: the P.G. County police training clearly states that if a felony suspect makes a move, we are authorized to release our police dogs.</p>
<p>The jury agreed and voted to acquit me 11-1. And that?s when things really got ugly.</p>
<p>Civil rights groups were furious. Everyone from Amnesty International to the NAACP declared the arrest ?racist? and demanded further investigation. The Justice Department insisted on a second trial because of the one lone juror who had sided with the prosecution. They got it.</p>
<p>The second trial was a circus. The government flew in Mendez from San Salvador and Cruz from Mexico at taxpayer expense to testify against me. They stacked the jury with minorities who would be sympathetic to illegal immigrants. They drummed up minority witnesses who accused me of using racial epithets against them ? without a shred of proof!</p>
<p>Their strategy worked. I was convicted and sentenced to ten years in prison ? for apprehending a drug dealer!</p>
<p>For over two years my son has been without his mother. I think about Adam every minute. It is an unimaginable pain ? maybe something only a mother can feel. I?m not there to crawl in bed with him in the middle of the night when he has a bad dream. I?m not there to wrap my arms around him when he falls down. I feel so small, helpless? and alone.</p>
<p>But there is one ray of hope that I am clinging to with all my heart and soul: The Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund (LELDF).</p>
<p>If you?ve heard of LELDF then you know it?s the best friend a police officer could ever have. LELDF helps defend good officers who have been unfairly prosecuted for their split-second decisions in the line of duty. They?ve helped Officer Chuck Schwarz, in New York; Officer Scott Smith, in Connecticut; and Officer Wyatt Henderson, in Florida. And it was LELDF who helped Stacey Koon when the Rodney King-sympathizers tried to throw him in jail back in 1991.</p>
<p>Now, with your help, the LELDF will be doing what they can to help me.</p>
<p>It will be an uphill battle. The appeal alone has cost upwards of $35,000. And there are legal fees for expert witnesses, legal research, and other court fees. To make things worse, I was forced to resign after my conviction, and now in prison I have no means of earning money to fund my case.</p>
<p>I have already missed over two years of my little boy?s life. I missed his fourth and fifth birthdays. And I can?t bear to think how many more precious moments I will miss ? moments that every mother treasures but that I will never see!</p>
<p>That?s why I am going to swallow my pride and ask you the hardest question I?ve ever asked another person: Will you help me get home to Adam by sending a tax-deductible contribution to the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund to help them fund my appeal?</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice has unlimited federal tax dollars to spend on their case against me. But I must rely on the generous hearts of people like you to help clear my innocent name and send me home to my son!</p>
<p>Any gift you can send ? be it $20, $35, $50, $100, $500 ? is tax-deductible. By clicking here, your tax-deductible contribution will help fund my appeal as well as help other good officers who are being unfairly attacked.</p>
<p>This is my last chance to gain freedom. For me, your $20 gift could be the difference between clearing my name and being there for my dear son ? or spending the next eight years in prison, innocent, while Adam grows up without a mother. He will be a young man by then? almost 14. And I will have missed the years when a little boy needs his mommy the most.</p>
<p>Thank you so very much for taking the time to read my letter. Just knowing you?ve done that much gives me hope ? hope that I will get home to Adam before it?s too late. With your help, Adam will never spend another Christmas without his mom by his side.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>Stephanie Mohr</p>
<p>P.S. If I can be sent to prison for doing my job, then sooner or later every police officer in this nation will be at risk. By clicking here and contributing, you can help LELDF defend those good officers. Won?t you please help me clear my name and get home to my son by supporting LELDF today? I truly appreciate any help you can spare. From the bottom of my heart, thank you!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Origins: &amp;#160; The above-quoted appeal is a fundraising letter sent out by the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund (LELDF), an organization that describes its mission as providing ?assistance to law enforcement officers when it is necessary for them to defend actions taken in the line of duty to enforce the law.? The <a href="http://www.leldf.org/" type="external">LELDF</a> finances its programs through contributions from individuals. According to a 2004 report in The Daily Record, the LELDF?s ?most recent filing with the state shows the fund spent about 18 cents for each dollar collected to defend police officers ? up from 7.5 cents in</p>
<p>2000.?</p>
<p>The fundraising letter appears to have begun circulating in e-mail in January 2006, but USPS-delivered appeals describing the case of Officer Mohr and soliciting funds for the LELDF have been arriving in people?s regular mail at least since 2002.</p>
<p>A policewoman such as the one described in the appeal is indeed serving a prison sentence for a civil rights violation. However, the devil is in the details, so readers will have to make up their own minds as to whether her conviction and subsequent incarceration were merited or unjust.</p>
<p>On 21 September 1995, Cpl. Stephanie Mohr sent her police dog after a suspect named Ricardo Mendez, resulting in Mendez?s being severely bitten, the dog tearing out part of his lower leg. One of the officers with Cpl. Mohr reportedly beat the other suspect, Jorge Herrera-Cruz. Mendez was subsequently deported (he had been in the U.S. illegally), and Herrera-Cruz returned to El Salvador. In August 2001, Mohr was sentenced to ten years in prison for unlawfully releasing the canine on Mendez, and she is currently serving her sentence in a federal prison in West Virginia.</p>
<p>Her conviction is controversial. While fundraising efforts in her name present the matter as one of an exemplary officer unjustly accused, tried, and convicted, news articles about this case and other dog attack incidents involving Mohr paint a very different picture.</p>
<p>Although the letter quoted above describes the two suspects overpowered by Mohr and other officers as ?dangerous drug dealers,? every news story we sifted through referred to the pair as burglary suspects or homeless men. (Indeed, there was some belief that burglary charges were cooked up against these men only after they had been injured at the hands of police. Those conspiracy charges were not proved in court, however.) Supporting the supposition that Herrera-Cruz and Mendez were homeless men making a temporary abode on a roof (rather than burglars who scrambled atop a building for the purpose of finding a way to break into it) is an account from The Washington Times that noted: ?When apprehended, the two men said they were homeless and were only sleeping on the roof. Police searched the roof and found sleeping gear, a box for toothpaste, a package of deodorant and clam shells.?</p>
<p>What is not disputed in news accounts is that both men were down off the roof and had their hands pressed against the wall when a police dog was set on them. However, even if we accept Mohr?s account of the event (?Mendez made a move as if to flee the scene. In accordance with my training, I released my dog?), her unleashing the dog is still problematic, because in her testimony in U.S. District Court, Mohr admitted under cross-examination that police guidelines call for using force (including police dogs) only for self-defense or to protect others.</p>
<p>The canine attack on Mendez was not the only instance involving charges of Officer Mohr?s unlawfully turning her dog on suspects. She has had four civil lawsuits brought against her by others similarly treated. Three of those lawsuits were settled out of court (with county attorneys agreeing to pay settlements to the injured), and one went to trial, with Mohr being found not liable. According to the suits filed by each of those men:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>At her first trial, Mohr was acquitted of conspiracy charges laid against her, but the jury deadlocked on a deprivation of rights charge. At her second trial, evidence of similar acts she committed while handling a dog was admitted, and she was convicted on the latter charge.</p>

<article id="0000845" published-at="1998-04-28" title="PAGE ONE -- 3 Governor Candidates Show Their Tax Returns"><p>1998-04-28 04:00:00 PDT Los Angeles -- The three Democratic candidates for governor opened their tax returns for inspection yesterday, but some candidates were more open than others.</p>
<p>In a day of complicated political maneuvering, campaigns for <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Al+Checchi%22" type="external">Al Checchi</a>, <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Jane+Harman%22" type="external">Jane Harman</a> and <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Gray+Davis%22" type="external">Gray Davis</a> attempted to appear open about their personal finances. No copies were permitted, and reporters could take away only whatever information they could write down.</p>
<p>"It's full disclosure on our terms," one of the campaign consultants said.</p>
<p>The jousting began after Checchi on Friday released a summary of taxes for 1995 and 1996 taxes and invited reporters to Los Angeles to see more. But when a reporter showed up at his headquarters yesterday, Checchi provided few additional details.</p>
<p><a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Garry+South%22" type="external">Garry South</a>, manager of the Davis campaign, blasted Checchi's limited approach, saying he "owes it to voters to cough up his tax returns, back through the amount of time he got wealthy."</p>
<p>Checchi's campaign manager, Darry Sragow, defended the limited disclosure.</p>
<p>"It gives a very complete picture of the Checchis' finances," he said.</p>
<p>"He is just now entering public life. Going back to '95 gives you a complete picture."</p>
<p>As one of America's wealthiest men, Checchi had an adjusted gross income of $5.4 million for 1996; for the previous year it was $3.2 million.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Governor Davis, least wealthy of the three, divulged a decade of tax information that showed that he and his wife, Sharon, basically live on their two salaries. Last year, their adjusted gross income was $141,492.</p>
<p><a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Representative+Harman%22" type="external">Representative Harman</a>, whose husband, Sidney, is a wealthy electronics executive, made available their complete returns from 1993, her first year in Congress. Last year, the Harmans' adjusted gross income was close to $6 million.</p>
<p>Checchi made his fortune when he and a small group of partners purchased Northwest Airlines in 1989. Checchi now owns 11.4 million shares of the Minnesota-based airline.</p>
<p>The returns showed Checchi paid $1.3 million in federal taxes in 1996, after claiming deductions of $499,437. The only deductions, which include state and local taxes, interest payments on home mortgages, released by the campaign showed Checchi and his wife, Kathyrn, gave about half a million to charity.</p>
<p>The previous year, the Checchis' income was $3.2 million, with deductions of $560,938. Of that,$246,320 was given to charities.</p>
<p>Sragow said Checchi's taxes for 1997 were not complete because he had not received income information from four business partnerships. He said Checchi, who has filed an extension with the <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Internal+Revenue+Service%22" type="external">Internal Revenue Service</a>, has paid $1.5 million in federal taxes, and $453,000 in state taxes, and given $530,000 to charities.</p>
<p>Harman, who also sought an extension for 1997, last year paid $1.3 million in federal income taxes, and $319,000 to the state, on income of $3.4 million. Her Form 1040 is all but complete, her accountant said.</p>
<p>In 1996, the returns showed that <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Sidney+Harman%22" type="external">Sidney Harman</a> sold or donated shares of his firm, <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22Harman+International%22" type="external">Harman International</a>, worth $17.8 million to two charitable trusts established by his family.</p>
<p>In doing so, he pushed their income to nearly $63 million. He claimed $44 million in deductions, however, largely for the gift of the stock to the foundations. He paid $12.6 million in federal taxes and $4.3 million to the state.</p>
<p>The returns showed the Harmans also made tax and social security payments for domestic help. The couple has two school- age children in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Davis and his wife, who have no children to claim as deductions, paid $25,138 in federal taxes last year, and $7,873 to the state. They donated $8,000 to charities.</p>
<p>Davis and his wife, prominent in Democratic politics in California for many years, each gave $5 to the <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;amp;channel=politics&amp;amp;inlineLink=1&amp;amp;searchindex=solr&amp;amp;query=%22California+Democratic+Party%22" type="external">California Democratic Party</a> during the years such a checkoff was available.

<article id="0000861" published-at="2017-09-27" title="Donald Trump?s Dumb Border Wall Has Begun Construction In San Diego, California"><p>It?s begun. Customs and Border Protection <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/border-baja-california/sd-me-border-begins-20170926-story.html" type="external">started building</a> eight prototypes of Trump?s border wall in San Diego. The prototypes will be as much as 30 feet high and 30 feet long. Four of them will be made of concrete, and the other four with ?other materials.?</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>California Attorney General Xavier Becerra is suing to stop the construction because it violates environmental laws. However, a 2005 law allows Homeland Security to waive laws for border barriers, including ones set by the National Environmental Policy Act, Clean Air Act, and Endangered Species Act. Becerra argues that the law has expired.</p>
<p>On top of the lawsuits, there are also <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-trump-wall-20170926-story.html" type="external">fears</a>that there could be protests as big or bigger than the Dakota Access Pipeline protest last year. To prepare for this, concrete barriers and chain-link fences have been erected across the building area. Work is also underway to create ?free speech zones? to accommodate protesters.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Announcing construction, Ronald Vitiello, CBP?s acting deputy commissioner, said in a statement:</p>
<p>?We are committed to securing our border and that includes constructing border walls.</p>
<p>?Our multi-pronged strategy to ensure the safety and security of the American people includes barriers, infrastructure, technology and people.</p>
<p>?Moving forward with the prototypes enables us to continue to incorporate all the tools necessary to secure our border.?</p>
<p>Millions of Americans don?t support Trump?s $1.6 Billion vanity wall. A few fences and special zones probably won?t hold back the coming protests.</p>

<article id="0000866" published-at="2006-12-10" title="Meet the male pill"><p>This news is a few weeks old (I?ve been uncharacteristically busy lately), but for those of you who missed it, listen up. Researchers have stumbled on the fact that drugs used to treat hypertension and schizophrenia have the potential to become a male contraceptive pill.</p>
<p>It may actually be on the market some time in the next five years. Other than its capacity to alter the course of human history, reduce world poverty, and save the biodiversity of the planet, this really isn?t a big deal.</p>
<p>According this <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15937201" type="external">source</a>:</p>
<p>The pill, a single dose taken a few hours before having sex, affects contraction of the muscles that control ejaculation, but wouldn?t interfere with performance or orgasm sensation, researchers at King?s College London say. The result is a dry ejaculation.</p>
<p>No, I don?t know what a dry ejaculation is, and I?m not sure I want to. If you click on the video at this site you will be forced to sit through an ad before being treated to a clip of Woody Allen running around in a sperm suit.</p>
<p>I am not in the habit of getting my news from the Christian Broadcasting Network, but they have a really interesting <a href="http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/63990.aspx" type="external">video clip</a> on this subject as well. Is it just me, or does the announcer have an insane look in his eyes? Later in the clip you will also get to witness a professor?s brain shut down when a TV camera is pointed at it, and another guy who looks like Jim Carrey?s clone. I also found it interesting that an anti-abortion video followed on the heels of this one.</p>
<p>I wonder if the folks who run the Christian Broadcasting Network would support such a pill, considering that it has the potential to greatly reduce the 40 or so million abortions performed annually worldwide. On the other hand, it would tend to contradict their abstinence-only stance.</p>
<p>Why would this pill be a history-altering piece of technology? Fertility rates are already falling all over the planet. Conservatives have been writing books on the coming <a href="/article/the-36000-baby-rebate" type="external">birth dearth</a> for years and many governments (France, Italy, and Russia) are trying to bribe their women to have more babies.</p>
<p>The problem is that the fertility rates (number of births per woman) in some of the most poverty stricken areas of the world are still ballistic (Nigeria 7.8, Afghanistan 7.4, Uganda 7.1, Guinea 7.1, Congo 6.7). Although it is possible to reduce poverty with such high fertility rates, it is unlikely.</p>
<p>Note that many of these places also harbor much of the planet?s biodiversity. Birth rates are one of the reasons it has proven so difficult to light off strong economies, which would in turn help reduce growth rates (poverty reduction and low fertility rates beget each other). A critical mass can?t be attained unless a way can be found to help these people get a grip on fertility rates. Contraception simply does not exist in these rural places.</p>
<p>Impoverished people have no option but to convert biodiversity into food. Rich people have lots of other options. There is simply no reason not to try to reduce world poverty. It is one of those win-win situations.</p>
<p>One big concern related to such a pill would be sexually transmitted diseases. Would this pill increase the number of sex acts? Would a dry ejaculation (whatever the hell that is) reduce the risk of transmission?</p>
<p>Then come the usual questions about what motivates men. Would they forget to take it? Would they lie about having taken it? Would they want to take it? My opinion is that they would. In general (statistically speaking) guys want booty, not babies, and if they think that by taking the pill they will increase the chance of getting that, they will take it, in droves.</p>
<p>And finally, there is the question of endless economic growth tied to endless population growth. I?ve touched on this before. Intelligent, controlled immigration depopulates one country, maintains population in another, and fuels poverty reduction in both countries. There are billions of deeply impoverished people in the world ready to rise on up.</p>
<p>A reduction in world population is coming some day. It is something the world needs and it should not be feared. We should start warming up to the idea and maybe even look for ways to inch the day forward. It won?t be uncontroversial, human nature being what it is. Let the poor immigrate too and help maintain strong economies while allowing nature to heal the rural lands left behind.</p>
<p>I wrote about this a few years ago. You can go <a href="https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2006/12/darts1.pdf" type="external">here</a> to see my thoughts about it back then (chapter 10 in Volume I ? fiction). It is also OK to pinch a copy of the PDF for future reference. Just don?t try to sell it to anyone (I own the copyright).</p></article>

<article id="0000874" title=""><p>David Shuster, former reporter for Fox News and MSNBC, spoke candidly about his days as a Fox News reporter, compared Fox to MSNBC and revealed an instance where Bret Baier refused to report a story that debunked a Republican talking point. (H/T Eric J.)</p>
<p>Shuster discussed his time at Fox News from 1996-2002 when he worked as a correspondent based in Washington, D.C. He told host David Pakman that Fox was a ?very different organization back then? and that he ?never really had any issue? with bias until the Florida Recount in 2000.</p>
<p>Prior to that, he had issues with hosts using ?carefully crafted information? that he had gathered and ?tak(ing) it out of context &amp;#160;and us(ing) it for their own agenda.? He also said he had felt pressure to do negative stories about John McCain during the 2000 primaries, more so than he thought had been applied to the reporter covering George W. Bush. But while the opinion hosts would take bits from the Fox News memos (immortalized in Outfoxed) and ?weave them? into their commentary, Shuster said he never felt a ?heavy hand? until the Florida Recount in 2000.</p>
<p>Interestingly, he didn?t reveal much about what that heavy hand did - other than to suggest that there had been pressure to report on supposedly disenfranchised Republican voters in the Florida panhandle. According to Shuster, when then-reporter Bret Baier went to the panhandle and couldn?t find any, he declined to report that information and rock the boat. Shuster said he thought then that Baier would go far ?playing to management? but not to journalism.</p>
<p>Reporters at Fox ?will report on certain stories and they will not touch other stories... Sometimes the absence of covering stories? that?s where the bias can show up,? Shuster said.</p>
<p>Shuster acknowledge the leftward bias at MSNBC but, he said, it?s ?much more of a fact-based approach? than at Fox.</p>
<p>As for Fox?s sinking ratings, he thinks the ?credibility gap? is finally catching up with them. Their ?credibility simply doesn?t exist any more.? Shuster said Fox is seen as ?a Republican house organ, as GOP propaganda.? Even some moderates and conservatives ?felt they got burned? in the last election with Fox?s predictions for a Romney victory. ?I think more and more Americans feel that what they?re getting from Fox News simply is not accurate and cannot be trusted.?</p>

<article id="0000880" published-at="2015-07-28" title="The Brief: July 28, 2015"><p>The legislative committee investigating Planned Parenthood fetal tissue donations is examining a video that a regional affiliate says might have been filmed in one of its Houston clinics.</p>
<p>The committee, chaired by state Sen. Charles Schwertner, R-Georgetown, is set to hold a hearing Wednesday following two already released videos that show Planned Parenthood executives elsewhere in the country discussing the topic. But lawmakers are also reviewing a video obtained by Attorney General Ken Paxton, which Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast says could be from a Houston clinic, <a href="" type="internal">the Tribune's Alexa Ura reports</a>:</p>
<p>The AG's office granted lawmakers and their staff access to the video under&amp;#160;the&amp;#160; <a href="" type="internal">legislative privilege provided to members of the Legislature</a>&amp;#160;by open government laws, said Thomas Holloway, a Schwertner spokesman.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Legislative privilege allows state agencies to provide confidential information to lawmakers who request it "for legislative purposes."&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p>
<p>The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. <a href="" type="internal">Become one</a>.</p>
<p>Bracing for a secretly recorded video to be released, an attorney for Planned Parenthood sent a letter to Schwertner's office on Sunday saying the organization believed that the committee chairman had access to a video recorded by the Center for Medical Progress at a Houston clinic. The organization asked to view the video out of "fairness" ahead of Wednesday's committee hearing.</p>
<p>On Monday, [Planned&amp;#160;Parenthood Gulf Coast spokeswoman Rochelle]&amp;#160;Tafolla said Schwertner's office referred their request to the attorney general's office. Planned Parenthood then sent a letter to the AG's office requesting to view the video, saying that "because the videotape has already been reviewed by such Members and staff, it is no longer privileged."</p>
<p>Paxton's office wouldn't elaborate on how it obtained the video and what it includes, saying Paxton's testimony on Wednesday should help clarify both points.&amp;#160;The group behind the two other videos, the&amp;#160;Center for Medical Progress, visited a Planned Parenthood Houston clinic in April, <a href="" type="internal">we reported earlier Monday</a>. That group hasn't responded to multiple requests for comment.</p>
<p>And in other Planned Parenthood news this week, the national organization has <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/planned-parenthood-website-hacked-anti-abortion-activists-120664.html" type="external">asked the FBI</a> to look into its website's hacking on Sunday.</p>

<article id="0000885" title="Sanctuary City Releases Dangerous Illegal From Jail. Trump Hears About It, Takes Swift Action"><p>As a way to protest President Trump?s anti-immigration stance, cities around the country have vowed to protect immigrants from unjust deportation and unfair treatment. New York City is one of these ?Sanctuary Cities?.</p>
<p>But when repeat felon and previously deported Dominican national, Hector Suarez, was released from an NYC jail, the city refused to honor an active detainer filed by Trump?s Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.</p>
<p>44-year-old Suarez was released on bail back on December 30th while President Obama was still in office. This was one day after ICE filed a detainer with Manhattan Central Booking.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Sanctuary City allowed Suarez to leave on bail and return to his life in America. The ICE under Trump?s administration aims to put a stop to this?</p>
<p>Because Trump build his campaign on deporting immigrants and denying access to people from certain countries, ICE does not look kindly on cities like New York, Houston, Dallas, and Salt Lake City, because they are making it more difficult for them to do their job.</p>
<p>After Suarez was released on bail, ICE agents hunted him down and arrested him on a federal warrant recently. Now he is under custody of the U.S. Martial Service.</p>
<p>On Monday, ICE revealed the details of Suarez?s criminal history during a press release.</p>
<p>?Suarez, a citizen and national of the Dominican Republic, was ordered removed in October 2002 and was subsequently removed from the United States to the Dominican Republic on Nov. 7, 2002. In March 2003, Suarez was encountered in Texas and was served with a Notice of Intent /Decision to Reinstate Prior Order. He was criminally charged and pleaded guilty to the violation of Title 8 United States Code 1326(a) and (b)(2) in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. In April 2004, Suarez was removed to the Dominican Republic for a second time. In August 2006, Suarez was again encountered in the United States, but this time in New York, where he was served with a Notice of Intent /Decision to Reinstate Prior Order. On Sept. 16, 2009, he was removed to the Dominican Republic for a third time.</p>
<p>?Although his most recent charge is a misdemeanor, Suarez has a more serious criminal history dating back to 1997. In January 1997, he was convicted of attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree in violation of New York State Penal Law (NYSPL) section 220.16. April 2002, he was convicted for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree in violation of NYSPL section 220.06.&amp;#160; In November 2006, he was convicted for Attempted Assault in the Second Degree in violation of NYSPL section 120.05(03).&amp;#160; In September 2008, Suarez was convicted in the United States District Court, Southern District of Texas for violation of Supervised Release and sentenced to incarceration to run consecutively to his New York State sentence.?</p>
<p>Thomas R. Decker, ICE?s New York field office director for Enforcement and Removal Operations, wrote a heated statement about why he considers people like Suarez a threat to America.</p>
<p>?This is the case of another criminal alien, a felon, who was released back into the streets. Politics and rhetoric are not what keep the people of this great city safe.</p>
<p>?ICE is committed to maintaining and strengthening its relationship with local law enforcement. We also welcome changes to the city?s present detainer policies in the interest of public safety and national security.?</p>
<p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to put an end to sanctuary cities and to step up immigration enforcement. The cities have refused to honor it.</p>
<p>What do you think about ICE and immigration policy?</p>

<article id="0000887" published-at="2005-07-07" title="Explosions in London linked to G8"><p>A <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0,12780,1523169,00.html" type="external">series of explosions</a> during rush hour this morning in Central London at underground tube stations and on double-decker buses has claimed the lives of several commuters and injured more than 100. The city?s transport system is now completely shut down as rescue teams and investigators clear the scene.</p>
<p>Although it?s not yet known who is responsible for the explosions, British Prime Minister Tony Blair <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/07/international/europe/07cnd-explosion.html?hp" type="external">has called the incident a terrorist attack</a> and <a href="http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/Page7853.asp" type="external">suggested</a> it was aimed at disrupting the G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, this week.</p>
<p>?It is particularly barbaric that this has happened on a day when people are meeting to try to help the problems of poverty in Africa, and the long term problems of climate change and the environment,? Blair said. ?Just as it is reasonably clear that this is a terrorist attack, or a series of terrorist attacks, it is also reasonably clear that it is designed and aimed to coincide with the opening of the G8.?</p>
<p>Blair has returned to London to deal with the incident, but said in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/07/07/blair.statement/" type="external">a statement</a> from Gleneagles at 1 p.m. BST: ?We will not allow violence to change our societies or our values nor will we allow it to stop the work of this summit.

<article id="0000890" published-at="2010-04-13" title="The Crisis"><p><a href="" type="internal"></a>Inspired by Thomas Paine</p>
<p>?These are the times that try men?s souls.&amp;#160; The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ushistory.org/PAINE/" type="external">Thomas Paine</a> eloquently chose those words 233 years ago to call out for a surge of Patriots to stand up and fight tyranny as the evil that it is despite the fragile state of the American Revolution.&amp;#160; Today, America finds itself in a much similar situation.&amp;#160; We may not be defending our homesteads by arms from pillaging British soldiers, but we are without question defending our liberty against an increasingly oppressive federal government that our <a href="http://www.foundingfathers.info/" type="external">Founding Fathers</a> would have found intolerable.&amp;#160; It is in this time where we can choose to forsake our God given rights to Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness or We The People can take a stand now, united not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans, and say ?Give Me Liberty!?</p>
<p>The crisis America faces now is unlike anything she has before experienced.&amp;#160; Through decades of corruption, <a href="http://www.heritage.org/budgetchartbook/federal-spending-per-household" type="external">out of control spending</a> and one unconstitutional overstep after another the federal government has grown into a cancer that is eating away at the heart of our country and threatening our liberty.&amp;#160; It has boiled to the point where we must take drastic, immediate action or else watch our country crumble before our eyes.&amp;#160; We must not be so naive that we are somehow invincible from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law" type="external">natural law</a>.&amp;#160; We cannot blindly press forward like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Smith" type="external">Edward Smith</a> only to suddenly realize that yes, the Titanic can sink.&amp;#160; We are not invincible, but we are Americans and Americans rise up and fight for their country when it is in a crisis!</p>
<p>The most threatening problems America faces are internal and they are obvious:&amp;#160; a national debt over <a href="http://www.usdebtclock.org/" type="external">$12.7 trillion</a>, entitlement spending combined with interest on the debt taking up more than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_States_federal_budget#Total_spending" type="external">70% of the federal budget</a>, and unconstitutional federal takeovers of the mortgage industry, countless banks, GM, Chrysler and AIG. &amp;#160;Of course we cannot forget the recent sweeping <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-31376-Raleigh-Holistic-Health-Examiner%7Ey2010m3d22-Health-Care-Reform-Passed" type="external">$940 billion health care reform bill</a> that passed which also nationalizes the <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/mar/29/student-loan-takeover-slips-through-with-health-ca/" type="external">student loan industry</a>.&amp;#160; Do we dare still call ourselves a capitalist country?&amp;#160; Is the comfort of ignorance and complacency worth the sacrifice of liberty?</p>
<p>This must end immediately!&amp;#160; The only way to do that is to eliminate the very sources of money that feeds this cancer.&amp;#160; Debating on whether this program can stay or that program should be trimmed a little is utter nonsense.&amp;#160; Every day that we allow this to continue only prolongs the inevitable, painful recovery that is necessary to ensure the survival of our country and even worse, it encourages this out-of-control behavior to continue. &amp;#160;The course we are on is absolutely not sustainable.&amp;#160; What works in your own house works in the White House.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; If you are in massive debt you cannot take out even bigger loans, triple your spending, while demanding your boss pay you more money so you can finance the bills.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; You would end up on the street begging for money.&amp;#160; If America does not end this madness now we will be forced to declare bankruptcy and beg China and Japan for a bailout.</p>
<p>So just cut everything?&amp;#160; YES, Social security, Medicare, Medicade, SCHIP, unemployment, every department budget and everything else that is not essential to national security (although many changes are needed there too).&amp;#160; If individual states want to continue socialist entitlement programs within their state?s constitutional authority that is fine, but the federal government must eliminate them.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Some programs can be eliminated quickly while some programs will need to be phased out over several years.&amp;#160; Understandably those Americans nearing retirement who have paid into a system like Social Security all of their lives deserve their earned benefits.&amp;#160; However, at some point a line must be drawn.&amp;#160; Are we as a country going to settle with the greatest generation being behind us or will we step up and do what needs to be done in order to get back on the road to prosperity and ensure that our children enjoy a better America than we did?</p>
<p>Cutting federal spending alone will not fix the problem.&amp;#160; Taxes and government regulation still must be addressed to allow the free market economy to get back on its feet and run.&amp;#160; Regarding the federal income tax, I am personally in favor of abolishing it and going back to an <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/education/fact-sheets/taxes/ustax.shtml" type="external">excise tax system</a> that sustained America until 1913 when the radical progressive President <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/woodrowwilson" type="external">Woodrow Wilson</a> had <a href="http://www.northjersey.com/community/history/89892957_Life_before_the_federal_income_tax.html" type="external">better ideas</a>.&amp;#160; In doing that the IRS would be eliminated thus dramatically reducing the federal bullying power over the Americans.&amp;#160; However, a simpler solution that can be done now is an across-the-board <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_tax" type="external">flat tax</a> of 10% for both personal and corporate income tax.&amp;#160; Then set capital gains at 5%.&amp;#160; What about regulation?&amp;#160; There is way too much red tape strung across the country for me to itemize.&amp;#160; However, a great start is eliminating federal mandates on minimum wage and overtime pay so the free market can allocate wages appropriately saving businesses billions of dollars that they can use better elsewhere.</p>
<p>You are probably thinking ?No, this is way too radical.?&amp;#160; You bet it is, but only in context to where we are now.&amp;#160; Remember, one of the major tipping points leading to the American Revolution was over taxes.&amp;#160; The infamous Boston Tea Party was in response to the <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/us/9f.asp" type="external">Tea Act of 1773</a>, which enraged American colonists so much that <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/Declaration/signers/adams_s.htm" type="external">Sam Adams</a> and the Sons of Liberty stormed a British cargo ship in the darkness of the night and threw crates of tea in the Boston harbor.&amp;#160; I am not advocating riots, but if a simple tax on tea caused such uproar to motivate a revolution why are we so comfortable with an <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2010/03/26/tax-writers-cant-figure-out-the-tax-code-either/" type="external">IRS tax code over 70,000 pages</a> in length?</p>
<p>Seriously, think about this.&amp;#160; How much better would your life be if you kept 70% more of the money you earned?&amp;#160; Would you be better able to pursue happiness for yourself, your family, and the charity of your choice? &amp;#160;What do you think the economy would be like if businesses weren?t forced to pay taxes on their employees or wages above what the market says that particular job is worth?&amp;#160; Do you think perhaps that businesses would be able expand and create more jobs, invest in research and development, reduce product prices, and increase wages and benefits for skilled and valued employees?&amp;#160; Would billions or even trillions of dollars from all over the world flood from their overtaxed countries to the United States for opportunity?&amp;#160; Overall, do you think those changes would get American back on the track that allowed us to go from 13 rugged colonies to the greatest country the world has ever witnessed?&amp;#160; The answer is a resounding yes!</p>
<p>I am not attempting to minimize other pressing issues that need attention nor will I tell you that by doing everything I suggested that life in America will instantly be sunshine and lollipops.&amp;#160; The problems we are facing now have been building over 100 years and they will take time to fix, but this is a giant leap on the road to recovery.</p>
<p>This war against a power hungry federal government is not going to be easy, as we have witnessed recently with the health care bill.&amp;#160; Governments are by nature self-protecting against any limitations or obstructions.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Politicians are masters at using smoke &amp;amp; mirrors and rhetoric to keep us fighting over single issues instead of the real problem ? the government itself.&amp;#160; But We The People, through education and action, can and will prevail if we realize that our government is a government ? <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/abrahamlincoln" type="external">of the people, for the people, by the people.</a>? It is a necessary evil, given certain limited powers with its primary purpose to protect our liberty.</p>
<p>So here we are again, to answer the fundamental question.&amp;#160; Will we forsake our God given rights to Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness and allow the federal government to do as it wishes with our lives and property?&amp;#160; I pray not.&amp;#160; Instead, as an American, I strongly pray we choose liberty and freedom over tyranny and slavery.</p>
<p>There is one final thought I must say.&amp;#160; Do not fear!&amp;#160; The cause for concern is great, but we must remember that we are Americans.&amp;#160; We have beaten back tyranny from foreign and domestic enemies for 233 years and we will do it again this time, but in order to do so we must be united.&amp;#160; Therefore, to echo the author of <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/paine/commonsense/" type="external">Common Sense</a> once again:</p>
<p>?I call not upon a few, but upon all: not this state or that state, but on every state: up and help us?better have too much force than too little, when so great an object is at stake.&amp;#160; Let it be told to the future world, that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet and repulse it.&amp;#160; Say not that thousands are gone, turn out your tens of thousands?It matters not where you live, or what rank of life you hold, the evil or the blessing will reach you all.&amp;#160; The far and the near?the rich and the poor, will suffer or rejoice alike.?</p></article>
<article id="0000891" published-at="2015-04-07" title="Trade Bait Legend: Brooklyn Dodgers outfielder Cal Abrams was ordered to publicly berate the Cincinnati Reds' manager, then was traded to that team a few days later."><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Claim: &amp;#160; Brooklyn Dodgers outfielder Cal Abrams was publicly ordered to berate the Cincinnati Reds? manager, then was traded to that team a few days later.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Origins: &amp;#160; Cal Abrams, a major league outfielder in the 1950s who started out with the Brooklyn Dodgers, travelled the same career arc as many an unfortunate baseball player of his era: a fine talent signed to a team with too many established stars</p>
<p></p>
<p>for him to be able to crack the starting lineup, he found himself relegated to pinch-hitting and occasional starting or fill-in appearances year after year, bound to his team in perpetuity by the reserve clause that provided players with no leverage to demand trades or declare free agency. His legacy among Dodgers fans is that he?s remembered primarily as the player who was thrown out trying to score the winning run in the bottom of the ninth inning of the last game of the 1950 season, a contest Brooklyn had to win in order to force a playoff for the pennant. (They didn?t.)</p>
<p>As Abrams described his situation three decades later, the Dodgers brass always seemed to have a handy excuse not giving him playing time:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>And in 1952 they didn?t play me at all. [Dressen] said I wasn?t hitting. They told me they were looking to build a young ballclub, and I was twenty-eight, and yet they went and got Andy Pafko for left field, and he was [three years] older than I was!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even worse for Cal Abrams, his manager?s apparent dislike for him meant that even when he did get into games, he was called upon infrequently and often under difficult circumstances:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As Roger Kahn, a sportswriter who covered the Brooklyn Dodgers for the New York Herald Tribune in 1952-53 noted, Brooklyn manager Chuck Dressen ?didn?t care for Cal Abrams? and ?was capable of cruelty,? a characterization borne out by another incident recalled by Abrams:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>But the coup de grace, the anecdote that inspired this page, was a delicious tale of mean-spirited revenge recounted by Roger Kahn in his 1993 book about baseball in New York, The Era: 1947-1957, which had Dressen deliberately setting Abrams on a rival team?s manager, knowing full well that a deal had already been completed to send Abrams to the team whose manager he had been tricked into loudly berating:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Dodgers broke nicely in 1952. By June 9, the team was in first place.</p>
<p>?The guy managing the Reds is Rogers Hornsby,? Dressen said.</p>
<p>?I know that,? Abrams said. ?I know who Rogers Hornsby is.?</p>
<p>?If you want to stay with my club, get on him,? Dressen said. ?Call him every goddamn name you can think of. I want you to get him so mad he can?t think straight.?</p>
<p>Abrams spent the first game of a double-header bellowing and screaming taunts at Hornsby.</p>
<p>The Dodgers won the first game, 6 to 1 . Hornsby was raging. In the clubhouse, Dressen said to Abrams, ?Don?t bother to dress here. You?ve been traded. You?re playing for the Cincinnati Reds. Abrams, your new manager is Rogers Hornsby.?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Considering that Rogers Hornsby was one of the most intensely disliked players and managers of his era, detested by both those who played with him and those who played for him, one has to wonder how Cal Abrams managed to survive the rest of the 1952 season.</p>
<p>But first we have to wonder, is this anecdote true or just another tall tale? Roger Kahn was there, covering the Dodgers day in and day out, when this event supposedly took place, and his version of the story includes such details as specific dates and game</p>
<p>scores. Still, we always try to check at least the basic facts before presenting anecdotes as true, and in this case the results were puzzling.</p>
<p>The Dodgers did begin a series against the Reds in Cincinnati on 6 June 1952, and Abrams was traded to Cincinnati on 8 June , a day on which the two teams played each other in a double-header (although the Dodgers won the first game 11-7, not 6-0 as claimed). But this story collides with reality when one notes that on the day Cal Abrams was traded, Rogers Hornbsy was managing the St. Louis Browns, not the Cincinnati Reds. Hornsby was fired by the Browns two days later, and he didn?t take over as skipper of the Reds until two months after Cal Abrams was traded to that club. Moreover, this discrepancy can?t be explained away as a case of confusion over dates (i.e., maybe Abrams had been yelling at Hornsby earlier in the year) because the Dodgers and the Browns were in different leagues and didn?t play each other at all, so Abrams never had an opportunity to berate Hornsby before they were united as members of the Cincinnati Reds.</p>
<p>The only way this anecdote makes sense as told is if Cal Abrams had been ordered to abuse not Rogers Hornsby but Luke Sewell, who was manager of the Cincinnati club the day Abrams was traded from the Dodgers to the Reds. But then this isn?t nearly as good a story, both because Sewell was far less irascible than Hornsby and because he resigned as manager of the Reds a month later (thereby saving Abrams from having to spend several years in baseball purgatory).</p>
<p>Perhaps this anecdote is just another of the national pastime?s tall tales, or perhaps it involved different teams and personnel whose identities have been obscured with the passage of time. As Ronald Reagan once said, ?Trust, but verify? ? to which we add: ?and be prepared for a little disappointment.?</p>

<article id="0000895" published-at="2017-12-28" title="The Top Ten Films of 2017"><p>As with any movie year, it is impossible to identify a single, overarching theme that unites the best films of 2017. In this year of immense political change, there were some films that resonated eerily with contemporary anxieties (Get Out), others that quite deliberately sought to evoke them (Steven Spielberg?s The Post), and many more still that offered an escape, happy or not. At the multiplex, escapism ruled the day; the year?s top ten grossers included the usual assortment of franchise tentpoles and superhero films, some (Wonder Woman) more worthy than others (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2). At the arthouse, the outlook was bleaker: both in the chilly subject matter so frequently on screen and the disappointing quality of much of the work itself. Celebrated auteurs like Terrence Malick and Michael Haneke were running on fumes with their latest films, and the big winner at Cannes, Ruben Ostlund?s The Square, was an empty exercise in sneering satire.</p>
<p>For all that, there was much to celebrate in 2017. And if there is indeed one nebulous quality common to all my favorites, it was a willingness to bridge sensibilities, scramble genres, or confound expectations. The Florida Project brought an unexpected warmth and joy to a story that might have called out for pure despair. With Faces Places, Agn?s Varda showed that the French New Wave is still alive and kicking, in a charming, cheerful odyssey across France that doubles as a meditation on art and aging. Darren Aronofsky implausibly brought the surreal fever dream that is Mother! to mainstream audiences, while Christopher Nolan and Edgar Wright stamped their idiosyncratic personal visions onto major blockbusters. And no film mixed genres more effectively or stirred more debate than my number-one pick?a wholly unanticipated and welcome February surprise.</p>
<p>10. Mother!</p>
<p>Darren Aronofsky?s Mother!, a cinematic curio that polarized critics, <a href="https://www.avclub.com/mother-earns-a-rare-semi-coveted-f-from-cinemascore-1818476876" type="external">appalled audiences</a>, and spectacularly flopped at the box office, already has the makings of a cult classic. It might be the strangest big studio release of the year: a set-bound psychological thriller, shot largely with handheld cameras in uncomfortably intimate close-ups, that places Hollywood?s current It Girl (Jennifer Lawrence) in a violent, often darkly funny Biblical and ecological allegory. Javier Bardem is the alternately forgiving and wrathful patriarch, Lawrence his long-suffering wife, and a strong supporting cast led by Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer embody the wretched masses of humanity.</p>
<p>Aronofsky is nothing if not ambitious: his film aims to make familiar religious parables strange by placing them in a radically different context, while folding an additional environmental allegory on top. He seems to be inspired by the open-ended metaphorical conceits of Luis Bu?uel?s films?think The Exterminating Angel, about a group of dinner guests who inexplicably cannot leave the table?and in its best moments, Mother! captures some of Bu?uel?s surreal, anarchic spirit. The movie is not entirely consistent, and the final scene tilts from the clever to the juvenile and irreverent. But the movie is a technical marvel throughout, admirably audacious in both concept and execution, and worthy of inclusion on those merits alone.</p>
<p></p>
<p>9. Baby Driver</p>
<p>It is rare enough these days to find an action blockbuster not derived from an existing franchise; rarer still to find one as purely entertaining and masterfully constructed as Baby Driver. That is not to say that Edgar Wright?s film is wholly original: ever the pastiche artist, Wright lovingly lifts material from movies like Heat and The Driver in this tale of a teenage getaway driver (Ansel Elgort) reluctantly enlisted by an Atlanta mob boss (Kevin Spacey) to run heist jobs with a ragtag group of ex-cons. The movie distinguishes itself through its unconventional mixing of genres, with moments of high comedy juxtaposed with shockingly non-cartoonish violence, and above all in its technique. The opening chase scene is already a classic: a wordless exercise in carefully calibrated tension, with every swerve, skid, and windshield wipe perfectly synced with the retro soundtrack.</p>
<p></p>
<p>8. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri</p>
<p>The latest film from Martin McDonagh?he of In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths fame?is another mordant, violent, witty black comedy, although this one arguably tips the scales fully toward drama. The premise is certainly no laughing matter: Frances McDormand stars as the angry mother of a rape and murder victim, who puts up three billboards on a lonely stretch of road castigating the local sheriff (Woody Harrelson) for failing to find her killer. When the movie begins, it seems set to be a righteous saga of revenge, but McDonagh keeps complicating it with unexpected nuance. McDormand?s character is no paragon of virtue, Harrelson?s sheriff is a good man beset by a fatal cancer diagnosis, and even his racist brute of an assistant (Sam Rockwell) earns a redemptive character arc. It is a tribute to McDonagh?s gifts as a screenwriter that he can both keep the audience guessing and paint his morality play in so many shades of grey.</p>
<p>The movie occasionally suffers from McDonagh?s writerly faults, too: he is sometimes too enamored of his own voice, putting verbose screeds in the mouths of characters ill suited for them. (An early scene with McDormand and the local priest is especially egregious.) And the movie?s brutal violence is dispensed so casually, even flippantly, that it sometimes verges on the grotesque. But in the end, all the bloodletting does serve a purpose. Far from being a Tarantinoesque revenge fantasy, Three Billboards ultimately argues for ending the cycle of violence to achieve a more lasting civic peace?though it leaves open the question of whether its characters will have the courage to do so.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7. The Lost City of Z</p>
<p>When people complain that ?they don?t make them like they used to,? they are probably thinking about a movie like The Lost City of Z: an old-fashioned and intelligent adventure on a grand canvas, made with flesh-and-blood characters and carrying real dramatic weight. A shame, then, that this excellent historical drama, about a British explorer?s search for a fanciful lost city in the Amazon, barely made a blip when it came out this spring.</p>
<p>The movie, based on a 2009 nonfiction bestseller, is the brainchild of writer-director James Gray, a critical darling whose work often recalls the best of 1970s New Hollywood. His latest plays like a cross between David Lean and Werner Herzog, offering both the straightforward thrills of a jungle adventure and the weightier merits of an art film about obsession and delusion. The central figure is Percy Fawcett (a surprisingly good Charlie Hunnam), a British officer whose fervent belief in a lost Amazonian city earns him the mockery of his colleagues and send him on repeated expeditions to prove them wrong. The film takes Fawcett?s quests seriously?he is a heroic figure, not just a foolhardy dreamer?but it also chronicles the toll of his obsession on his family, and on his own sense of judgment. The movie is a stately and somber thing, patient in its pacing but accumulating gravitas as Fawcett makes trip after trip into the heart of darkness. The film?s final passages have a foreboding, lyrical sense of unreality?and the very last shot is one of the most haunting of the year.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. Lady Bird</p>
<p>The most critically acclaimed film of the year is far from the most ambitious. Much of Lady Bird, Greta Gerwig?s directorial debut, covers well-trodden thematic territory: adolescent angst, teenage rebellion, sexual awakenings, and the perennial teenage fear of becoming one?s parents.&amp;#160;But Gerwig?s film is a cut above the usual. Movies like this live or die on the details, and Lady Bird gets just about every one right.</p>
<p>Saoirse Ronan plays the titular Lady Bird, n?e Christine, a spunky and sometimes insufferable senior at a Catholic girls? school in Sacramento, eager to flee her lower middle class upbringing and overbearing mother (Laurie Metcalf) for the cosmopolitan paradise of New York. The movie hits many of the usual beats for a coming-of-age dramedy?there is stress about college applications, a teenage romance or two, and a climactic scene at senior prom?but it does so with unusual sensitivity, wit, and a wise awareness of the ways that parents and children project their deepest hopes and fears onto each other. Though Lady Bird is the protagonist, the movie is really about her awakening to a world beyond her narrow wants and needs, her growing understanding of?and gratitude for?the friends and family she is at first so eager to leave behind.</p>
<p>In a movie filled with grace notes, two scenes stand out in particular. One is the moment when Sister Sarah Joan (Lois Smith), a nun at Christine?s school who was once the object of her mockery, offers her a gentle, generous life lesson on love and attention. The second comes on a car ride to prom, when Lady Bird embraces a decidedly unhip Dave Matthews song over the objections of the hipster poseurs around her. It?s the turning point of the movie, when Lady Bird learns to embrace her roots, no matter how middle-class or middlebrow they may be. Lady Bird embraces them, too, and it soars.</p>

<p>5. A Quiet Passion</p>
<p>Emily Dickinson?s life story is not one that lends itself naturally to biopic treatment. A semi-recluse whose poetry languished in obscurity during her own lifetime, Dickinson rarely strayed from the company of her close family and the comforts of their Amherst home. Seen from the outside, her life was almost entirely devoid of incident?which only makes Terrence Davies?s A Quiet Passion all the more remarkable an achievement.</p>
<p>Starring a commanding Cynthia Nixon in the lead role, A Quiet Passion offers a complex and contradictory portrait of its subject. The film?s early stretches are full of the zippy, witty dialogue one would expect from a literary period piece, establishing Emily as the kind of free-thinking heroine one might find in an Austen novel, while sketching her friendship with her sister Vinnie (Jennifer Ehle) and their neighbor Vryling (Catherine Bailey). But A Quiet Passion really distinguishes itself during its second, more somber half. As Dickinson withdraws ever more into herself, pushing away her sister and her suitors alike, she becomes a compelling, paradoxical figure: a woman who is steadfast in her convictions but insecure in her own image, free from society?s expectations but curiously repressed, able to see the world more clearly than those around her but unable to participate fully in its life. The movie is a stately study in how pride and independence can curdle into contempt. The young Emily who begins the film in an intellectual rebellion against her family?s Puritan mores ends trapped in an emotional prison of her own making, with poetry her only outlet.</p>
<p>The film is also an apt meeting of subject and artist. Davies, like Dickinson, is an uncompromising master who has gone under-recognized in his own day, and something of an aloof ascetic as well (he has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/19/terence-davies-religion-being-gay-sunset-song-interview" type="external">spoken frankly</a> about his struggles as a celibate gay Catholic, and is frequently attracted to emotional loners as subjects). He is also a filmmaker with the rare ability to convey inner emotional states through cinematic language. Two scenes stand out in particular: one, a haunting dreamlike interlude with an overhead perspective of a mystery man ascending to Emily?s chamber; the other, a languid pan across a candle-lit living room, where Emily?s friends and family are gathered in concert as she peers in solitude from the doorway.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Dunkirk</p>
<p>For all his critical and commercial success, Christopher Nolan has often been haunted by three familiar complaints: that his films are cold and clinical, with only the most perfunctory expressions of human emotion; that his plots are unnecessarily convoluted, enamored of intricate puzzle box structures; and that his action sequences are incoherent and uninspired.&amp;#160;Dunkirk answer Nolan?s detractors on all three counts, while staying true to the qualities that endeared him to viewers in the first place.</p>
<p>On the face of it, Dunkirk offers Nolan his most straightforward plot yet: a recreation of the Allied troops? pivotal evacuation from the beaches of Dunkirk in late May 1940. In a typical Nolan move, however, the director divides the film into three separate threads, depicting the evacuation by air, sea, and land and cutting between the three even though each is occurring over a different time frame. At first, this decision may seem a confusing contrivance, but it pays off: Nolan?s intercutting heightens the intensity of each section and provides one especially jarring moment of dislocation, which instantly causes the viewer to see one character?s actions in a new light.</p>
<p>It is true that Dunkirk?s characters are more chess pieces than fully developed human beings, but that is beside the point: there is no need for elaborate backstory in a film that is fundamentally about the primitive, urgent human need to survive. Nonetheless, the movie is a textbook example of how to develop character through action rather than dialogue. And there is one moment in particular, on the civilian ship captained by Mark Rylance?s character?when an adolescent makes a grown-up decision to lie so as to spare a soldier pain?that counts as one of the most touching human gestures in Nolan?s filmography.</p>
<p>Most importantly, when it comes to action&amp;#160;Dunkirk is by far Nolan?s most satisfying film, displaying a more confident command of craft than his memorable but sometimes sloppy Batman movies. Whatever else one may say about it, Dunkirk is quite simply a first-rate war movie: one that often matches the visceral impact of Saving Private Ryan but with only a fraction of the blood and guts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Faces Places</p>
<p>A portrait of the artist as an old lady, Faces Places finds octogenarian filmmaker Agn?s Varda, who first cut her teeth at the height of the French New Wave, crisscrossing the country with JR, a 30-something street artist. Together, the unlikely duo take their artistic talents on the road, creating a kind of traveling ethnography of contemporary France as they create larger-than-life portraits of the ordinary citizens they encounter.</p>
<p>Like much of Varda?s work, Faces Places is characterized by an airy, casual tone that disguises its quite serious concerns: aging, the transience of memory, and the shifting paradigms of working-class life chief among them. The film is both a rewarding exercise in artistic collaboration and a tribute to the individual artist at its core. If this is indeed Varda?s last film, it will be a fitting swan song. (See my <a href="" type="internal">full review here</a>).</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. The Florida Project</p>
<p>?Celebrate good times, come on!? blares the music over the opening credits of Sean Baker?s The Florida Project. This may seem a strange choice for a film about childhood poverty, single motherhood, and family breakdown in the Sunshine State, but it is a fitting initiation into a film that refuses to treat any of these subjects in a predictable way.</p>
<p>The Florida Project is set at the Magic Castle, one in a cluster of cheap motels on the outskirts of Disney World; it follows the day-to-day life of the impoverished families who make this land of strip malls and swamps their home. There is an obvious juxtaposition at the heart of the film?the fantasy paradise of Disney World existing side-by-side with the hardscrabble poverty next door?but Baker complicates it at every turn. The movie?s color palette is consistently sunny and vibrant, and its episodic early stretches suggest how the simple joys of childhood can be accessed no matter one?s upbringing. Baker brings a playful, childlike perspective to the scenes of the kids exploring their world, and he elicits an endearing and natural performance from the six year-old Brooklynn Prince.</p>
<p>Yet The Florida Project is not some starry-eyed ode to childhood innocence; it offers an unsparing (and often unpleasant) look at the broken social fabric in which its characters live. The movie is full of irresponsible adults making poor decisions and children who act out in obnoxious and destructive ways, seemingly doomed to repeat the cycle. What makes this all tolerable is the warm humanism that animates the entire film, embodied most visibly in the kind-hearted, over-worked but endlessly patient motel manager played by Willem Dafoe (cast against type in one of the best performances of his career). Squint just a little at the character, and you can see a surrogate for the director himself: a man who may be infuriated and exasperated by his subjects, but who extends them his love and empathy all the same.</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Get Out</p>
<p>The year?s best film and biggest surprise came early: rolling into theaters in February with little advance notice and leaving a trail of hype in its wake, Get Out instantly generated the kind of water-cooler debate that vanishingly few American studio releases can command. What was this film, anyway: a cringe comedy about racial anxieties, dressed up in the trappings of a horror film? A bizarre mashup of Guess Who?s Coming to Dinner and Invasion of the Body Snatchers? The culminating satire of the Obama era, or just one man?s deeply personal waking nightmare?</p>
<p>In truth, Get Out is all of the above; above all, it is the brainchild of writer-director Jordan Peele, one half of the sketch comedy duo Key &amp;amp; Peele. The movie?s basic premise could be pitched as a comedy skit: a wealthy young white woman (Allison Williams) brings her black boyfriend (Daniel Kaluuya) home for the weekend to meet her parents, whose eager profession of progressive shibboleths (?I would have voted for Obama a third time if I could!?) masks a sordid sci-fi scheme to exploit, and effectively enslave, African Americans through mind control. In lesser hands, the movie could have been a one-note send-up of liberal hypocrisy, or a strained allegory of the sins of white America. Peele avoids both traps, filling out a sketchy scenario with imaginative visual conceits while deftly mixing tones, styles, and genres into one hard-to-categorize but impossibly entertaining package.</p>
<p>Get Out works in the best traditions of both horror and comedy, code-switching naturally between the two while drawing out both genres? potential for subversive social commentary. The movie wears its cinematic influences on its sleeve?think George Romero, The Stepford Wives, and Kubrick?s The Shining for starters?but it is far more than the sum of its cinematic callbacks. Peele?s film is rife with inspired and resonant images of its own, from the nightmarish void of the Sunken Place to the midnight sprint of a possessed groundskeeper. Yet for all these otherworldly touches, Get Out is at its most unsettling when it is grounded in familiar social reality. The arresting opening visually echoes the death of Trayvon Martin, for instance, and much of the film?s disquieting dread comes from its characters? subtle diversions from expected social behaviors. Peele has a sharp ear for the ways in which members of different races and classes relate to each other, and his script cleverly subverts those social expectations to chilling (and often funny) effect. In one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1OhC9h3flY" type="external">already famous scene</a>, for instance, he derives immense tension from the linguistic distinction between ?tattle-tale? and ?snitch.?</p>
<p>Many a forgotten Oscar hopeful has strived for relevance by trying to make a statement about race; most have retreated to the comforting conventions of Great Man biopics or historical parables. Get Out, by contrast, feels vitally of the moment. Much like Spike Lee?s seminal Do the Right Thing, Peele?s debut is a surefooted entertainment that asks uneasy questions about race in America without providing easy answers, a film that implicates the audience but does not insult it. The laughs catch in your throat, the scares cause jolts of recognition?and the whole film lingers in your mind long after it is over.</p>

<p>?Whole Foods would like to apologize for labeling something organic chicken that was actually stray cats with beaks glued on them,? Colbert said.&amp;#160;</p>
<p>Another highlight: ?From now on, our ground chuck will be labeled properly. We?ll include Chuck?s last name so you know exactly who you?re eating.?</p>
<p>These pre-apologies come in the wake of a tough publicity year for Whole Foods. In June, a sting operation found that Whole Foods locations in New York were <a href="" type="internal">mislabeling the weight of their products</a> and overcharging consumers. Then, after coming under fire for using cheap inmate labor, the company&amp;#160;announced this month that it would <a href="" type="internal">stop selling tilapia and goat cheese made by prisoners</a>.</p>
<p>?Prison labor?? Colbert asked in mock dismay. ?But everything at Whole Foods is supposed to be cage-free!?</p>

<article id="0000901" published-at="2017-09-22" title="BREAKING: Trump creating NEW stricter travel ban that targets more countries?"><p>It?s being reported now that Trump is creating a new, more strict travel ban that will target more countries than his previous travel bans. And it will have no stated end date:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here?s more:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2017/09/22/trump-administration-readies-new-order-to-replace-travel-ban-wsj.html" type="external">FOX BUSINESS</a> ? The Trump administration is preparing to replace its controversial travel ban with a new order tailored on a country-by-country basis but affecting slightly more than the six nations now targeted, the Wall Street Journal said on Friday.</p>
<p>The new rules would not have a stated end date, with countries facing the potential of being added or removed from the list at any time, according to the Journal, which cited people familiar with the process.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security?s plan would replace U.S. President Donald Trump?s earlier executive order that banned travelers from six Muslim-majority countries and limited refugee admissions. The March 6 order suspended travel for people from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days and locked out most aspiring refugees for 120 days.</p>
<p>That ban, which took effect in June, is now before the Supreme Court where it faces a key hearing over its constitutionality in October. The 90-day ban expires on Sunday, while the refugee ban expires on Oct. 24.</p>
<p>?The Trump administration will ensure we only admit those who can be properly vetted and will not pose a threat to national security or public safety,? a White House official said when asked about the Journal?s story on Friday.</p>
<p>The Journal?s report said it was not immediately clear which countries would be affected by the latest restrictions, which Trump could reject or modify.</p>
<p>With that White House response it sounds like the new travel ban is definitely going to happen. Of course, you know it will be challenged in court.</p></article>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Examples: &amp;#160; [Collected via the Internet, November 2011]</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>Arrived in Oakland a few hours ago and finally we?re on our way to San Francisco.</p>
<p>We paid 25 cents at the Toll Plaza to enter this wonderful bridge that was opened four years ago. It took me awhile to get used to the traffic.</p>
<p>The bridge has two decks. The top deck is for automobiles and the bottom deck for trucks and electric trains. You can see the tracks at left. The trains are run by the Key System and Southern Pacific. They can take you all over the East Bay to wonderful places like Neptune Beach in Alameda.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We have just passed through the Yerba Buena Tunnel and can finally see San Francisco in the distance. Notice that the traffic has thinned out. Many of the cars got off the bridge at the island to go to the Golden Gate International Exposition on Treasure Island. The fair opened last year and will close for good later in 1940. I?m going to try and go there.</p>
<p>Right now we?re heading for the Mark Hopkins Hotel on Nob Hill for cocktails. It?s a great place to see San Francisco.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Isn?t this a great view of San Francisco? We?re at the lounge called the Top of the Mark. The Mark Hopkins Hotel is one of the city?s great hotels.</p>
<p>The Russ Building, by the bridge tower, is the biggest office building on the Pacific Coast. It?s 31 stories high.</p>
<p>Near the Ferry Building is the Produce District made up of small beautiful, old brick buildings. You can go there early in the morning and watch the grocers come in to pick out all kinds of vegetables.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After leaving the Mark we walked down California to Grant Avenue. Here is San Francisco?s world famous Chinatown. There are wonderful shops and the best Chinese food anywhere ? and so reasonable. You can get a large bowl of pork noodles for 35 cents.</p>
<p>Do you see the Shriner?s Flags at the top of the picture? They are having a convention in San Francisco. There is a Shriners Hospitals for Crippled Children on Nineteenth Avenue. It provides treatment for many children ever year without charge.</p>
<p>Every New Years Day the famous Shrine East West football game is held in Kezar Stadium.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After leaving Chinatown we walked down to Powell Street. Around Geary Street there are wonderful flower stands. San Francisco is sure a different place.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We?re at Powell and Market where the cable cars get turned around to go to Fisherman?s Wharf. There is a great cafeteria just a few feet from the turntable. It?s called Clinton?s and I hear the food is great.. but we plan to have dinner at Fisherman?s Wharf and that?s where we are heading.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We walked along the docks to look at hundreds of fishing boats. The one coming in here is a crab fisher. They are all painted wonderful colors and the fisherman are all Italian. They are very friendly, and we watched them sitting on the docks mending their nets and singing.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Fisherman?s Wharf has to be one of my favorite places in San Francisco. The men who do the fishing bring them back to the restaurants and outdoor stalls. People can pick out a crab and it?s cooked right there for you to take home.</p>
<p>One night we went to a great restaurant a man told me about. It?s called San Remo?s, near Fisherman?s Wharf. You can get a wonderful Italian dinner for $1.00 from soup to dessert. Another dollar gets a bottle of house wine. You go into the bar to pick it up.</p>
<p>Our waiter was very friendly.. I think he had been sampling the house wine.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>San Franciscans love the beach. The water is too cold to swim in but Playland at the Beach has everything else; a wonderful roller coaster, the Fun House, Shoot the Chutes, and great food. A favorite is Topsy?s Roost for delicious fried chicken and dancing. If you?re eating on the balcony you go down to the dance floor on a slide!</p>
<p>My favorite was the Pie Shop ? the best chicken and beef turnovers imaginable ? fantastic crust and a wonderful gravy. San Franciscans take them home for dinner.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We left Playland and drove through the Presidio to the Golden Gate Bridge. The Presidio is still an important Army Base and has been on active duty since Spain built a fort there in 1776.</p>
<p>The Golden Gate is my favorite bridge. We parked the car near the Toll Plaza and walked across the bridge for 25 cents. You can?t walk on the Bay Bridge.</p>
<p>Our trip to San Francisco is over too soon. I hate to say goodbye to this beautiful city. The people who live here are sure lucky.</p>
<p>Hope you enjoyed my letter and the photographs.</p>
<p>Say hello to everybody.</p>
<p>~ Henry Ford July 12, 1940</p>
<p></p>
<p>Origins: &amp;#160; The familiar maxim holds that ?a picture is worth a thousand words,? but sometimes images can carry much more emotional resonance when paired with just a little bit of added commentary. Such is the case with these vintage photographs of San Francisco which, while quite interesting in themselves,</p>
<p>have enchanted many viewers all the more due to the folksy, travelogue-like letter (presumably written by the photographer) to family back home that accompanies them. Even more remarkable is the revelation that the author of that charming letter was one of most famous personages of his time, American automobile pioneer Henry Ford.</p>
<p>Sadly, although the photographs are genuine, the friendly missive and the identity of its author are fabrications.</p>
<p>Back around the year 2000, a fellow named <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/SOCAL/2011-01/1296416980" type="external">Bill Roddy</a> took a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020129234805/http://www.americahurrah.com/SanFrancisco/The40s/Cover.htm" type="external">folder</a> of old photographs of San Francisco, merged them with an engaging letter he crafted describing the various scenes shown in those images, and posted the results on his <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001011023515/http://www.americahurrah.com/SanFrancisco/The40s/1.MyTrip.htm" type="external">americahurrah.com</a> web site under the title ?My Trip to San Francisco in 1940.? Other sites picked up and replicated the photo/letter combination (believing them to be real), and since most historical things seem more significant to people when associated with famous people, somewhere along the way someone added a made-up ?signature? to the letter identifying the author as auto magnate Henry Ford.</p>
<p>As an aside, we note that not only does this travelogue sound nothing like what Henry Ford would have written, but Ford was nearly 77 years old in July 1940. Even if he had visited San Francisco then, it would not have been his first trip to the City by the Bay (yet the letter is written from the perspective of someone new to those sights), and it?s hard to imagine Ford, given his fame, personality, and advanced age, enjoying the pleasures of Playland at the Beach or walking around San Francisco unrecognized at that time.</p>

<article id="0000921" title=""><p>The media is freaking out because President Obama used the N-word in an interview. No one seems as freaked out that Republican presidential candidates and Republican members of Congress took money from a conservative hate group, referenced by alleged terrorist Dylann Roof in what appears to be his manifesto. In the aftermath of the horrific killings, the same group threatened that there would be more white violence due to their inaccurate belief that there?s a double standard against white people.</p>
<p>Found on Twitter, where President Obama?s use of the n-word is trending as the media freaks out:</p>
<p><a href="https://s15130.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-22-at-12.18.26-PM.jpg" type="external"></a></p>
<p>During an interview on Marc Maron?s WTF podcast in his Los Angeles garage studio, President Obama said:</p>
<p>?Racism, we are not cured of it. And it?s not just a matter of it not being polite to say nigger in public. That?s not the measure of whether racism still exists or not. It?s not just a matter of overt discrimination. Societies don?t, overnight, completely erase everything that happened 200 to 300 years prior.?</p>
<p>Of course, the President used that word multiple times in his book ?Dreams from My Father,? in which he wrestled with his identity as a half black, half white young person.</p>
<p>The kind of discussion the President is trying to have seems to be above the capability of our sound-bite driven media. I admit it is a tough discussion for any outlet to have, because so many people don?t want to hear it and there is so much risk perceived in a discussion on race, especially when it?s done by mostly white people.</p>
<p>However, as I have written multiple times over the last few days, we need to stop whitewashing the slave trade. So much of the racism displayed in the United States is mainstreamed and results in stereotyping. It seems to me that some of this results from our collective guilt and our refusal to face it.</p>
<p>In Austria, you are faced with the reality of the actions of the Nazis at every turn. Here, a visitor wouldn?t even know about our ugly history of murder, physical abuse, kidnapping, and more. Many people proudly fly the flag that stands for these acts of atrocities. You wouldn?t see that in Germany or Austria. (I am not suggesting these two horrors are the same, but that they share enough similarities to make the observation of how other countries have handled the crimes of their past.)</p>
<p>The President spoke about covert racism on Friday, as this interview was recorded on Friday but released Monday. On Sunday, Meet the Press gave us a glaring example of covert racism by airing a segment to address shootings in America and using only black shooters, just days after a white male shot and killed nine black people in their place of worship.</p>
<p>No one is dealing with the fact that a Bush report released in 2008 warned of rising white right wing violence. No one talks about the fact that most mass shooters are white so that the profile is of a young white man. Even after a spate of documented shootings by white police officers of unarmed black people, the media thinks ?violence? and ?gun? and they go to a black person.</p>
<p>We get our sense of self-worth from the reflection of ourselves in the world around us. The impact of this kind of covert racism upon the self-esteem and identity of black people is immeasurable. It?s unacceptable.</p>
<p>This kind of daily covert racism is why President Obama talked about race impacting his identity in his books. The world expects a person with dark skin to be one thing, but each person is their own entity. As President Obama wrote in his book Dreams of My Father, ?Maybe we could afford to give the bad-a$$ed nigger pose a rest, save it for when we really need it.?</p>
<p>Most people struggle with their identity as a young person. They look around them for someone to identify with. They get these ideas from their cultural surroundings, their parents, friends and the media.</p>
<p>?If I thought to myself that when I was in college that I?d be in a garage a couple miles away from where I was living, doing an interview as president, with a comedian. It?s not possible to imagine,? President Obama said during the interview.</p>
<p>Imagine a country in which we called out white gun violence and identified white males with it as we do black men. Yes, that would be unfair to white men. Right. Because it is also unfair to black men.</p>
<p>This is just one of the ways that covert racism alters the world around us. The only way to stop it is to talk about it honestly, and to listen to the people who are experts on racism ? that would be the people who experience it, not the people who, even unknowingly, perpetrate it.</p></article>

<p>The Bandar?&amp;#160; <a href="http://www.redressonline.com/2013/01/us-patriots-vs-zionist-lobby/" type="external">Zionist lobby</a>&amp;#160;collaboration, currently the cocktail party talk of many in Washington, is not a case of strange bedfellows given three decades of mutual cooperation which started during Prince Bandar?s long tenure as Saudi ambassador in Washington. Based in Washington, but with a palace out west and up north, Bandar developed almost familial relationships with five presidents and their key advisers. His voice was one of the shrillest urging the United States to invade Iraq in 2003. In the 1980s, Prince Bandar was deeply involved in the Iran-Contra scandal in Nicaragua and it was his intelligence agency that first alerted Western allies to the alleged use of sarin gas by the Syrian regime in February. Bandar has reportedly for months been focused exclusively on garnering international support, including arms and training, for Syrian rebel factions in pursuit of the eventual toppling of President Bashar al-Assad.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the Saudi-Zionist discretely coordinated effort, confirmed by Congressional staffers working on the US House Foreign Affairs Committee as well and the US Senate Foreign Relations committee, is being led by Bandar prot?g?,&amp;#160;Adel A. al-Jubeir,&amp;#160;the current Saudi ambassador and facilitated by Bahrain ambassador&amp;#160;Houda Ezra Ebrahimis Nonoo, who is the first Jewish person, and third woman to be appointed ambassador of Bahrain. &amp;#160;Long known, for having myriad contacts at AIPAC HQ, and as an ardent Zionist, Houda Nonoo has attended lobby functions while advising&amp;#160;&amp;#160;associates that the ?Arabs must forget about the so-called Liberation of Palestine. It will never happen.?</p>

<p>The project has set its sights on achieving American involvement in its third and hopefully its fourth (the Islamic Republic) war in this region in just over one decade.</p>
<p>Labeled the ?surgical strike project?, according to one Congressional staffer, the organizers, as of 8/26/13 are blitzing US Congressional offices with ? fact sheets? making the following arguments in favor of an immediate&amp;#160;sustained air assault.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;They are being supported by the increasingly anguished cries from neo-cons in Congress such as John McCain, Lindsey Graham and their ilk.</p>
<p>The lobby?s missive details calculations why the project will succeed and turn out to be a political plus for Obama who is increasingly being accused, by this same team, of dithering. Bandar is arguing that Syrian threats to retaliate against Israel is only political posturing because Syria has never and will never launch a war against Israel, has no military capacity to do so and for the reason that Israel could level Damascus and the Baathist regime knows this well.</p>
<p>In addition, the Prince and his partners insist that Iran will do nothing but complain because it has too much to lose. Iran will not response other than verbally and has no history of attacking the US or Israel and would not risk the unpredictable consequences of a military response by the Republic Guards or even some of its backed militia in Iraq or Syria. Sources in Tehran have reported otherwise to this observer.</p>
<p>Hezbollah, it is claimed, will not act without orders from Tehran which has instructed it to maintain its heavy weapons in&amp;#160;moth balls&amp;#160;until the coming ?big war? with Israel..&amp;#160;&amp;#160;It is widely agreed that if Israel attacks Iran, the region will ignite with Hezbollah playing an important role in targeting occupied Palestine.</p>
<p>McCain, a former pilot in Vietnam, is even pushing ?weapons to be employed? list, which includes advising the White House and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on how to do their jobs.&amp;#160;Congressional sources report that there is tension between McCain and the Pentagon because the Senator is implying that the Pentagon doesn?t know its job or what assets it has available and how to use them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Saudi official acknowledges that a military strike is a game changer, especially for Russia and that it will kill any diplomatic initiative (including Geneva II), meaning that Russia will lose a serious advantage in Syria. This also means that Russia will lose its bargaining chips which could have bought them the consensus they need, political or economic. But this does not mean that Russia will stand up to the U.S. militarily, as the losses in this case would be more severe. All this is reportedly acceptable to the Prince and the lobby.</p>
<p>The timing of such an attack according to knowledgeable sources in Damascus and Washington would probably last no more than two days and involve sea-launched cruise missiles and long-range bombers.</p>
<p>Reportedly, striking military targets not directly related to Syria?s chemical weapons arsenal, hinges on three factors: completion of an intelligence report assessing Syrian government culpability for the chemical attack; continuing consultation with allies and Congress; and the Department of States International Law Bureau preparing the justification under international law.</p>
<p>One of the most common phases being uttered by AIPAC to congressional offices this week are the words, ?Assad?s massive use of chemical weapons?.</p>
<p>Bandar has reportedly agreed that Israel can call the shots but that the air assault will be led by the US and involve roughly two dozen US allies including Turkey, the UK and France. The German weekly ?Focus? reported on 8/26/13 that the IDF?s 8200 intelligence unlit bugged the Syrian leadership during the chemical weapons attack last week and that Israel ?sold? the incriminating information to the White House.</p>
<p>A group from Israel arrived in Washington on 8/26/13.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;It included the Director of the Political-Security Staff in the Defense Ministry, Jaj. Gen. (res) Amos Gilad, Director of Planning Branch Maj. Gen. Nimrod Shefer and IDF intelligence Research Department Director Brigadier General Ital Brun. After some intense discussions, they shared some of their tapes with US officials.</p>
<p>The Bandar/AIPAC arguments being, pushed by this delegation and being spread around Capitol Hill as part of ?Israel sharing its sterling intelligence? can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>The US must avoid half measures to pursue a limited punitive response to the CW use. What is needed is a sustained Bosnia style bombing campaign until Bashar al-Assad is removed from office. Giving in to that temptation would be a mistake.</p>
<p>The use of the CW affords President Obama an, underserved opportunity to correct his errant Middle East policies. As Israel?s agent, Robert Satloff of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy ( WINEP) is telling anyone who is willing to listen, ?Obama?s deep reluctance to engage in Syria is clear to all. This hesitancy is part of his policy to wind down U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan and his championing of the idea of ?nation building at home.? It is not understandable and to the millions of Americans who see Syria as a heaven-sent contest between radical Shiites and radical Sunnis, it is unwise and inappropriate. ?</p>
<p>According to the Saudi?s,? the Obama administration now faces Bashar al-Assad?s regime and its Iranian sponsors who&amp;#160;&amp;#160;believe they can put a stake through the heart of U.S. power and prestige in the region by testing the president?s ?red line? on the use of chemical weapons (CW). ? WINEP is arguing in a memo just issued,&amp;#160;? For Assad, large-scale use of CW serves multiple ends ? it demoralizes the rebels, underscores the impotence of their external financiers and suppliers, and confirms to Assad?s own patrons that he is committed to fight to the bitter end. For the Iranians, Assad?s CW use makes Syria ? not Iran?s nuclear facilities ? the battlefield to test American resolve.?</p>
<p>For Bander and his Zionist collaborators, the key issue is not whether Obama authorizes the use of American force as a response to Syria?s use of CW. Rather, the key imperative is that the U.S. use whatever force is necessary to achieve regime change and choose the next regime assuring that it will be friendly to Israel.</p>
<p>WINEP and AIPAC are arguing that If the US military action is designed to only punish Assad for violating the international norm on CW,? it will merely have the effect of defining for Assad the acceptable tools for mass killing ? perhaps only the acceptable quantities of CW to use at any given time ? and will have little impact on the outcome of the Syrian conflict; in fact, it might just embolden Assad and his allies.?</p>
<p>Bandar has told Congressional friends who he has known for decades, that if American military action must be designed to alter the balance of power between the various rebel groups and the Syrian/Iranian/Hezbollah alliance, this will require a wholesale change in U.S. on-the-ground strategy to supply and train well-vetted opposition militias.</p>
<p>For Israel and its agents, the worst of all is victory by the Assad/Iranian/Hezbollah axis, which a brief but fiery barrage of cruise missiles is liable to bring about. A global power thousands of miles away cannot calibrate stalemate to ensure that neither party wins; we have to prioritize the most negative outcomes and use our assets to prevent them.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The Bandar-Zionist project is still not irreversible. The Pentagon and especially Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey, are very concerned and have threatened to resign in protest.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;For they realize that there is a grave risk that the Syrian response will lead to a clash with one of its neighbors, a US ally.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Any scenario is possible from the moment that the first missile leaves American ships in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Sources in Iran and Syria have advised this observer that they expect the US bombing to commence within 72 hours.</p>

<p>The Norwegian government announced yesterday that it is giving a 37 percent boost to funding for renewable energy projects, citing a large increase in the number of project proposals. Meanwhile, U.S. environmentalists wish their government had the same foresight. Arizona averages more than 300 sunny days a year, but people working in the solar industry say that?s not enough to give solar energy the boost it needs to go big time in the state. More tax breaks and government incentives are necessary, they say. A bill in the Arizona House would extend one tax exemption to contractors who install solar devices in homes. Solar advocates also hope that new technology will bring down the cost of solar energy systems.</p></article>
